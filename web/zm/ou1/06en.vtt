00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:07.639
Oh, geez, what kind of city show I'm watching last week?

2
00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:20.129
It's so interesting about this cheap attention war.

3
00:00:20.129 --> 00:00:28.890
What's it for?

4
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.740
Well, I've never seen this side of her before.

5
00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:42.619
Oh, I got it. Emily, her Jasmine is out here,

6
00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:45.219
falling around with another guy.

7
00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:46.219
I'll go get her.

8
00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:50.229
Wait, I want to see what she's up to.

9
00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.549
Oh, goddammit, I work so hard to make him hate Jasmine.

10
00:00:54.549 --> 00:01:00.979
My plans can't get messed out today.

11
00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:04.819
Patrick, dude, it's been a long time.

12
00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:10.469
Why haven't you been to your favorite bar for so long?

13
00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:13.670
So this is also your favorite bar?

14
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:14.790
Hell, yeah.

15
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.909
He's been storing his liquor here since college days.

16
00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.950
He practically owns half the bar.

17
00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:21.750
What do you care?

18
00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.430
Instead of messing around while you're drunk,

19
00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.390
you should be getting ready to join me at the lunch event.

20
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.950
There will be many high profile people at the event.

21
00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.340
Jasmine might fail out of place after being a housewife.

22
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.140
We are married.

23
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.590
Of course she will be coming with me.

24
00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.230
Hey, I'm not going to the lunch event.
