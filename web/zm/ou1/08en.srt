1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:04,660
It feels like she's a completely different person.

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:10,060
It's just the coincidence. You just guess the name.

3
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:11,060
I won't.

4
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:18,230
Fine. You can skip the event.

5
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:23,230
Fine. Stay your lane. You never deserve to be Patrick's plus one.

6
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:26,550
So... save your embarrassment.

7
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:30,059
Eh, wait a second.

8
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:39,439
Maybe I'll go in a tent after all.

9
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:44,439
In the car to the event tomorrow, it'll just be the two of us.

10
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:47,439
The hubby and the wifey.

11
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:56,229
Patrick, we agreed to go together.

12
00:00:56,229 --> 00:01:01,840
I'll be gone with my wife. You can go by yourself, you know, the way.
