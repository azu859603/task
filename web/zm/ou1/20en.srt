00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
Look right here. This is my restaurant's gifts report.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,360
Proving that you falsely using me of everything.

3
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:10,560
You must apologize to me. Right now.

4
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:14,990
You know, damn well, how you got this gifts report.

5
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:16,829
Do you want me to tell everyone?

6
00:00:18,859 --> 00:00:21,179
He just jealous of me. She bought...

7
00:00:21,179 --> 00:00:23,120
Bibi! Enough.

8
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:26,059
Are you defending her?

9
00:00:27,219 --> 00:00:29,699
I won fair and square.

10
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:37,299
Not only did I get the authorization, but Isaac also allowed me to exhibit the most famous painting.

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,560
What? Is this Isaac's painting?

12
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,200
Why are we still standing here?

13
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,320
Hurry up and find some way to contact Isaac.

14
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,679
I'm sorry, but I really couldn't find any way to reach the artist.

15
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:05,170
This is what Mrs. Miller painted for you and your first anniversary.

16
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:12,060
So beautiful. Why could I not remember this?

17
00:01:13,219 --> 00:01:17,459
You were too overwhelmed by the company crisis at that time to focus on anything else.

18
00:01:19,099 --> 00:01:21,819
Mrs. Miller was really sad for a long time because of this.

19
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:43,260
It's urgent. Find out if Jasmine and Isaac have any connection. Why didn't you ever tell me?
