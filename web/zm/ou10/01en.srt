1
00:00:02,379 --> 00:00:05,080
These are the stats from the last quarter.

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:08,679
Our group's market shares have decreased 10%.

3
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:11,179
However, it's explainable.

4
00:00:11,179 --> 00:00:15,369
This is unacceptable.

5
00:00:15,369 --> 00:00:20,219
My name is Jade Spencer.

6
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:23,019
I'm a marketing specialist for the Morgan Group.

7
00:00:23,019 --> 00:00:26,219
Officially, I report to the boss in front of me.

8
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:29,469
But privately.

9
00:00:29,469 --> 00:00:31,870
If you just look at the data at Mr. Morgan,

10
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:34,869
Kramer from her suitables released a new drugless quarter,

11
00:00:34,869 --> 00:00:36,070
which explains why...

12
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:39,340
I don't want excuses.

13
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:43,240
If we do not improve by the end of this fiscal year,

14
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:46,640
then you all are fired.

15
00:00:46,640 --> 00:01:10,560
Understood.

16
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:34,060
Mr. Morgan, so you know that word due to a meeting is adjourned.

17
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:38,799
Why don't you come to my office and finish your report?
