1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,560
Drop the act. Isn't this what you want to hook up with the rich guy?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:17,250
Don't look at me like that. You were the one who left me for money. Do you remember that?

3
00:00:23,059 --> 00:00:28,519
Bruce is still hurt from what happened. I have to tell him the truth

4
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:33,579
Even if I no longer deserve to be with him, I still can ease his pain

5
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,640
Doctor, my mother, how is she?

6
00:00:37,479 --> 00:00:42,119
Stable but still I'm responsive. Unfortunately, a comic had last months or even years

7
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:45,280
Even with insurance your family should prepare for the cause

8
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:09,640
Mr. Morgan get out. I know you don't want me here. I just have one thing to say and then I'll leave

9
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,819
You've come into my office

10
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:20,700
Unannounced and you think that I'm willing to hear what you have to say just because you're my ex doesn't mean you get some sort of special

11
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:21,980
privilege

12
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:24,859
I'm sorry. I'll step out and knock

13
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,900
I am not the same man that you knew before

14
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:36,739
And I'm not going to be at your back and call and even if you did want me back

15
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:41,060
You don't deserve me

16
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:44,549
Darling did you?

17
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:45,939
Jade?

18
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,180
Regina?

19
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:51,349
Miss Spencer. This is my fiance

20
00:01:52,489 --> 00:01:54,939
Regina Spencer

21
00:01:55,829 --> 00:01:57,829
You're engaged
