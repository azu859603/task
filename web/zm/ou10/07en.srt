1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I really should thank you, sis.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
If you hadn't ditched Bruce for such a rich rando,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I wouldn't have ended up such a fine man.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Don't you call me that!

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I am not your sister!

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Ever since your father cheated on my mother and me,

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,539
and kicked us out of the house, I got ties with all of you!

8
00:00:17,539 --> 00:00:19,539
I'm sorry, weren't you supposed to tell me something?

9
00:00:19,539 --> 00:00:22,539
I'm resigning.

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,760
Are you?

11
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:30,679
Well, it sounds like you haven't read the contract because...

12
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:32,679
because there's a special clause in there that states...

13
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:37,679
You have to pay me half a million dollars if you were to quit without my permission.

14
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:40,869
And I don't think you have that kind of money.

15
00:00:40,869 --> 00:00:41,869
Do you?

16
00:00:41,869 --> 00:00:44,899
You wouldn't.

17
00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:45,899
What I did.

18
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:48,789
Jade, go get me coffee.

19
00:00:48,789 --> 00:00:50,789
This is not in my job description.

20
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:53,079
You listen to what she has to say.

21
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:54,079
Here's your tip.

22
00:00:54,079 --> 00:01:04,200
Poor.

23
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:08,349
I'm gonna go live the life that I deserve.

24
00:01:08,349 --> 00:01:09,480
Stop, Dexter!

25
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,480
Stop!

26
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,480
Take this!
