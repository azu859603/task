1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,540
He's gone. He'll have someone else now.

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:09,060
Bringing up our past will just make me look pathetic.

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:15,900
Bruce, I guess I really lost you.

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,899
Bruce, what are you doing?

5
00:00:17,899 --> 00:00:23,300
This is a company parking lot. Somebody might see us.

6
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:28,059
You landed the guy who could get you everything.

7
00:00:28,059 --> 00:00:31,190
You're still driving this joker. It's not.

8
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:34,189
It's not of your business. Get lost.

9
00:00:34,189 --> 00:00:37,259
What are you doing? You're engaged.

10
00:00:37,259 --> 00:00:41,609
It doesn't matter. You and your sister were the same just as Vayne.

11
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:44,609
Even if she found out she wouldn't do anything.

12
00:00:44,609 --> 00:00:47,609
Because she still wants to hold her position as CEO's wife.

13
00:00:47,609 --> 00:00:49,609
Get lost.
