1
00:00:01,139 --> 00:00:04,519
You think you could tell me to go anywhere?

2
00:00:04,519 --> 00:00:08,220
You were the one who hurt me. Now tell me.

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,320
Have you even for a second regretted your decision?

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,480
I have never regretted my decision.

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:24,399
Well then you're not going to get away with this.

6
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:30,600
You crazy? What are you doing?

7
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:36,450
I'm just playing around. I'm going to take it so seriously.

8
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:43,520
Don't get all soft now. You're out for revenge.

9
00:00:43,520 --> 00:01:02,060
Close your eyes.

10
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:03,060
Okay.

11
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:06,569
Make a wish.

12
00:01:06,569 --> 00:01:29,299
I wish to spend every birthday with you for the rest of our lives.

13
00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:34,019
Thank you.

14
00:01:34,019 --> 00:01:39,780
Maybe it's better if you hate me forever. I hurt you so badly.

15
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:43,879
You deserve a better life. One without me.

16
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:53,469
Finally, I've been trying to get ahold of your mom.

17
00:01:53,469 --> 00:01:54,469
What happened to mom?
