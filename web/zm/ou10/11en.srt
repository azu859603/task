1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Uh, how can I return this to you?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I'll walk you home. You can just give it back to me once we get there.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,480
It's my fault. I want to make sure you're okay.

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,480
Sure, thank you.

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:24,219
Nah, keep it. It looks cool on you.

6
00:00:24,219 --> 00:00:27,219
Ah, that's sweet of you.

7
00:00:27,219 --> 00:00:31,699
And thank you for walking me home. Good night.

8
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:32,700
Bye.

9
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:42,979
Who was that guy?

10
00:00:42,979 --> 00:00:43,979
Who you following me?

11
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:45,979
Answer the question. Who was the guy?

12
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:49,490
That's none of your business. We're over.

13
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:51,490
Don't make yourself look pathetic.

14
00:00:51,490 --> 00:01:10,799
Hey, Jade. Think I sent over here?

15
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:11,799
Mrs. Bruce.

16
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:18,060
Where's Jade? Put her on the phone now.

17
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,659
I'll give you one guess.

18
00:01:20,659 --> 00:01:24,530
Where is she, Bruce?

19
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:27,939
She's a little bit busy. I wore her out.

20
00:01:27,939 --> 00:01:40,120
I need the next flight out of LA.

21
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,120
Mr. Morgan?

22
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,629
Command.

23
00:01:42,629 --> 00:01:51,719
Mr. Morgan, I left my phone somewhere here last night.

24
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:54,359
Any chance you found it?

25
00:01:54,359 --> 00:02:01,769
Yeah, you didn't go through it, did you?

26
00:02:01,769 --> 00:02:03,769
I just answered one call.

27
00:02:03,769 --> 00:02:07,560
Relax.

28
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,939
I told him nothing happened between us.

29
00:02:10,939 --> 00:02:14,069
Even though I don't know if your sugar daddy bought it.

30
00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:19,000
He talked to Dexter? What else did you tell him?

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You seem to be very concerned about him.

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:29,030
It looks like he really is your sugar daddy.

33
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:33,030
The Morgan group's assets more than ten times is.

34
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:36,639
So why don't I just be your sugar daddy instead?

35
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:40,180
What are you doing? You're engaged to Regina.

36
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:44,180
Even if I was married, it wouldn't matter.

37
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,729
It'd just be another thing.

38
00:02:46,729 --> 00:02:51,139
I would never be just a fling.

39
00:02:51,139 --> 00:03:02,939
You write any number on this check and I'll sign it.

40
00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:07,330
Take your money. I told you. We're over.

41
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:12,740
You can say you're a little crocodile, too.

42
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,740
They don't work on me anymore.

43
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:18,740
And even if you won't be with me, I have ways to keep you on my side.

44
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,800
Enough!

45
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,800
How dare you touch her!

46
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,599
What are you doing here?

47
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:28,860
The second I saw Bruce picked up your phone, I knew how to get over here as soon as I got it.

48
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,860
What gives you the right to speak for her?

49
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,889
Mom, let's go.

50
00:03:32,889 --> 00:03:36,460
She's not going anywhere.

51
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:40,460
Unlike Bruce, I respect whatever decision you make. The choice is yours.

52
00:03:40,460 --> 00:04:02,169
I'm sorry, Bruce.

53
00:04:02,169 --> 00:04:04,099
No.

54
00:04:04,099 --> 00:04:13,840
Thank you for helping me.

55
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,639
Jay and I...

56
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:17,639
Listen, we're such good friends.

57
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:19,740
And we'll always be good friends.

58
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:25,399
I don't want you to bother helping me like this anymore.

59
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:29,009
Do you still love Bruce?

60
00:04:29,009 --> 00:04:33,009
After everything that's happened to me and things have done, I just...

61
00:04:33,009 --> 00:04:36,029
I don't even think I can be loved anymore.

62
00:04:36,029 --> 00:04:45,500
When you're ready to be loved again, I'll be here.

63
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:55,120
And when you're ready to love again, I'll still be here for you.

64
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,279
I scheduled the FaceTime call with the doctor in Switzerland.

65
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:00,279
We're gonna talk about your mom, okay?

66
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:19,529
What do you want, Bruce?

67
00:05:19,529 --> 00:05:21,620
Hi, in the shade?

68
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,620
Yeah? Who's this?

69
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,720
I'm working at Night Rest Bar.

70
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,720
This guy is really drunk and you're in his emergency contact.

71
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,300
Could you come pick him up?

72
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:46,579
I'm his, what? Bruce.

73
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:58,139
Wow, I must have drinking one too many drinks because...

74
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:06,529
Jay, this can't really be you, is it?

75
00:06:06,529 --> 00:06:09,689
It is. I'm taking you home.

76
00:06:09,689 --> 00:06:11,689
No, no, no. Hold on one second. Hold on.

77
00:06:11,689 --> 00:06:16,670
I've accomplished a lot.

78
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:20,670
And I've had a lot of successes and you still don't want to be with me.

79
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:30,480
Because after all these years, we should have learned to focus on the future.

80
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:38,000
You're supposed to be my future and I hate you.

81
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,100
But I hate myself even more.

82
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:55,209
Keep asking myself why I can't forget about you and about us, about what we could have been.

83
00:06:55,209 --> 00:06:59,970
But you know what I've given up on trying to forget?

84
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:09,459
I have. I just want to know.

85
00:07:09,459 --> 00:07:24,959
Why can't we start over? I can be better. I promise that I'll be better. I'll be better.

86
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:40,949
How are you five? I'll take care of my love.

87
00:07:40,949 --> 00:07:50,199
Bruce, where's the key? Where's the key?

88
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:51,199
Hold on.

89
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:56,339
How do you know what was there?

90
00:07:56,339 --> 00:08:06,079
Old habit.

91
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:15,480
Which means I'll be taking care of him. Good night.

92
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,480
Guess he doesn't need me anymore.

93
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:32,870
Because she dumped you for another man. Why do you still have that?

94
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:38,710
What are you doing?

95
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:41,159
Darling, so you're not drunk?

96
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,159
What?

97
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,159
Are you using me to get Jay Jealous?

98
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:47,470
Jealous?

99
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:50,470
I'm the one you're engaged to. Doesn't our relationship mean something?

100
00:08:50,470 --> 00:09:09,559
Don't make me say it again.

101
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:12,559
You look tired. Didn't get much sleep, huh?

102
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:16,559
Oh, well, my love had a bit too much to drink last night, so I stayed over.

103
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:19,070
Not that he would have let me leave anyway.

104
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:21,070
Men are so needy when they're drunk.

105
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:26,399
What's the matter, dear sister?

106
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,820
Are you jealous I was at my fiancÃ©'s house last night?

107
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,820
It's a weird thing to be jealous of.

108
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:36,679
Your private life is your own concern, Regina. I'm not interested.

109
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:45,620
Oh, is that so?

110
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:48,620
Well, how come I remember you taking me home last night?

111
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:52,899
What? Did I say something strange?

112
00:09:52,899 --> 00:10:00,419
Why can't we start over? I can be better.

113
00:10:00,419 --> 00:10:04,519
Nothing.

114
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:10,200
We're gonna have our wedding next month.

115
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,970
You should be the bride's maid. You are her sister, after all.

116
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:18,450
We are gonna have such a beautiful wedding.

117
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:20,450
No, it's okay.

118
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:50,220
Come in. You don't look well.

119
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:54,110
It's because my announcement upset you.

120
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:56,429
Have you changed your mind about us?

121
00:10:56,429 --> 00:11:00,039
Neither. I'm here to resign.

122
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:05,299
My resignation letter.

123
00:11:05,299 --> 00:11:07,299
You want to leave me?

124
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:09,879
What's wrong with you? You just announced your wedding.

125
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:11,879
You have to let me go.

126
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:17,179
I will never let you go.

127
00:11:17,179 --> 00:11:20,080
You can never leave.

128
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:26,299
You're hurt.

129
00:11:26,299 --> 00:11:29,490
It's none of your business.

130
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:43,049
I'm off the clock. My arm is injured.

131
00:11:43,049 --> 00:11:46,049
But why do I only feel pain in my heart?

132
00:11:46,049 --> 00:11:48,870
Hello?

133
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:51,289
We've run into a problem.

134
00:11:51,289 --> 00:11:53,289
What happened? With my mom?

135
00:11:53,289 --> 00:11:58,289
Your mother needs a specific medication for her treatment, but we don't carry it here.

136
00:11:58,289 --> 00:12:00,289
Okay, well, how do I get it?

137
00:12:00,289 --> 00:12:05,289
I'm sending you the details. It's in limited supply globally.

138
00:12:05,289 --> 00:12:09,590
Jade, I'm just on my way to come back.

139
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:11,659
Have you been crying? What's wrong?

140
00:12:11,659 --> 00:12:14,659
My mom needs medication and I don't know where to find it.

141
00:12:14,659 --> 00:12:15,659
What's the medication?

142
00:12:15,659 --> 00:12:18,850
It's this.

143
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:22,100
Okay, I've heard all about this. Don't worry about it.

144
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,259
My friend and pharmaceuticals told me all about it.

145
00:12:24,259 --> 00:12:25,259
I can definitely get a look.

146
00:12:25,259 --> 00:12:30,019
Really? Thank you so much.

147
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:32,019
Let me know how much it is. I'll be you back.

148
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:33,019
You don't need a look about it.

149
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:44,470
Bruce, why are you still fooling yourself?

150
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:46,470
She already belongs to someone else.

151
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:54,720
Bruce, what are you doing here?

152
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,720
It's been for me?

153
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,779
Of course. We have a cake testing to go to.

154
00:12:58,779 --> 00:12:59,779
For the wedding.

155
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:06,100
Do you guys plan on coming along?

156
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:16,690
Jade and I actually have friends.

157
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:17,820
Stop.

158
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:18,820
Bruce!

159
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,820
You can go to the tasting of your own. I'm busy.

160
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:27,340
Jade, I won't let you win.

161
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:32,139
Competitors are already contacting Greco Group for partnership deals.

162
00:13:32,139 --> 00:13:35,139
Why are you just sitting around? Get on it.

163
00:13:35,139 --> 00:13:42,580
Head of Greco Group never takes meetings.

164
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:45,580
Let's see what Bruce has to say when you come back empty-handed.

165
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:54,370
I'm from the Morgan Group's marketing department.

166
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:57,370
I'm here to see the head of the pharmaceutical division.

167
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,500
Appointment confirmation?

168
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,779
I don't have any.

169
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:02,779
No appointment. No entrance.

170
00:14:02,779 --> 00:14:04,779
Can you maybe make an exception for me?

171
00:14:04,779 --> 00:14:06,779
Move it along, Bruce.

172
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:19,559
Morning, boss.

173
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:20,559
It's okay. You can have that.

174
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:22,659
Boss.

175
00:14:22,659 --> 00:14:24,659
You're the head of Kekka?

176
00:14:24,659 --> 00:14:26,909
That's right.

177
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:31,330
And since Morgan sent you for this project, I'll make sure you get it.

178
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:39,960
Thank you so much, Dax, for helping me with the project.

179
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,960
My pleasure.

180
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,960
The dinner's on me.

181
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,960
I'll write it to whatever you'll think.

182
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,960
Don't mind if I do.

183
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:57,179
Look who it is, my dear sister.

184
00:14:57,179 --> 00:15:00,409
The Greco Project is in critical condition yet.

185
00:15:00,409 --> 00:15:03,409
You have time for a date. You must really care about your work.

186
00:15:03,409 --> 00:15:06,409
Let's go. We can find someplace else to eat.

187
00:15:06,409 --> 00:15:11,230
No. We have the space. Why don't you join us?

188
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:15,539
Unless you're held up in the past.

189
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:20,519
No. He's right.

190
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:27,299
Jade, how was it going with Greco's room?

191
00:15:27,299 --> 00:15:29,299
Tell me you haven't made any progress today.

192
00:15:29,299 --> 00:15:32,809
You haven't heard? She killed the project this morning.

193
00:15:32,809 --> 00:15:34,809
That's impossible.

194
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:37,159
Sweetie, it's actually not.

195
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:40,600
I got the email earlier this morning.

196
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:51,279
It must you get everything.

197
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:52,279
Why?

198
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:59,110
Blind? Watch where you're going.

199
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:01,110
So sorry.

200
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:05,100
Is that for Mr. Morgan's table?

201
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,100
Yes, please give him my deepest apologies.

202
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,100
I'll bring another one out right away.

203
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,320
You're in for it now, Jade.

204
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:14,419
Hope you're not still allergic to peanuts.

205
00:16:14,419 --> 00:16:17,379
Not a problem.

206
00:16:17,379 --> 00:16:20,379
Actually, could you have them remake it and this time add some peanut butter?

207
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:23,379
Oh, Mr. Morgan loves chocolate and peanut butter.

208
00:16:23,379 --> 00:16:25,379
I don't know if we can.

209
00:16:25,379 --> 00:16:37,330
Just do it.

210
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:40,330
Bruce, you have to try their shrimp. It's their specialty.

211
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:42,330
You know what? I hate peeling my own shrimp, girl.

212
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:44,940
Don't worry. I'll peel it for you.

213
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:59,580
You're eating them faster than I could peel them.

214
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:00,580
Let me do this.

215
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:02,580
You should have some for yourself.

216
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:03,580
No, I don't mind.

217
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:06,869
I actually really enjoy peeling shrimp.

218
00:17:06,869 --> 00:17:07,869
Really?

219
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:08,940
Yeah.

220
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:12,029
It means I get to see you enjoy it more.

221
00:17:12,029 --> 00:17:23,980
We're the best.

222
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:26,430
What is your favorite?

223
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:30,000
To celebrate the success of the Gaka Project.

224
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,130
It's really sweet of you, Dex.

225
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:45,680
Thank you.

226
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,680
Jade, is everything okay?

227
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,680
What's wrong with this cake?

228
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,680
Jade! Jade!

229
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,680
There's peanut butter in this cake.

230
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,680
Is this how you treat her? There's peanut butter in this cake!

231
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,680
I told them no nuts!

232
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,680
Jade!

233
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,730
Bruce!

234
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:56,180
Get out of my way.

235
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,180
It was you, wasn't it?

236
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,240
I don't know what you're talking about.

237
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,240
I'm not playing these stupid little games anymore, Regina.

238
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,529
You're the only one dumb enough to try and pull them off like this.

239
00:19:04,529 --> 00:19:08,529
Even if it was me, there's nothing you can do about it.

240
00:19:08,529 --> 00:19:12,740
I'm gonna give you your first and final warning.

241
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:16,809
If you ever try to hurt Jade again, I will end you.

242
00:19:16,809 --> 00:19:17,809
Understand?

243
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Let go.

244
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,480
You hurt me.

245
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:29,779
Don't tell her that I was here.

246
00:19:29,779 --> 00:19:33,339
How was my sister?

247
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:38,380
You're scaring me.

248
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:40,380
How dare you hurt her.

249
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,109
Shut up.

250
00:19:42,109 --> 00:19:46,109
If anything happens, then I promise we'll make your life a living hell.

251
00:19:46,109 --> 00:19:53,099
Do you understand?

252
00:19:53,099 --> 00:19:56,490
Jade, you won't be so lucky next time.

253
00:19:56,490 --> 00:20:04,799
You know, maybe you should say another night.

254
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:05,799
Rest up.

255
00:20:05,799 --> 00:20:06,799
Make sure you're feeling okay.

256
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:16,170
Jade, you must be discharged by now, right?

257
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:19,299
Don't act too concerned, Regina.

258
00:20:19,299 --> 00:20:23,299
Since you've recovered, why don't you come with me as my maid of honor and help pick out wedding dresses?

259
00:20:23,299 --> 00:20:24,299
What?

260
00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:27,279
What's going on?

261
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:30,279
Regina wants me to go wedding dress shopping with her.

262
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:32,500
I'm a maid of honor, remember?

263
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,500
That's insane.

264
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:38,140
If I don't go, she'll never let it go, so I'll be fine.

265
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:42,240
All right, well, I guess I can pick you up when I'm done at the office then.

266
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:47,700
These are all our new arrivals.

267
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,700
This one's gorgeous.

268
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,799
Bruce, what do you think?

269
00:20:51,799 --> 00:21:01,380
It's okay.

270
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,380
Drive safe.

271
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,380
I'll see you soon.

272
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,730
Bruce!

273
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:10,839
Yes, I'm sure you'll look incredible at all.

274
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:13,839
Or if you'd like a longer train, we also have these.

275
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:21,309
You don't deserve that.

276
00:21:21,309 --> 00:21:31,619
So, do you see anything you like?

277
00:21:31,619 --> 00:21:35,559
No.

278
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:37,559
Come on, let's go.

279
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:39,710
Hey, wait.

280
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:46,740
One day, I will buy you the most magnificent dress with a ring to match.

281
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:51,400
Did anyone ever tell you how sweet you are?

282
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,400
No, because I'm always sweet to you.

283
00:21:53,400 --> 00:22:08,299
You don't deserve that.

284
00:22:08,299 --> 00:22:10,509
I don't want it.

285
00:22:10,509 --> 00:22:13,240
Come help me change.

286
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:29,579
Buy the whole store?

287
00:22:29,579 --> 00:22:32,339
Listen, sweetheart.

288
00:22:32,339 --> 00:22:36,339
If I ask Brucey to do just that, he would.

289
00:22:36,339 --> 00:22:41,339
So keep being a cute little pack mule and stay quiet.

290
00:22:41,339 --> 00:22:42,859
Duxter?

291
00:22:42,859 --> 00:22:45,660
Looks like I came just in time.

292
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:46,660
The bullying's done.

293
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:47,660
What the hell?

294
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,660
Jade won't be joining you anymore.

295
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,660
And why not?

296
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:56,279
Because we have our own wedding planning to do.

297
00:22:56,279 --> 00:22:57,279
What?

298
00:22:57,279 --> 00:22:58,279
You two are getting...

299
00:22:58,279 --> 00:22:59,279
Engaged?

300
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:00,279
Of course.

301
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:07,559
Don't tell me you didn't know.

302
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:08,559
Excuse me, miss.

303
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:09,559
Yes.

304
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:12,559
My fiance would love to try your most extravagant necklace.

305
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,559
Of course, sir.

306
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:19,720
That's what I wanted.

307
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,720
That's mine.

308
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,720
It's gorgeous.

309
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:27,500
Do you like it?

310
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,500
Perfect.

311
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,500
I'll take it.

312
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:32,569
Oh, excellent choice, sir.

313
00:23:32,569 --> 00:23:39,099
You're right.

314
00:23:39,099 --> 00:23:41,099
It looks stunning on your fiance.

315
00:23:41,099 --> 00:23:48,539
Just keep playing along.

316
00:23:48,539 --> 00:23:52,859
Oh, and by the way, your mother's just boning really well to the treatment.

317
00:23:52,859 --> 00:23:55,789
You can face something they did not if you'd like.

318
00:23:55,789 --> 00:23:56,789
Oh, my God.

319
00:23:56,789 --> 00:23:57,789
This means so much to me.

320
00:23:57,789 --> 00:23:59,430
Thank you.

321
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:00,430
Happy to help.

322
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:04,430
You certainly are easy to please.

323
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:06,430
Getting this worked up over a mere necklace.

324
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:13,259
I don't know about you, Bruce, but I'm happy to give Jade anything she wants.

325
00:24:13,259 --> 00:24:16,259
Oh, and word of advice.

326
00:24:16,259 --> 00:24:18,380
Those who can't give.

327
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:20,859
They just turn out better.

328
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:27,019
Come on.

329
00:24:27,019 --> 00:24:28,019
Do you see anything you like?

330
00:24:28,019 --> 00:24:31,170
Not really.

331
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:35,160
Well, we'll keep looking until we find your perfect dress.

332
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:38,160
Speaking of, what is your perfect dress?

333
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:41,309
It's silly.

334
00:24:41,309 --> 00:24:42,309
No, please.

335
00:24:42,309 --> 00:24:43,599
Come on.

336
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:44,599
Tell me.

337
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:48,599
Well, I always wanted a dress covered in a million diamonds.

338
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:50,599
And with some tool.

339
00:24:50,599 --> 00:24:53,599
So it looks like a night full of stars.

340
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:56,599
Bruce, I'm still here.

341
00:24:56,599 --> 00:25:05,960
You once told me the same thing.

342
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,960
Nobody move.

343
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,299
Hands up.

344
00:25:10,299 --> 00:25:11,299
Get on the floor.

345
00:25:11,299 --> 00:25:16,430
Empty the register.

346
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:17,430
Take everything out the cases.

347
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:18,430
Put it in the bag.

348
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:19,940
Whoa.

349
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:22,200
Please don't hurt me.

350
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,200
The girl in the pink dress has the most expensive necklace on.

351
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,299
You.

352
00:25:26,299 --> 00:25:27,299
Take the necklace off.

353
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:28,299
Bring it over here.

354
00:25:28,299 --> 00:25:32,309
Jade just toss it to me.

355
00:25:32,309 --> 00:25:33,309
Stay back.

356
00:25:33,309 --> 00:25:34,309
You get over there.

357
00:25:34,309 --> 00:25:35,700
Hey, lady.

358
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,700
We don't have all day.

359
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,400
Jade, don't.

360
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,400
Jade, Jade.

361
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:46,319
You too.

362
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:47,319
Cross over there.

363
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:54,660
You're fine.

364
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:55,660
You're fine.

365
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:56,660
Hey.

366
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:57,660
Get the shit.

367
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:58,660
I'll come out on one.

368
00:25:58,660 --> 00:25:59,660
No, no time.

369
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:00,660
No time.

370
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:01,660
I'll try.

371
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:10,529
Let's go.

372
00:26:10,529 --> 00:26:11,619
Come on, Jade.

373
00:26:11,619 --> 00:26:12,619
You're fine.

374
00:26:12,619 --> 00:26:13,940
How is she?

375
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:16,230
We've retrieved the bullet, but she's lost a lot of blood.

376
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:18,230
So we're going to need some donations.

377
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:19,359
I can donate.

378
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:20,359
We have the same blood type.

379
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:21,359
Oh, negative.

380
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:22,359
Good.

381
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:23,970
Go with me.

382
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:25,970
You're giving her your blood?

383
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:27,190
It's obvious.

384
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:31,059
You still love her for us, but I won't let you have her.

385
00:26:31,059 --> 00:26:44,809
You passed out while donating blood.

386
00:26:44,809 --> 00:26:46,809
The doctor wants you to rest.

387
00:26:46,809 --> 00:26:47,809
Where's Jade?

388
00:26:47,809 --> 00:26:48,809
She's fine.

389
00:26:48,809 --> 00:26:50,809
Why do you care so much?

390
00:26:50,809 --> 00:27:03,369
Because I need to find Jade.

391
00:27:03,369 --> 00:27:04,819
Here.

392
00:27:04,819 --> 00:27:07,289
Take another bite.

393
00:27:07,289 --> 00:27:09,289
You need all the nourishment you can get.

394
00:27:09,289 --> 00:27:15,289
She says good care.

395
00:27:15,289 --> 00:27:16,289
I'll do anything for you.

396
00:27:16,289 --> 00:27:26,309
I'm doing.

397
00:27:26,309 --> 00:27:27,309
See that?

398
00:27:27,309 --> 00:27:28,309
She's so ungrateful.

399
00:27:28,309 --> 00:27:29,309
You just saved her life.

400
00:27:29,309 --> 00:27:30,309
She doesn't care about you.

401
00:27:30,309 --> 00:27:31,309
She's so busy flirting.

402
00:27:31,309 --> 00:27:35,589
Don't think that I haven't noticed your little stunts.

403
00:27:35,589 --> 00:27:38,589
I am the one who makes the decisions on how to treat her.

404
00:27:38,589 --> 00:27:39,589
Not you.

405
00:27:39,589 --> 00:27:44,420
I'm the one who makes the decision on how to treat her.

406
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:45,420
Not you.

407
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:46,420
We clear?

408
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:52,720
And when we get back to the office, you can clear out your desk.

409
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,900
Don't make me say it again.

410
00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:10,200
Get over her.

411
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,200
Can I help you?

412
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,900
Oh, director.

413
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:13,900
I mean, Regina.

414
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:14,900
Oh.

415
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:15,900
Miss Spencer.

416
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:18,900
Mr. Morgan requests that you delegate your criminal.

417
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,900
Miss Spencer, you delegate your current projects.

418
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:24,319
If you could get those transferred by the end of the day, that'd be great.

419
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:26,569
Thank you.

420
00:28:26,569 --> 00:28:45,240
Mr. Smith.

421
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:48,240
I have those compromising videos of yours.

422
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,359
I'm willing to return them.

423
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:54,099
Under one condition.

424
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:55,099
Oh darling.

425
00:28:55,099 --> 00:28:58,099
I'll make you see how Jade sells herself for money.

426
00:28:58,099 --> 00:29:00,160
Let's see if you want her after that.

427
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:06,220
Great.

428
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:09,220
The contract for the grandpa project is officially signed.

429
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:11,220
My bonus comes next month.

430
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:18,380
I should finally be able to start paying Dexter back.

431
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:20,380
Hey, Dax.

432
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:25,380
I just wanted to confirm how much was my mom's medicine.

433
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:28,480
Jade, I've already told you not to worry about it.

434
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,799
I'm not worried.

435
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:34,660
I'm just curious.

436
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:37,799
A hundred grand.

437
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:38,799
Okay.

438
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:42,880
I'll be back in installments.

439
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:50,630
So, including previous expenses, I still owe him.

440
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:57,240
Almost a million.

441
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,240
What do you want?

442
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,240
You're to finish me off.

443
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,240
Don't be dramatic.

444
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:07,150
I wouldn't be here if I didn't need to be.

445
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:08,150
I'm resigning.

446
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:12,220
First told me to distribute my project to other employees so this one's yours.

447
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,220
Resaining.

448
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:16,220
I'm about to be the CEO's wife.

449
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:22,269
I have bigger responsibilities than working alongside commoners like yourself.

450
00:30:22,269 --> 00:30:28,269
Anyway, you have until the end of the month to get complete and if not, you don't get your year-end bonus.

451
00:30:28,269 --> 00:30:33,720
Of course, you can refuse the project altogether, but there may be additional consequences.

452
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:38,509
I'll get it started.

453
00:30:38,509 --> 00:30:43,329
Take care of yourself.

454
00:30:43,329 --> 00:30:44,329
Okay.

455
00:30:44,329 --> 00:30:54,430
I'm gonna completely ruin you.
