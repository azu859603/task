00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.129
Hey, Dexter. I'm in Florida.

2
00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:09.130
I wish I could have joined you.

3
00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:12.220
But unfortunately, then you've been here at the office.

4
00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.320
Take care of yourself, and call me if you need anything.

5
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.320
Okay. You too.

6
00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.730
Help! Help! Help!

7
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:30.440
Best out on the sidewalk?

8
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.750
No, he's not breathing.

9
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.039
I do know it's the power. Okay, okay, I'll take care of this until you're come here.

10
00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:39.100
Sand line.

11
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.679
Okay.

12
00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:47.679
Are you okay? Maybe you should go on the ambulance with them.

13
00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:53.259
I'm fine!

14
00:00:53.259 --> 00:01:06.420
He's awake. He's awake.

15
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.810
What are you doing here? Where's Jade?

16
00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.939
On a business trip.

17
00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:14.129
What are you talking about? She just got out of the hospital.

18
00:01:14.129 --> 00:01:16.129
She was really excited about the project I gave her.

19
00:01:16.129 --> 00:01:19.129
Probably because it came with such a huge bonus.

20
00:01:19.129 --> 00:01:21.260
You know how she is.

21
00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.319
I told her, stay and rest.

22
00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:25.319
Was she insisting? Where does she know?

23
00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:26.700
Chicago.

24
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.620
Good luck finding her there.
