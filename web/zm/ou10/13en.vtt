00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:08.990
Oh, here. Let me help you.

2
00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:16.460
I'm doing too much.

3
00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.960
Aren't you recovering from a recent injury?

4
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.460
How's that, Walter?

5
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.320
Much better, thank you.

6
00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:33.250
Young lady, you have an injury and you still went out of your way to help me.

7
00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.350
I don't know how to thank you enough.

8
00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.850
Don't worry about it. I'm just here to help.

9
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.039
You seem well-trained in first aid. Are you a doctor?

10
00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:46.219
Oh, no.

11
00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:49.219
My mother has been unwell for quite some time, so...

12
00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:52.250
I learned some basic first aid.

13
00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.920
She's lucky to have you.

14
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.649
Oh, thank goodness. You're okay.

15
00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:01.649
I came as soon as I could.

16
00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.649
Thank you for taking care of the man.

17
00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:07.420
Jade, I'm glad I could help.

18
00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.420
But I have to get to work now.

19
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.420
Am I leaving you in good hands?

20
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.019
Indeed. You go ahead. Don't let me keep you.

21
00:01:16.019 --> 00:01:21.480
What a nice girl.

22
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.700
If only my grandson could find someone so lovely.

23
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.959
Find out what you can about her.

24
00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:29.379
Yes, sir.

25
00:01:29.379 --> 00:01:32.379
You know what? Get me my phone.

26
00:01:32.379 --> 00:01:34.540
I'm going to give him a call.

27
00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:40.700
And why did she look so familiar?

28
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:52.430
Great, Dad.

29
00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.500
Bruce, good to hear your voice after my near-death experience.

30
00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.500
You really should come to visit more often.

31
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.500
What?
