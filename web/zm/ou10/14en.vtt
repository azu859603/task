00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:03.220
Take it slow.

2
00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:05.120
Yeah.

3
00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.120
Oh.

4
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.120
There you go.

5
00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:12.380
Granddad, I think you need a proper checkup.

6
00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.460
I mean, why are you back so soon?

7
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.699
It's just the heat is all.

8
00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:17.500
It's nothing serious.

9
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.300
Then why don't you call me all the way out here?

10
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.579
To discuss your wedding.

11
00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:27.739
I can't allow you to marry that vain and shallow girl you call a fiance.

12
00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:29.339
Regina is nothing but trouble.

13
00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:31.140
Granddad, what?

14
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.700
You think I'm too old to have a say in your life?

15
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.579
No, that's not what I'm saying.

16
00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:36.939
Do you disagree?

17
00:00:36.939 --> 00:00:42.109
Of course you don't, because you're smarter than that.

18
00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:44.259
Call off the wedding.

19
00:00:44.259 --> 00:00:46.850
Have someone I'd like to introduce you to.

20
00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.280
My savior, in fact.

21
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.990
Savior, the girl who rescued me.

22
00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:57.390
When I collapsed earlier, this young lady took charge and called an ambulance and brought

23
00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.159
me back to life.

24
00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:04.680
She's kind and smart and beautiful.

25
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.579
She would make a perfect daughter-in-law for her family.

26
00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:11.969
You should meet her.

27
00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:13.329
Granddad, I'm sorry.

28
00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:15.930
Are you defying me, boy?

29
00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.030
Grandpa, hey, just take it easy and sit back down.

30
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:39.120
Okay, I'll meet this girl.

31
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:45.109
These kids just need a little guidance.

32
00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:46.750
Hello, Jade.

33
00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.030
This is Walter, the silly old man you saved yesterday.

34
00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.629
How did you get this number?

35
00:01:51.629 --> 00:01:52.950
I got it from the hospital.

36
00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.109
That's not important though.

37
00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:55.109
Where are you now?

38
00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:57.629
I'm at the Lotus Hotel for a business meeting.

39
00:01:57.629 --> 00:01:59.670
I'm afraid I can't talk right now.

40
00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:00.670
I see.

41
00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.870
Well, I hope it's going well.

42
00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:09.099
Have a good day, dear.

43
00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:10.360
Lotus.

44
00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.879
Isn't that our hotel?

45
00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:12.879
Indeed.

46
00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:17.030
But I'm not seeing any meeting room reservations.

47
00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.740
Oh, Mr. Smith is staying there, however.

48
00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.020
That let's your old pervert.

49
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.949
She's in trouble.

50
00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:27.949
Call Bruce again.

51
00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:33.030
Tell him to go to the Lotus at once.
