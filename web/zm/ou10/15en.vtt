00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:04.450
Is everything in place?

2
00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:05.450
All set.

3
00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.449
If she dares to show her face, she won't escape.

4
00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:10.449
Excellent.

5
00:00:10.449 --> 00:00:13.509
You can keep your videos when it's done.

6
00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:15.509
That's the deal.

7
00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.820
Hello, Mr. Smith.

8
00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.170
My name is Jade Spencer.

9
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.730
I'm with the Morgan Group.

10
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.730
Um, pleasure to meet you.

11
00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.730
Pleasure is all mine.

12
00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:41.950
We have a seat.

13
00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.950
I put together a contract for our conversation.

14
00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:45.950
Take a look.

15
00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:52.659
I don't care about superficial words.

16
00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:55.659
I just want to know if you truly

17
00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:57.890
understand our product.

18
00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:04.109
Do we have a drink?

19
00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:10.579
Cheers.

20
00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:21.900
Have a little more.

21
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.040
Top it off.

22
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.219
I'm good.

23
00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:32.219
Not feeling so good.

24
00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:34.760
Can we continue this conversation

25
00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.760
simply with your team, okay?

26
00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.760
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what's the rush?

27
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.159
If you're not feeling well,

28
00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:45.159
you should have a seat.

29
00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:47.159
Stay for a little bit.

30
00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.829
I could take care of you.

31
00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.829
If you insist, then, um,

32
00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.829
we can play a game.

33
00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:55.829
A game?

34
00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:56.829
Like the sound of that.

35
00:01:56.829 --> 00:01:57.829
Yeah.

36
00:01:57.829 --> 00:01:59.829
So if you catch me,

37
00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:02.120
I'll spend the day.

38
00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.120
Good game.

39
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.120
That's good.

40
00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.120
And that case,

41
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.120
Mr. Smith,

42
00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.120
you have to give me a heads up, okay?

43
00:02:12.469 --> 00:02:15.099
Three.

44
00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:18.219
Two.

45
00:02:18.219 --> 00:02:19.219
One.

46
00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:21.879
Here I come.
