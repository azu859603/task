00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
Why not? I've made a public announcement. I can't go back on my word. I look like a fool.

2
00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.199
I'll take the blame for the cancellation. I promise. It's not going to affect the Morgan group.

3
00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:18.859
You and Bruce have crossed that line. Bruce isn't a playboy who starts things he can't finish.

4
00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:22.539
But it's just a one-night stand. It's not worth it.

5
00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.739
Bruce has always cared deeply for you. Granddad.

6
00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:38.030
So you really don't want to get married to me, right? I don't.

7
00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:53.439
Why don't we come today? You will officiate my marriage with Jay.

8
00:00:54.079 --> 00:01:02.429
What? Bruce? Do you remember what you said in the last day? I don't think I do.

9
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:11.069
Well, let me help you remember.
