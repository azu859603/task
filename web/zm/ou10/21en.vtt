00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:02.290
You're crazy

2
00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:07.610
You said to me last night that it's always been me and you that over all these years. It's just been about us

3
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.859
I was drunk. I don't think I meant it

4
00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:18.480
Drunk words are sober thoughts. So why do you keep pushing me away when I know you want the same thing that I do?

5
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.140
You're delusional. We're so over

6
00:00:25.969 --> 00:00:56.130
No, you can hate me all you want Bruce. I don't deserve your love anymore

7
00:00:56.609 --> 00:01:00.179
My past is my past and I can't turn back to him

8
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:06.019
Well, then I guess we have to do this the hard way

9
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:09.849
Liam

10
00:01:09.849 --> 00:01:14.739
Yes, I need you to acquire all of Dexter's assets stop
