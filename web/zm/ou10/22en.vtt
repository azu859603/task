00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
Dexter has nothing to do with this. You can't do that.

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.000
Well, then marry me.

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.769
Fine!

4
00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:08.019
Liam, stand down.

5
00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:13.419
I'm glad that you came to your senses.

6
00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:18.739
I can't torture each other anymore. You deserve to be happy.

7
00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:22.149
That's for me to decide. Not you.

8
00:00:22.149 --> 00:00:37.420
I need to know everything that happened to Jay while she was abroad. ASAP.

9
00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:46.399
It's been three days and she's already sleeping with him.

10
00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:57.030
Do this to me!

11
00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:06.180
Now remember, you are here to tow Dexter.

12
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.180
That you are cutting him off.

13
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.500
Or I will ruin his family.

14
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.500
Driss, please don't do that.

15
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.500
Why?

16
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.370
Are you feeling bad for him?

17
00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.370
What about all those times that you turned me down?

18
00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.780
Did you ever think about my feelings?

19
00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:24.780
Oh, you didn't.

20
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.340
Now you have ten minutes.

21
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:41.510
Do I mean nothing to you?

22
00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:42.510
So you saw.

23
00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.739
It's all over the news, Jade.

24
00:01:45.739 --> 00:01:48.739
I would have to be fucking blind not to see it.

25
00:01:48.739 --> 00:01:51.739
I leave you alone for three days and this is what happens?

26
00:01:51.739 --> 00:01:52.739
Dexter!

27
00:01:52.739 --> 00:01:55.739
I won't let you marry him.
