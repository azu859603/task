00:00:02.509 --> 00:00:03.810
You weren't mine.

2
00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.230
Time to calm down.

3
00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:11.230
I was drunk and being taken advantage of it.

4
00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.130
Bruce, he saved me.

5
00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:13.929
What?

6
00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:16.230
Dritcheen has let the whole thing happen, Bruce.

7
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.260
He was there for me. He cared.

8
00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.739
Okay, this case.

9
00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:23.739
Working pretend like this never happened.

10
00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:26.359
And you can come back to me.

11
00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:28.750
Take me back, Shane.

12
00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.760
Please, take me back.

13
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.210
Take a step?

14
00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.670
I tried to forget, but the fate took its course

15
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.579
and I found myself back to him.

16
00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.579
My heart belongs to Bruce.

17
00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:46.579
And I want to return your affection that I can

18
00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:49.700
because I have feelings for him.

19
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.700
I promise I'll pay you back everything I owe

20
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.119
but after that, I can't see each other again.

21
00:00:57.119 --> 00:01:16.500
You want to be harmless?

22
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:23.239
I'll show you how ruthless I can be.

23
00:01:23.239 --> 00:01:30.359
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

24
00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:36.409
These are the last tears that you'll shed for him.

25
00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:40.409
And your tears, your smiles, and your laughs

26
00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.079
are all going to be from me.

27
00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.739
Do you understand?
