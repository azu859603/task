1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Yeah, of course I'll serve.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I'll return.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,379
Oh, I'll let you get to work.

4
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:09,410
I'll go check and grab that.

5
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:11,890
What in the soul?

6
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:16,579
This would better be good.

7
00:00:16,579 --> 00:00:21,920
Sir, I found information on Mrs. J's overseas records.

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:22,920
Show me.

9
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,359
You better prepare yourself.

10
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:27,359
What do you mean?

11
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,359
We found a criminal record.

12
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:30,359
What?

13
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:36,000
Come in.

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:47,060
You look like you need to tell me something.

15
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:50,659
The hotel?

16
00:00:50,659 --> 00:00:55,100
You mentioned my college days with Bruce.

17
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,100
Did he tell you why we broke up?
