00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I had my assistant investigate your background.

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
He told me everything I need to know.

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.699
Well, in that case, you probably know how selfish of me it was to hurt him that way.

4
00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:16.059
Why are you pushing us to get married?

5
00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:21.140
I may be old, but I'm not senile.

6
00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.140
You're an ice girl.

7
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.070
How could you be vain?

8
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.070
There must have been a misunderstanding between you two.

9
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.320
Bruce never did get over you.

10
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.609
If you still have him in your heart, you can heal the past.

11
00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:41.609
I caused him so much pain.

12
00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:45.299
He would have been better without me.

13
00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:47.299
You're being too hard on yourself.

14
00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:58.100
This is?

15
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.100
This is a painting you did before graduating.

16
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.739
It was supposed to be a graduation gift.

17
00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:46.900
This is a studio.

18
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.900
He sits here alone some nights until the sun comes up.

19
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.700
Bruce never lets anyone touch this.

20
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.090
He stares at it obsessively.

21
00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:09.259
Miss him accomplished.

22
00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.580
This is my dream house.

23
00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.580
Really, it's a little bit...

24
00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.509
It's nice, and it has good taste.

25
00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:25.610
But it is a little bit pink, is it not?

26
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.610
I mean, can you imagine if people were seeing me walk out of this house?

27
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.610
Yep, I said it's your house.

28
00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:33.610
It's my dream house.

29
00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.610
What if we get married?

30
00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.150
Who said we're going to get married?

31
00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:44.360
If we get married, I'll take care of you.

32
00:02:44.360 --> 00:03:07.099
You remembered after all this time?

33
00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:12.620
He says he hates you, but as you can see, he can't bear to throw your stuff away.

34
00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.539
My life is such a mess.

35
00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:17.539
I don't deserve it.

36
00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:28.979
We deserve each other.

37
00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:30.979
Make a mess while you still can.

38
00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:38.990
Why are you crying?

39
00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:41.979
Because you're a fool.

40
00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:44.909
What looks like we're fools together?

41
00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:50.080
Why didn't you tell me about everything?

42
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.740
I'm like your mother's accident, your financial troubles.

43
00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:55.740
You go into jail.

44
00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:59.979
You know all that?

45
00:03:59.979 --> 00:04:05.780
I know about everything, and I know how hard these past couple years have been for you,

46
00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.469
and I'm a fool to have hated you.

47
00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:14.389
These are my problems, not yours.

48
00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:16.389
My feelings have laid bare into every piece,

49
00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:19.970
and you can honestly say that I have nothing to do with.

50
00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.670
I want you to live a happy life.

51
00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:27.439
You deserve something better than me.

52
00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:41.529
You.

53
00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:42.850
Oh my happiness.

54
00:04:42.850 --> 00:06:06.649
I'm just thinking if this is all just a dream,

55
00:06:06.649 --> 00:06:10.220
and if it will still be there in the morning when I wake up.

56
00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:13.980
It's not a dream.

57
00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:14.980
I'm here.

58
00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:19.639
All Jade is back.

59
00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:22.639
And she is here to stay.

60
00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:32.829
You should take that.

61
00:06:33.829 --> 00:06:39.310
Hello?

62
00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:44.740
Yeah, that's perfect.

63
00:06:44.740 --> 00:07:00.910
Okay, I'll be right there.

64
00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:04.029
So, what do you think?

65
00:07:04.029 --> 00:07:06.740
You remembered.

66
00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:08.860
Of course I did.

67
00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:10.339
Every detail.

68
00:07:10.339 --> 00:07:11.339
I saw you there.

69
00:07:11.339 --> 00:07:12.339
You totally warned thinking.

70
00:07:12.339 --> 00:07:16.730
I'm going to custom make it for her one day.

71
00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:21.860
Thank you for remembering.

72
00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:23.220
No.

73
00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:24.220
Go try it on.

74
00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:26.220
Okay.

75
00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:35.740
Mr. Bruce, there's something else I'm looking for you.

76
00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:38.740
They said it's urgent about your fiance.

77
00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:39.740
Okay.

78
00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:41.740
Yeah, this way.

79
00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:42.740
There.

80
00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:44.740
Just here.

81
00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:46.810
Well, what kind of person was he?

82
00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:48.810
He was your height.

83
00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:49.810
Well dressed.

84
00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:53.810
I'm just wearing a hat and a mask so I can see his face clearly.

85
00:07:53.810 --> 00:08:01.939
Hello, Jade.

86
00:08:01.939 --> 00:08:07.899
Ah!

87
00:08:07.899 --> 00:08:08.899
She's my mother.

88
00:08:08.899 --> 00:08:10.129
Nothing.

89
00:08:10.129 --> 00:08:12.129
She's in the safe place.

90
00:08:12.129 --> 00:08:14.949
Hello.

91
00:08:14.949 --> 00:08:17.170
What do you want from me?

92
00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:18.579
I want you to follow me.

93
00:08:18.579 --> 00:08:21.579
And if you do, everything's going to be okay.

94
00:08:21.579 --> 00:08:23.350
Dexter!

95
00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:24.350
Stop this!

96
00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:26.180
Dexter!

97
00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:28.600
Jade!

98
00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:34.980
Quick, get everyone out and follow that car.

99
00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:35.980
Let's go.

100
00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:38.940
Let's go.

101
00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:43.720
This is all I'm feeling so close tonight.

102
00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:46.720
And when it does, you and I are going to be together forever.

103
00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:53.940
Hello, me to this.

104
00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:54.940
You drove me to this.

105
00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:56.940
Please, please, let go of me.

106
00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:58.940
Let's have a conversation, please.

107
00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:02.940
I have been by your side for five years.

108
00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:06.220
Why do you love him and not me?

109
00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:09.049
You do to get your attention.

110
00:09:09.049 --> 00:09:12.360
I appreciate you so much.

111
00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:17.000
But love doesn't work that way, Dexter.

112
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.830
I don't know.

113
00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:24.830
I'm tired of hoping for you to love him.

114
00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:27.179
That's why I wrote my own ending.

115
00:09:27.179 --> 00:09:30.110
Our own ending.

116
00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:34.860
Are you okay?

117
00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:36.620
Yes.

118
00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:37.620
You just don't know him to give up, do you?

119
00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:44.539
Watch out!

120
00:09:44.539 --> 00:09:56.419
Go to hell.

121
00:09:56.419 --> 00:10:28.620
It's fine.

122
00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:35.059
Only awake?

123
00:10:35.059 --> 00:10:36.899
I'm so sorry.

124
00:10:36.899 --> 00:10:37.899
We're going to protect you.

125
00:10:37.899 --> 00:10:38.899
I'm just silly, child.

126
00:10:38.899 --> 00:10:39.960
You're confessing.

127
00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:42.429
You're not dead.

128
00:10:42.429 --> 00:10:50.830
We are both alive.

129
00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:53.470
Well, I wish it were a dream.

130
00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:57.470
I wake up in a hospital with you lying in a bed next to me.

131
00:10:57.470 --> 00:11:00.470
Do you have any idea how worried I have been?

132
00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:01.470
I'm so sorry.

133
00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:03.470
Don't you apologize, sweetheart.

134
00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:05.470
This is my fault.

135
00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:08.470
I left you alone to suffer for years.

136
00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:11.860
But this surgery, how did you?

137
00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:13.860
I was Bruce.

138
00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:20.620
He learned about ways, and he arranged for the best medical team to perform the procedure.

139
00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:22.620
With his help, I got better.

140
00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:26.659
And I escaped Dexter's influence.

141
00:11:26.659 --> 00:11:27.750
Bruce.

142
00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:31.149
Oh, God.

143
00:11:31.149 --> 00:11:33.149
Where's Bruce?

144
00:11:33.149 --> 00:11:40.019
Bruce was his life to push you out of the warehouse.

145
00:11:40.019 --> 00:11:42.019
He is seriously injured.

146
00:11:42.019 --> 00:11:43.019
Dexter died.

147
00:11:43.019 --> 00:11:48.720
And Bruce has been in a coma for three days now.

148
00:11:48.720 --> 00:12:02.080
Please wake up.

149
00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:04.879
We have a wedding to plan.

150
00:12:04.879 --> 00:12:07.490
You promised me a wedding.

151
00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:11.190
Jade, you've only just woken up.

152
00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:12.379
Rest for a while.

153
00:12:12.379 --> 00:12:13.379
I'll stay.

154
00:12:13.379 --> 00:12:16.250
I want to stay with him.

155
00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:19.250
Please let me stay.

156
00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:34.149
I'm so sorry I avoided feeling surreal.

157
00:12:34.149 --> 00:12:38.240
I thought leaving humans were going to be happy.

158
00:12:38.240 --> 00:13:07.000
I promise you, if you wake up, I'll never, ever, ever let go of your hand.

159
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.149
Bruce.

160
00:13:09.149 --> 00:13:13.289
Bruce.

161
00:13:13.289 --> 00:13:14.289
Hey.

162
00:13:14.289 --> 00:13:15.289
Hey.

163
00:13:15.289 --> 00:14:03.950
Let's get married.

164
00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:12.490
Bruce Morgan, do you take Jade Spencer to be your lawfully wedded wife until death due part?

165
00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:13.490
I do.

166
00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:19.850
You may now exchange your rings and the vows.

167
00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:25.710
Jade, I always thought avoiding my pain would make me forget.

168
00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:38.659
But I realized that all I truly wanted was to love you.

169
00:14:38.659 --> 00:14:46.059
And I vow to always stand by your side and to never let go of your hand.

170
00:14:46.059 --> 00:14:47.059
I love you.

171
00:14:47.059 --> 00:14:58.860
And I vow to always stand by your side and to never let go of your hand.

172
00:14:58.860 --> 00:14:59.860
I love you.

173
00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:05.120
Bruce.

174
00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:08.179
I underestimated your love for me.

175
00:15:08.179 --> 00:15:12.620
I underestimated my own words.

176
00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:15.340
I love you.

177
00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:20.570
And I vow to always hold your hand and never let go.

178
00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:33.700
You may now kiss the bride.
