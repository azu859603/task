Hi, I'm the hotel manager. I saw you struggling in the hallway, so I brought you back to your room.

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:19,260
Are you feeling okay? Okay. I'm gonna go now. Sorry. Okay, okay, okay.

3
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:28,359
You're kind of beautiful.

4
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:40,939
I think you've had too much to drink. I should go now.

5
00:00:40,939 --> 00:00:51,670
I take drugs. Henry has to do some.

6
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:58,670
Are you worried? No matter the cost, after today, I'm gonna be him as well. The CEO's pool.

7
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:00,670
Why would I need her? If I were worried.

8
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:04,469
Who cares if that past Sarah comes back?

9
00:01:04,469 --> 00:01:26,500
I manage his hotel and then I call the shots around here. You need yourself.
