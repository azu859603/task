00:00:09.779 --> 00:00:11.380
What are you doing?

2
00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.779
Getting your beauty best I see?

3
00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:14.779
Are you kidding me?

4
00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:18.199
Is this how you're gonna warn your way back into the hotel?

5
00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:20.960
Which, you should know it wasn't my shit today.

6
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.800
Your precious daughter is supposed to be on duty

7
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.679
of her not mistaken.

8
00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:25.600
Oh, and I slept like a baby,

9
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.199
unlike you who seems they can't sleep

10
00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:29.199
unless they're sharing a bed with someone else's husband.

11
00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:31.120
Well, you're a little brat, you know that?

12
00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.240
Keep flapping those lips,

13
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.640
because in a bit of a month or so,

14
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.039
you'll be singing a different tune.

15
00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:37.479
Oh, right, so it's the bed hopping nanny.

16
00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:38.640
Oh, nice, nice.

17
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.759
You're just such a little brat.

18
00:00:39.759 --> 00:00:40.600
You know what, Sarah?

19
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.479
If I were you, I'd stay in school.

20
00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:43.640
That's the only way you're gonna get

21
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:44.759
any white family support.

22
00:00:44.759 --> 00:00:45.600
Support?

23
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.359
You mean my mother's property, my support?

24
00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:49.920
Your mother's hotel?

25
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.359
Oh, my God, you know it's in bankruptcy

26
00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:54.320
after the reconstruction?

27
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.359
Nobody's gonna want anything to do with you

28
00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:58.240
or your short-term mother.

29
00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.189
Mom, how many are we?

30
00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:04.709
You better wise enough and get out of the white family's hair.

31
00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:05.549
Otherwise, you're gonna lose

32
00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.609
a lot more than face when you're kicked out.

33
00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:10.810
Come here, everybody.

34
00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.629
Mom?

35
00:01:13.629 --> 00:01:14.870
I don't know what it is.

36
00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:21.680
Okay?

37
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.840
Mom, we have to fail.

38
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:24.680
What?
