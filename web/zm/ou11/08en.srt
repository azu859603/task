1
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:06,019
That bitch never endures your phone.

2
00:00:06,019 --> 00:00:08,019
Well, she probably won't show up again.

3
00:00:08,019 --> 00:00:21,469
Still trying to save the hotel?

4
00:00:21,469 --> 00:00:23,469
It's none of your business.

5
00:00:23,469 --> 00:00:24,469
Well, I'm just worried about you.

6
00:00:24,469 --> 00:00:27,469
I mean, you've seen the financial situation of the hotel.

7
00:00:27,469 --> 00:00:29,469
Bankruptcy is just a matter of time.

8
00:00:29,469 --> 00:00:31,469
I won't ever let the hotel go bankrupt, Emily.

9
00:00:31,469 --> 00:00:32,469
Oh, really?

10
00:00:32,469 --> 00:00:35,570
It's just a matter of time before the hotel will change its name.

11
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:39,570
I wonder what my mom will rename it to.

12
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:48,259
You know what? You just keep trying your best.

13
00:00:48,259 --> 00:00:51,549
I cannot wait to see you get kicked out of here.

14
00:00:51,549 --> 00:01:01,229
Mm-hmm.

15
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:04,230
Looks like we'll have to secure partnership with the Wilson group after all.

16
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:16,750
Long time, let's see.

17
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:19,709
What are you doing here?

18
00:01:19,709 --> 00:01:22,409
You clean up nice.

19
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:23,409
It smells familiar?

20
00:01:23,409 --> 00:01:25,409
Hey, what are you doing at the Wilson group?

21
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:27,409
Did you see you ascend you here?

22
00:01:27,409 --> 00:01:28,730
God!

23
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:30,730
Sending an escort this early in the morning.

24
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:33,730
You must have, like, a thing for male escorts or something.

25
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:34,730
Maybe, like, a fetish.

26
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:35,730
Escorts?

27
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:36,730
A fetish?

28
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:37,730
Yeah.

29
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:39,859
Is this how you plan on getting my attention off?

30
00:01:39,859 --> 00:01:40,859
What?

31
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:46,280
What is it with escorts these days, God?

32
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,280
Do they not recognize a client?

33
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,280
The one who's got her.

34
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,400
Ooh.

35
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,400
Wait.

36
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,400
Is that the CEO, Mr. Wilson?

37
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,400
Yes, of course. What do you mean?
