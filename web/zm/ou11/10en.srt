1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Mr. Wilson, here is the arrangements for the press conference venue.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Who are you?

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Hi, I'm Sarah White. I am the manager at White Hotel.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I heard you two talking about the venue and came in to see how I could help.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,559
Mr. Wilson, the arrangements for the venue are here.

6
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:22,559
You can check it out and see if anything needs changing.

7
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:27,230
Remember, you're just a manager here, so do your job.

8
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:29,230
I'm not as easy going as my grandfather.

9
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:31,230
If I hear that you've been talking to my grandfather,

10
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,229
this will not be the last time you hear from me.

11
00:00:33,229 --> 00:00:34,299
Get up.

12
00:00:34,299 --> 00:00:45,350
It's pretty clever of you.

13
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:48,149
Taking advantage like that.

14
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:52,210
Mr. Wilson, I'm so sorry. I didn't see her as a kid.

15
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:54,210
You get out of the room.

16
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:57,210
Mr. Wilson, I'm sorry I didn't mean to eavesdrop,

17
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,210
but it seemed like you urgently needed a venue,

18
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:02,210
and I can provide that venue, Mr. Wilson.

19
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:04,209
I promise you'll be very satisfied.

20
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:05,209
What are you doing?

21
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:07,209
Mr. Wilson, don't worry. I'll get her out of here.

22
00:01:07,209 --> 00:01:08,209
Leave.

23
00:01:08,209 --> 00:01:09,209
You heard him. Get out of here.

24
00:01:09,209 --> 00:01:10,209
I meant you.

25
00:01:10,209 --> 00:01:11,500
Me?

26
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:16,219
This woman, she...

27
00:01:16,219 --> 00:01:17,219
I said leave.

28
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:18,310
Okay.

29
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:26,670
You're determined, but too much determination can be annoying.

30
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,670
I'm sorry, Mr. Wilson, but it is very important to me,

31
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:31,670
and I had to take that approach.

32
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:33,739
Have we met before?

33
00:01:33,739 --> 00:01:39,629
Uh, sorry, I think I mistook you for a friend of mine earlier.

34
00:01:39,629 --> 00:01:42,590
You have friends that are our sports?

35
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:46,879
Yeah, a lot of different friends, actually.

36
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:47,879
Let's go.

37
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:52,049
Go where?

38
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:54,109
Cafe downstairs.

39
00:01:54,109 --> 00:01:57,109
Unless you'd like to talk business like old men.

40
00:01:57,109 --> 00:02:06,920
Mr. Wilson just left with that woman.

41
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,920
I can't believe that.

42
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,919
That's the first time he left with a stranger.

43
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,919
What's so special about her?

44
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:12,919
She thinks she gets to do with him?

45
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:14,919
With her looks? What a joke.

46
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:16,919
There's no way he could go for someone like that.

47
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:18,919
She's gonna get dumped.

48
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:28,389
From what I can tell, the situation at the hotel is not good.

49
00:02:28,389 --> 00:02:32,159
With your experience, I know you can go to greener pastures tomorrow.

50
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:36,699
Why stick around and potentially ruin your reputation?

51
00:02:36,699 --> 00:02:37,699
I can't leave.

52
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:41,090
The white hotel is founded by my mother.

53
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:42,789
I'm sorry.

54
00:02:42,789 --> 00:02:48,789
Mr. Wilson, I need to secure a partnership with your company for the sake of the hotel.

55
00:02:48,789 --> 00:02:52,789
You can trust me, okay? I will give the Wilson Group the best possible deal,

56
00:02:52,789 --> 00:02:55,789
and I will handle all of the activities.

57
00:02:55,789 --> 00:02:59,099
You show me your determination.

58
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:02,900
And the proposal is very well written.

59
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,900
The tech launches in three days. Can you make it?

60
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:08,770
You can count on me to our first deal.

61
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:10,500
To our first deal?

62
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,330
Not that our business is squared away.

63
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:16,330
Let's talk about our personal matters.

64
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:17,330
Huh?

65
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,969
We've cross-passed before.

66
00:03:19,969 --> 00:03:22,969
I noticed when you glanced at me, sometimes when you look at me in the eye,

67
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:27,060
there's a glimmer of concern. What's going on?

68
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:33,060
Mr. Wilson, about that day, I'm so sorry, I'm just really confused, I'm truly sorry.

69
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,599
Sis, what are you doing here?

70
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,599
You two? And raise my boyfriend.

71
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,599
Your boyfriend?

72
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,460
Henry's my boyfriend.

73
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,460
Your boyfriend?

74
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,460
You two are sisters?

75
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,460
Yeah, sisters.

76
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:49,460
Now she's more like my dad's love child.

77
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,680
Oh, Henry, please don't take it to heart.

78
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,680
Sarah has been off at boarding school for years and has not graded socializing

79
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,680
or being diplomatic in her speech.

80
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,680
Mr. Wilson, I wish you and your girlfriend a lifetime of happiness,

81
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,680
yeah, no need to dwell on what happened in the past.

82
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,680
What are you two talking about?

83
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,680
I'm gonna leave, but don't worry.

84
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,680
I will handle the press conference venue, okay?

85
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,269
How did you say you're my girlfriend?

86
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:18,269
Aren't we an item now?

87
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:21,269
Look, I'm sorry about what happened. Now make it right.

88
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:22,269
I can't make you my girlfriend.

89
00:04:22,269 --> 00:04:24,269
You promised to take care of me.

90
00:04:24,269 --> 00:04:27,269
Can't you imagine how thrilled I am? That someone won't leave me?

91
00:04:27,269 --> 00:04:31,269
Listen, I thought that my behavior towards you in the past month would make things pretty clear.

92
00:04:31,269 --> 00:04:36,269
What about you, Spill? Do you get off on this charade you're putting up?

93
00:04:36,269 --> 00:04:45,209
I just, I didn't want you to dunk me, okay? That's why I acted like that.

94
00:04:45,209 --> 00:04:50,209
Please, don't leave me Henry. Give me three months and if you don't like me by then,

95
00:04:50,209 --> 00:04:53,209
I won't bother you anymore.

96
00:04:53,209 --> 00:05:04,160
Fine by me. I'll give you anything you want. I don't know if I can love you.

97
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:13,829
Excuse me, can you please contact Waitstaff and tell them to deliver fresh flowers tomorrow?

98
00:05:13,829 --> 00:05:16,829
Hold it, hold it, stop. You, come with me.

99
00:05:16,829 --> 00:05:19,089
Jones, what are you doing?

100
00:05:19,089 --> 00:05:22,089
Sarah, we need manpower elsewhere. Dolores said we don't take on collaboration.

101
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:25,089
It's your problem now that you took on the collaboration with Mr. Wilson.

102
00:05:25,089 --> 00:05:30,089
Um, Jones, you've been working here for a decade, but deciding what to lose now?

103
00:05:30,089 --> 00:05:35,149
Sides, who cares about sides? All I know is the hotel's gonna be rebranded in a few months.

104
00:05:35,149 --> 00:05:40,149
Sarah, if you ever need help, come find me. I'll be sure to lend you a hand for all times sake, okay?

105
00:05:40,149 --> 00:05:45,149
Let's go. Sarah, what the hell? You think you could compete with the Wilson Partnership?

106
00:05:45,149 --> 00:05:49,149
Emily's the future Mrs. Wilson. You think you could compete with her? Let's go.

107
00:05:49,149 --> 00:06:04,279
Mom, you won't lose, okay?

108
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:16,160
We're here.

109
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:23,079
Okay, thanks. Yes, please just have the flowers delivered to the White Family Gate Hotel tomorrow.

110
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:24,079
Okay, yeah.

111
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:26,209
You've been pastoring me all day.

112
00:06:26,209 --> 00:06:46,050
Miss White, you're back so late. You've been set for a bit.

113
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:55,060
Can that bitch be you?

114
00:06:55,060 --> 00:07:19,810
Careful. Careful.

115
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:23,920
What are you doing here?

116
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:27,920
This conference is kind of a big deal for the Wilson group, so you're gonna combine and check it out.

117
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,490
You hear along?

118
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:38,569
Mr. Wilson.

119
00:07:38,569 --> 00:07:48,500
Hey, Sarah, manage to handle it all by yourself, huh?

120
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,500
Oh!

121
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,889
Too bad even if you do.

122
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:53,889
The hotel will have a new owner soon anyway.

123
00:07:53,889 --> 00:07:57,850
Mr. Wilson, what are you doing here?

124
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:59,850
I wouldn't want to miss the drama here, would I?

125
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:01,850
Misunderstanding, misunderstanding.

126
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:02,850
Pick it up and get out.

127
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:07,470
Yes, sorry.

128
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:10,470
Mr. Wilson, I'm really sorry you had to see that.

129
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:14,689
I've seen a lot of the sort of things since I took over.

130
00:08:14,689 --> 00:08:18,959
Just snapping pics of your purse, huh?

131
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:21,959
Meanwhile, Mr. Wilson's cozin' up with Sarah in the banquet hall.

132
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:24,019
What? What did you just say?

133
00:08:24,019 --> 00:08:27,870
What did you just say?

134
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:28,870
I saw it in my own eyes.

135
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,870
They're getting all cozy in the banquet hall.

136
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:31,870
Not here.

137
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:32,870
They'll be trouble if anyone sees us.

138
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,870
The hotel is already a done deal.

139
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:37,870
I don't care why you're trying to bother and cozy up to Henry on top of all that.

140
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:38,870
You don't understand.

141
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:41,870
This rundown please hesitating over a decade ago.

142
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,870
It's nothing compared to the Wilson group.

143
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:44,870
Fine. Suit yourself.

144
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:48,870
But don't come crying to me when Sarah steals the prize from under your nose.

145
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:49,870
She really do that conniving?

146
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:50,870
No.

147
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,870
I won't let her have Henry.

148
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:58,610
Quite impressive.

149
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:01,610
I didn't anticipate you managed the entire banquet hall by yourself.

150
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:05,610
Well, Mr. Wilson, I have to thank you for all your help.

151
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:08,149
Cheers to successful conference care.

152
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:11,590
Thank you for the good wishes.

153
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:14,940
Can that bitch be you?

154
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:18,940
Hello?

155
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:24,299
Hello, Miss speaking.

156
00:09:24,299 --> 00:09:30,139
Something wrong?

157
00:09:30,139 --> 00:09:32,139
No, just a wrong number.

158
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:36,840
Mr. Wilson, I can promise you you wholeheartedly have my support tomorrow.

159
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,379
I think you'll do well.

160
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:44,740
What's going on?

161
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:45,830
Nothing.

162
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:54,330
Mom, something's not right.

163
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:56,330
Sarah was the woman who suffered Henry.

164
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:57,330
What?

165
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:00,330
I tried calling a phone that was left and it was her.

166
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:04,330
You know, if you weren't fooling around with that Jones loser, this wouldn't happen.

167
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:05,330
I know.

168
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:06,330
But what do we do now?

169
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:10,320
If Sarah wins over Henry, we'll have nothing.

170
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,320
No rush.

171
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,320
If Sarah hasn't told Henry, she doesn't plan on telling Henry.

172
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,320
Make sure you stay as close to him as you can.

173
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,320
Sarah has never liked us.

174
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,320
Turn her into a home wrecker if she dares to reveal this.

175
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,320
Knowing Sarah, she'll keep this to herself.

176
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,320
Mom, you're so smart.

177
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,320
Remember, John.

178
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
When we want something, we get it.

179
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:46,100
Henry warned everyone not to do business with one screw group.

180
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:51,120
He still managed to secure a venue.

181
00:10:51,120 --> 00:11:19,419
Is there something I can help you with?

182
00:11:19,419 --> 00:11:21,419
Just got some water for the host?

183
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:23,419
Oh, I could do that for you.

184
00:11:23,419 --> 00:11:26,889
Yeah.

185
00:11:26,889 --> 00:11:29,720
Henry, anyone still blame it yourself?

186
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,720
I always a lead candidate for that position.

187
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,720
You chose to loop me all over me.

188
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,720
That's going to lead you back off.

189
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,929
Mr. Wilson, looking forward to our future collaboration.

190
00:11:41,929 --> 00:11:45,990
And rest assured, I'll ensure the best for the Wilson group.

191
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:46,990
I've seen your capabilities.

192
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:53,179
I trust you won't disappoint me.

193
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:56,179
Mr. Are you involved with Henry?

194
00:11:56,179 --> 00:12:00,179
Uh, you're mistaken. We were just discussing work.

195
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:02,179
Well, that's good after all.

196
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:04,179
Henry is my boyfriend.

197
00:12:04,179 --> 00:12:06,950
When am I your boyfriend?

198
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:08,950
Mr. Henry, something's happened.

199
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:13,789
What happened?

200
00:12:13,789 --> 00:12:14,789
I don't know.

201
00:12:14,789 --> 00:12:17,789
He said he had bad stomach pain and needed to use the restroom.

202
00:12:17,789 --> 00:12:20,789
And then halfway there, he collapsed and started foaming at the mouth.

203
00:12:20,789 --> 00:12:21,789
Okay, did you call 911?

204
00:12:21,789 --> 00:12:22,789
I already did.

205
00:12:22,789 --> 00:12:23,789
Does anyone else smell bleach?

206
00:12:23,789 --> 00:12:25,789
Leach, I just gave him a glass of water.

207
00:12:25,789 --> 00:12:26,789
How could it be bleach?

208
00:12:26,789 --> 00:12:27,789
Oh, my God.

209
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:28,789
What is happening here?

210
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:30,789
Mr. Wilson, we literally have to conference in 10 minutes.

211
00:12:30,789 --> 00:12:32,789
What are we going to do about this whole situation?

212
00:12:32,789 --> 00:12:33,789
Jess, I don't know.

213
00:12:33,789 --> 00:12:35,789
They're saying the host drank bleach, but I just gave him water.

214
00:12:35,789 --> 00:12:37,789
The host will struggle enough this.

215
00:12:37,789 --> 00:12:39,690
Enough.

216
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:40,690
Get in with the hospital.

217
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:41,690
Make sure he's okay immediately.

218
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:44,870
Jason, check her to the lounge.

219
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:46,870
Mr. Wilson, let me handle this.

220
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:49,870
Okay, this is obviously due to the hotel's negligence.

221
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:50,870
You?

222
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,000
Mr. Wilson, please.

223
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Okay, I studied this in hotel management.

224
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,799
All right.

225
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:58,279
I'll leave you to it, okay?

226
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:03,779
Mr. Wilson, I heard something happening to the host of the event.

227
00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:05,779
You just taken over the range of Wilson Group,

228
00:13:05,779 --> 00:13:08,779
and you're already messing up the most important press conference.

229
00:13:08,779 --> 00:13:10,779
You might be facing it peacefully by the board.

230
00:13:10,779 --> 00:13:13,509
How'd you hear about the host?

231
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:16,700
I just already know.

232
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,700
You should be worrying about how to handle this.

233
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,700
Oh, I'm prepared.

234
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:33,860
On to today's press conference.

235
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:36,860
It is my honor to introduce the theme for today's event.

236
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:39,960
Henry, where did you find this beautiful host?

237
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:44,710
This host is amazing.

238
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:46,710
She's beautiful and well-spoken.

239
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:48,710
She represents Wilson Group well.

240
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:49,710
Yeah, she's impressive.

241
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:53,710
I didn't think Wilson Group was going to reach new heights under Henry's rule.

242
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:55,710
Hopefully that means my money for us, right?

243
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:56,710
Yes.

244
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:00,710
The Wilson Group will continue to thrive in renewable energy.

245
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:01,710
Thank you, everyone.

246
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:12,190
You look stunning.

247
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:14,279
You do it, Mom.

248
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:15,279
Let's do this on over here.

249
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:27,809
Send out the pictures I gave to you.

250
00:14:27,809 --> 00:14:32,139
Max, where are you off to?

251
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:36,929
Max, where are you off to?

252
00:14:36,929 --> 00:14:38,929
Henry, I have submerged your matter at home immediately now.

253
00:14:38,929 --> 00:14:39,929
Hold tight.

254
00:14:39,929 --> 00:14:40,929
Police want to ask you a couple questions.

255
00:14:40,929 --> 00:14:41,929
What police?

256
00:14:41,929 --> 00:14:42,929
You can't accuse me.

257
00:14:42,929 --> 00:14:45,929
The host being poisoned had nothing to do with me.

258
00:14:45,929 --> 00:14:48,629
I didn't say anything about poison.

259
00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:51,629
Yeah, kind of sound like you just confessed right there.

260
00:14:51,629 --> 00:14:53,629
Henry, it's best you let me go.

261
00:14:53,629 --> 00:14:55,629
This won't be good for you if this escalates.

262
00:14:55,629 --> 00:14:56,629
Max, you mixed bleach with water.

263
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:58,629
Did you not think anyone would get hurt?

264
00:14:58,629 --> 00:15:00,629
What on earth are you talking about?

265
00:15:00,629 --> 00:15:01,629
Bleach?

266
00:15:01,629 --> 00:15:03,629
Oh, I get it.

267
00:15:03,629 --> 00:15:06,629
You're trying to turn this on around me so you could secure Wilson Group.

268
00:15:06,629 --> 00:15:11,990
You think you're going to get away with this?

269
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:16,019
I don't know what you're talking about, but I got to go home.

270
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:18,080
Oh, not so fast.

271
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,080
You were saying something about no evidence?

272
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:26,059
The glass is still bare, Max.

273
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:28,059
Why not have the police inspected?

274
00:15:28,059 --> 00:15:30,220
You're despicable.

275
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,220
These are responsible for the bleach.

276
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,220
You okay?

277
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:39,340
Yeah.

278
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:40,399
Henry, our photos have been leaked.

279
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:55,029
What are we going to do?

280
00:15:55,029 --> 00:15:56,029
The reporters will be here any minute.

281
00:15:56,029 --> 00:15:59,919
You played your role perfectly.

282
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:02,110
You don't think I know who leaked the photos?

283
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:04,110
I don't know what you're talking about.

284
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:05,110
Stay away from me.

285
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:07,110
I don't want to see you again.

286
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:08,110
What are you thinking?

287
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:10,110
You don't belong with Henry.

288
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:11,110
I didn't edit tonight.

289
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:13,110
I should go to the hospital tomorrow.

290
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:15,110
Man, you're over a month.

291
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:26,360
I'm going to go to the hospital tomorrow.

292
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:31,690
I'm going to go to the hospital tomorrow.

293
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:34,039
I should go to the hospital tomorrow.

294
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:49,190
Man, you're over a month pregnant.

295
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:51,190
You know, during the early stages of pregnancy,

296
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:54,190
you shouldn't engage in any vigorous activities.

297
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:58,299
Nint, pregnant.

298
00:16:58,299 --> 00:17:03,370
Sarah?

299
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:05,140
Dylan?

300
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:07,029
Oh, my God.

301
00:17:07,029 --> 00:17:08,029
Oh, my God.

302
00:17:08,029 --> 00:17:12,329
Oh, my God.

303
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:16,730
It's been a while.

304
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:17,730
Oh, wait.

305
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:19,730
Why don't you tell me you were back in the country?

306
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:23,730
No, I just got back and just haven't had the chance to find you.

307
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:24,730
What?

308
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:25,730
What is this?

309
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:28,730
Well, I'm going to attend a physician at this hospital now.

310
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:29,819
Wow.

311
00:17:29,819 --> 00:17:30,819
Are you okay?

312
00:17:30,819 --> 00:17:32,819
Why are you at the get a college department?

313
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:33,890
I'm fine.

314
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:34,890
It was just a checkup.

315
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:35,890
What are you doing tonight?

316
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:37,890
Can I treat you to dinner?

317
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:38,890
Sure.

318
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:39,890
I would love that.

319
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:43,059
Great.

320
00:17:43,059 --> 00:17:46,059
Mr. Wilson, the online news and photos have been taken down.

321
00:17:46,059 --> 00:17:50,059
Also, the venue fee for the White Hotel has not been paid yet.

322
00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:55,839
Sarah has not come to sign.

323
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:57,839
She's not even proactive about collecting money.

324
00:17:57,839 --> 00:17:59,220
The fee can wait.

325
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,220
I'll sign it myself.

326
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,220
Okay.

327
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:11,420
What's there?

328
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,420
Come find me.

329
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:16,420
Do you remember when we were kids and you used to just follow me around everywhere?

330
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,420
I know.

331
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,420
I remember.

332
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:20,420
This has just been your shadow, huh?

333
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:21,420
Yeah.

334
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:25,420
And now that shadow, it's just grown up so much.

335
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:27,309
Remember?

336
00:18:27,309 --> 00:18:28,309
Okay.

337
00:18:28,309 --> 00:18:29,539
Yes.

338
00:18:29,539 --> 00:18:30,539
Uh-huh.

339
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:39,730
You really grew into a man who knows how to take care of a woman.

340
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:40,730
Mm.

341
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:41,730
Confidence.

342
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:42,789
Thank you.

343
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:54,460
Well, I had to finally grow up.

344
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,940
What's wrong?

345
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:56,940
Nothing.

346
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:04,150
Still, you know, you've really been through a lot these past few years.

347
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:05,150
Haven't you?

348
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:06,150
Oh, yeah.

349
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:07,380
So have you.

350
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:11,380
I mean, I heard that from your mom passed away that your dad got married to your family's

351
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:12,380
maid.

352
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:19,079
Oh, remember when my parents and your mom were still around?

353
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:20,079
Mm-hmm.

354
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:22,079
And he once told them that you.

355
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:23,079
Yeah.

356
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:26,079
You wanted to be my bride.

357
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,079
Haha.

358
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:28,079
Well, yeah.

359
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:29,079
We were kids.

360
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:31,819
I mean, it was just, it was just okay.

361
00:19:31,819 --> 00:19:34,640
Right?

362
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,640
Well, Sarah, listen.

363
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,400
I haven't forgotten.

364
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:48,730
Dylan, right now, my only priority is saving my mom's hotel.

365
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:49,730
Okay.

366
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:54,730
I am just, I'm not in the place for anything romantic or-

367
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:55,730
Okay.

368
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:56,730
Okay.

369
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:57,730
Don't worry.

370
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,720
I understand.

371
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:03,019
I'll wait.

372
00:20:03,019 --> 00:20:04,019
I have to go.

373
00:20:04,019 --> 00:20:05,019
Hey, let me walk with you.

374
00:20:05,019 --> 00:20:06,019
No.

375
00:20:06,019 --> 00:20:08,019
It's, it's no need.

376
00:20:08,019 --> 00:20:12,150
Dylan, you really deserve someone who truly loves you.

377
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:19,579
Why are you, Sarah?

378
00:20:19,579 --> 00:20:29,740
Hey, Sarah.

379
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:30,740
Hi, Anna.

380
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:34,740
I'm here to pick up the signatures from the bills for Mr. Wilson.

381
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,740
Mr. Wilson told me you can go straight in.

382
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:42,789
Thanks.

383
00:20:42,789 --> 00:20:43,789
Hey, did you trip yourself?

384
00:20:43,789 --> 00:20:45,789
Maybe you should go home and lie down, sweetie.

385
00:20:45,789 --> 00:21:01,099
Who told Mr. Wilson?

386
00:21:01,099 --> 00:21:02,420
Bitch!

387
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,420
Mr. Wilson, she hit me.

388
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:09,349
Sorry for hitting you, but some people deserve it.

389
00:21:09,349 --> 00:21:18,450
Come in.

390
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:21,450
Mr. Wilson, you don't need to sign these papers yourself, do you?

391
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:23,960
You can just leave it to one of your employees.

392
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,960
What, are you just going to use me then and discard me?

393
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,960
No.

394
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,960
How could I?

395
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,150
No, I just don't want to get too close to you and upset your girlfriend.

396
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:34,150
I don't have a girlfriend.

397
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:40,150
Right, right, because the media exposed that the scandalous photos of the CEO Wilson were fake.

398
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:41,150
You jealous?

399
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:42,309
No.

400
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,880
Justin, we're going to need your access card back.

401
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,880
Right, what's happening?

402
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,880
It's a direct order for Mr. Wilson.

403
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,710
Mr. Wilson's not going to find me.

404
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:01,710
Yes, he would.

405
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:04,710
Now you're going to leave on your own, or do we need to take action?

406
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:10,470
Oh, look whose job just flew out the window.

407
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:14,630
You know, maybe you should go home and lie down.

408
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:31,970
Sarah, are you seeing Henry again?

409
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:32,970
What's this?

410
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:39,480
Sarah is pregnant?

411
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:45,140
Sarah is pregnant?

412
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:48,869
That child must be Henry's.

413
00:22:48,869 --> 00:22:57,940
Emily.

414
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:00,069
What are you up to?

415
00:23:00,069 --> 00:23:02,069
You look like you just committed a crime.

416
00:23:02,069 --> 00:23:04,069
Sarah, I'm warning you.

417
00:23:04,069 --> 00:23:06,069
Stay away from Henry.

418
00:23:06,069 --> 00:23:07,069
He's mine.

419
00:23:07,069 --> 00:23:13,170
You know, last time I heard, Henry doesn't have a girlfriend.

420
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:21,059
Mom, Sarah's pregnant.

421
00:23:21,059 --> 00:23:23,309
Sarah's pregnant?

422
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,559
Thinking letting those photos out.

423
00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:30,559
Now we've lost all communication with Henry.

424
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:34,559
I was scared that Henry would find out Sarah was the girl who slept with him.

425
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:35,559
Oh.

426
00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:38,559
Now that she's pregnant, the will isn't a fact.

427
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:39,559
Oh.

428
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:46,089
Didn't you say that the mammoth group wants to partner with us?

429
00:23:46,089 --> 00:23:49,089
Uh, yes, the CEO said he would.

430
00:23:49,089 --> 00:23:53,089
And he likes women, and no one comes away unscathed.

431
00:23:53,089 --> 00:23:56,089
Mom, you're not suggesting that.

432
00:23:56,089 --> 00:24:01,089
I'm going to talk to Jones and have him sign up a meeting with the mammoth group.

433
00:24:01,089 --> 00:24:04,089
Sarah is pregnant, but she'll lose the baby.

434
00:24:04,089 --> 00:24:10,700
And if there's photos to prove it, all the better.

435
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,700
The mammoth group is a major client of our hotel.

436
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:15,700
You have to secure a partnership with them today.

437
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,700
Okay, I didn't know the mammoth group was a client of ours.

438
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:18,700
How would you know?

439
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,700
You're just a junior manager.

440
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,700
So naturally, you're not really aware of everything.

441
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:24,700
If you don't go, it's the hotel that will suck.

442
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,700
Not me.

443
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:38,880
You're doing a great job like Big Strong Manager, man.

444
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,880
Of course.

445
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:51,650
How else do you think I became a manager of this place?

446
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:52,650
Sarah.

447
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:53,650
What's she doing here?

448
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:57,460
We're the rooms in the back door.

449
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,750
The room's for private parties.

450
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:01,750
Two meets and clients needs, you know.

451
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,910
Some people just can't resist getting it on.

452
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:06,910
Really?

453
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:10,259
This woman is mine to play with all night.

454
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:12,259
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

455
00:25:12,259 --> 00:25:13,519
Great.

456
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:15,519
You guys know exactly what I want.

457
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:24,970
I'm Sarah White.

458
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:26,970
I'm the manager at the White Hotel.

459
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:27,970
Good.

460
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:28,970
Have a seat.

461
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:29,970
It's like a drink?

462
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:30,970
No, actually, I can't.

463
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:31,970
I'm pregnant.

464
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:32,970
Pregnant?

465
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:33,970
That's great.

466
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:34,970
I've never been with a pregnant woman.

467
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:54,369
Oh, my God!

468
00:25:54,369 --> 00:25:55,369
What the fuck?

469
00:25:55,369 --> 00:25:57,650
The real one where I was just about to do.

470
00:25:57,650 --> 00:25:58,650
I can't explain.

471
00:25:58,650 --> 00:25:59,650
She asked for it.

472
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:00,650
Ask for it.

473
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:01,650
You're a tall, ugly freak.

474
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:03,650
I would never ask for you.

475
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:05,650
You're ugly and your family's ugly.

476
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:08,059
Henry, I can't explain.

477
00:26:08,059 --> 00:26:10,059
I wouldn't have for doing anything that she didn't want.

478
00:26:10,059 --> 00:26:13,059
I received a phone call personally from the manager.

479
00:26:13,059 --> 00:26:18,059
The hotel manager called me and told me that she was going to accompany me for the night.

480
00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:19,059
What manager?

481
00:26:19,059 --> 00:26:20,059
Was it Jones?

482
00:26:20,059 --> 00:26:21,059
Go me!

483
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:22,059
Yes!

484
00:26:22,059 --> 00:26:23,059
Get out.

485
00:26:23,059 --> 00:26:24,990
Great.

486
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:26,470
I'll leave.

487
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:30,779
Do you know how foolish it was coming here alone?

488
00:26:30,779 --> 00:26:31,779
It's not your business.

489
00:26:31,779 --> 00:26:33,779
Do you know what would happen if I didn't show up?

490
00:26:33,779 --> 00:26:36,059
Why are you playing these games?

491
00:26:36,059 --> 00:26:37,900
I'm not.

492
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:45,460
I can't.

493
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:47,480
I'm pregnant.
