Joe, you have a lot of nerve.

2
00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.290
How dare you scheme against me?

3
00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:07.690
Dare to target me?

4
00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:09.449
Have you thought about how you'll die?

5
00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:11.250
Misunderstanding, misunderstanding.

6
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.529
Miswhite, I'm sorry for last night.

7
00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:17.910
There's all this bastard scheming against me.

8
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.629
But don't worry, I'll take him away

9
00:00:19.629 --> 00:00:21.070
and break his arms and his legs.

10
00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:22.989
No, please, I was wrong, I was wrong.

11
00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:26.030
Okay, one less piece of trash to deal with around here.

12
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.579
Dammit, how did Jones fail?

13
00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:34.780
Mom, it's okay.

14
00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.219
I already know this bastardly Sarah

15
00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:39.380
is proving to be luckier than we thought she was.

16
00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.100
So, what do we do?

17
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.299
It doesn't matter.

18
00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:44.579
As long as it doesn't come back to bite us,

19
00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:45.780
we have someone to blame.
