1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,879
Well, what should I do?

2
00:00:01,879 --> 00:00:04,799
How did I raise such a stupid daughter?

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,699
It's no wonder why you always lose to Sarah.

4
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:10,740
Jones has arranged the drug.

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,460
He's also taking the photos.

6
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,619
So our hands are clean.

7
00:00:14,619 --> 00:00:17,260
So do you want us to pin everything on Jones?

8
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:21,140
I mean, what if he does something about it?

9
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,219
Let him come back first.

10
00:00:23,219 --> 00:00:25,379
If not, then we go directly after him.

11
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:27,780
You know, I used to think that if Sarah could fly,

12
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:29,260
she couldn't save the hotel,

13
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:31,539
I have severely underestimated her.

14
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:34,420
And as for Sarah, I'll let her father handle her.

15
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:36,740
Because a father-daughter conflict in the White family,

16
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:47,759
she proved to be very interesting.

17
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:49,619
Sarah?

18
00:00:49,619 --> 00:00:54,060
Dylan, what are you doing here?

19
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,659
What is this?

20
00:00:55,659 --> 00:00:58,460
Well, I remember how much you used to love Rose as so.

21
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:01,509
Hey, but you know my situation now.

22
00:01:01,509 --> 00:01:02,390
I know, I know.

23
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:03,590
It's not what you think it is.

24
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:12,069
This is just a token of appreciation for a good old friend.

25
00:01:12,069 --> 00:01:14,189
Your boyfriend, I presume.
