1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,059
So who's a person just now?

2
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:07,059
It's just this business partner at our hotel.

3
00:00:07,059 --> 00:00:10,500
Yeah, she's okay.

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,359
Henry, why are we at this restaurant?

5
00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:16,359
We only have one table.

6
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:18,359
Would you mind sharing it with these couples?

7
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:20,550
This couple?

8
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,550
Sarah, should we meet?

9
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:24,550
No, let's say, let's eat.

10
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:33,280
So, you're the youngest of the master family, right?

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,700
And you grew up Sarah, what a shame.

12
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,820
You know, remember when your family went bankrupt?

13
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,820
Never thought I'd see you again.

14
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,820
Good memory of yours.

15
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:46,820
Well, then, you must also remember when you were just as simply

16
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:47,820
me as daughter.

17
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,820
You call me Sarah your sister.

18
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,820
We have dasities commendable.

19
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:53,820
Emily?

20
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,820
Don't blame me if I slap you later.

21
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:56,820
Sit.

22
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,649
Henry!

23
00:00:59,649 --> 00:01:01,649
Oof, you better take care of your companion tonight.

24
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:04,650
You might want to put Alicia on her so she doesn't bite.

25
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:07,030
Oh, she can't.

26
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:08,030
She's pregnant.

27
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:09,030
She's pregnant.
