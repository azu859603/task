1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
Sarah, you're pregnant.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:03,319
You're the father.

3
00:00:03,319 --> 00:00:05,599
OK, can you shut up, please?

4
00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:08,640
Mr. Wilson, just stay out of my business.

5
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:15,109
Dylan, I am so sorry that you had to suffer all of this tonight.

6
00:00:15,109 --> 00:00:15,789
It's all right.

7
00:00:15,789 --> 00:00:16,870
Don't worry.

8
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:18,429
I'm just up to see you again.

9
00:00:18,429 --> 00:00:21,120
And I know you want to get out of here.

10
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,079
Let's go.

11
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:24,940
Let's go.

12
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:29,710
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:31,910
So you knew Sarah was pregnant?

14
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:33,270
I'm not blind.

15
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:34,829
Let's see those two together.

16
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:36,070
Don't blame her.

17
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:38,469
I mean, she's known Dylan since she was a little child.

18
00:00:38,469 --> 00:00:41,229
I mean, it's only a matter of time before they'll get married.

19
00:00:41,229 --> 00:00:44,780
Enough, OK?

20
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:50,520
Later, give me off some wine, please.

21
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,399
It's OK.

22
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:53,380
I'm here for you.

23
00:00:53,380 --> 00:01:02,509
No.

24
00:01:02,509 --> 00:01:03,509
Sarah?

25
00:01:03,509 --> 00:01:04,109
Hey.

26
00:01:04,109 --> 00:01:06,609
Send me the father for your child.
