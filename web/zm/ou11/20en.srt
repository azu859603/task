1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,859
Good night.

2
00:00:03,859 --> 00:00:07,139
Sarah, are you really going to embrace a child on your own?

3
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:12,140
Dylan, I know this baby is going to come into the world in unconventional way,

4
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:15,140
but I still want to keep it.

5
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:18,140
It's not that easy being a single mother, you know?

6
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:20,269
I think it'll be okay.

7
00:00:20,269 --> 00:00:22,269
I mean, imagine I won't have a husband bossing me around.

8
00:00:22,269 --> 00:00:25,269
I mean, maybe we'll keep that back.

9
00:00:25,269 --> 00:00:30,460
When I have this child, remember to bring a gift as the child's godfather.

10
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:33,659
It's getting late. Get home safe.

11
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:36,100
Okay.

12
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,100
Take care of yourself.

13
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:38,100
Me too.

14
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:48,810
Sarah, don't just want to be the child's godfather.

15
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:57,299
First off, I want to welcome everyone to today's meeting with the board of the directors of the hotel.

16
00:00:57,299 --> 00:01:01,299
As you know, we've seen a downturn in business recently,

17
00:01:01,299 --> 00:01:04,299
and it's time that we consider the bankruptcy reorganization,

18
00:01:04,299 --> 00:01:07,299
and I want to get plans from each and every one of you

19
00:01:07,299 --> 00:01:11,299
before that bankruptcy reorganization, which is going to occur in two months.

20
00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:13,299
Why do we need to restructure?

21
00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:15,299
We just secure several partnerships.

22
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:17,299
I mean, haven't the numbers improved?

23
00:01:17,299 --> 00:01:19,299
We got in there talking about the business.

24
00:01:19,299 --> 00:01:22,299
We're lucky that we tell them to go bankrupt with you in the head.
