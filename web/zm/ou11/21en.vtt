00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200
You're going to nerve talking about the business?

2
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.219
Dad, you're back.

3
00:00:05.219 --> 00:00:07.820
She's my dear daughter.

4
00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:10.599
You miss daddy?

5
00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:11.599
What's with the attitude?

6
00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:12.800
You know, hello from me.

7
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.099
I'm your father, too.

8
00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.099
Mm.

9
00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:16.100
Father, right.

10
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.600
Yeah, I think the last time I saw you was what?

11
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.300
Three days after mom died when you brought Dolores home,

12
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.399
but I'm not mistaken.

13
00:00:22.399 --> 00:00:24.600
I'm surprised you're showing your face here again.

14
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.399
You disrespect her again, and I'm-

15
00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:27.500
All right.

16
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.699
Dad, let's discuss family matters at home.

17
00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:32.229
For now?

18
00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:33.229
We'll discuss business.

19
00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:36.229
The hotel's rebranding and restructuring has been confirmed,

20
00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:38.259
and nobody can change it.

21
00:00:38.259 --> 00:00:39.259
I object.

22
00:00:39.259 --> 00:00:43.259
I'm sorry, but I'm not just going to give up the hotel without a fight.

23
00:00:43.259 --> 00:00:45.259
Shut up.

24
00:00:45.259 --> 00:00:49.259
You think the hotel still is glorious as it was a dozen years ago?

25
00:00:49.259 --> 00:00:53.259
Based on the operating status, it is better to see refinancing and restructuring

26
00:00:53.259 --> 00:00:56.259
rather than delay and go bankrupt.

27
00:00:56.259 --> 00:00:58.259
Do you hear yourself?
