00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Richard, I suggest you look into your heart and see the real reason why you're doing this.

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Do you actually want to save the hotel? Or are you just saving it for yourself?

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Okay, I own 40% of the shares in this hotel.

4
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I don't agree with the restructuring. I don't think it's necessary.

5
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And I have a feeling someone's been tampering with the hotel's numbers.

6
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.379
Sarah, what are you talking about?

7
00:00:25.379 --> 00:00:28.739
Emily, what am I talking about?

8
00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:31.739
There's something you'd like to share with the group.

9
00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:37.780
Alright, we still need to get the other director's opinions.

10
00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.780
Alright, so let's take a vote. All those in favor? Bankruptcy reorganization taking place in two months?

11
00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:50.299
Please raise your hands.

12
00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:52.299
Are you serious?
