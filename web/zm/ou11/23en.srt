1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:05,849
Okay, seriously, none of you would have any of your jobs here if it wasn't for my mother's support.

2
00:00:05,849 --> 00:00:07,849
And now you're just gonna throw her under the bus?

3
00:00:07,849 --> 00:00:10,849
This way, you will also deal with facts.

4
00:00:10,849 --> 00:00:13,849
And the facts are that the hotel is losing money and intro.

5
00:00:13,849 --> 00:00:19,850
It's time to do your organization, get new financial growth into the system.

6
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:26,679
Okay, but we just secured a partnership with the Wilson group, so why do we need to restructure?

7
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:27,679
Anyone?

8
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:30,839
Okay, yes, so Dolores has really gotten into your heads.

9
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:31,839
Dolores, what about Emily?

10
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:36,420
If the worker heard help with Wilson gone so easily on you?

11
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,420
Sarah, I mean, Wilson, it's canceled our partnership.

12
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:42,149
It's not possible.

13
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:45,149
How could it not be possible?

14
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:49,149
You always talk about the Wilson group because you mention it every day.

15
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:52,149
The notice of cancellation was delivered directly to my desk.

16
00:00:52,149 --> 00:00:57,149
So without Wilson's cooperation, this whole partnership would not exist.

17
00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:02,210
I know you are reluctant to let go of your mother's hard work,

18
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:03,210
but we have to accept our faith.

19
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:05,209
You don't have to say so much.

20
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:06,209
Restructuring.

21
00:01:06,209 --> 00:01:08,269
I'm gonna join the meeting now.

22
00:01:08,269 --> 00:01:32,030
Sarah, no matter how hard you try, you'll never beat me.

23
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:33,030
Why are you here?

24
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:35,099
I'm here to see Mr. Wilson.

25
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:38,099
I'm sorry, Mr. Wilson, that he doesn't want to see.
