00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200
Did you and Mr. Wilson have a fight recently?

2
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.360
He's been very down and he specifically said he doesn't want to.

3
00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:06.799
No, no, I...

4
00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.490
Can you please just talk to him for me?

5
00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:11.490
Okay, I have something really important.

6
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:12.490
I need to tell him.

7
00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:14.490
Okay, I'll, I'll go ask for you.

8
00:00:18.469 --> 00:00:19.469
Mr. Wilson.

9
00:00:19.469 --> 00:00:21.469
There's a senior management meeting in an hour.

10
00:00:21.469 --> 00:00:23.390
Here are the materials.

11
00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:24.789
She'll leave her right here.

12
00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:25.989
I'll look at it later.

13
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:30.219
Mr. Wilson, Sarah White is waiting at the country entrance.

14
00:00:30.219 --> 00:00:32.420
She's saying she wants to see.

15
00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:41.439
You ask her to leave?

16
00:00:41.439 --> 00:00:42.439
Mr. Wilson.

17
00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:44.640
You sure you don't want to meet with Miss White?

18
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.229
Maybe she has something very important to discuss with you.

19
00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:52.030
She's very vulnerable right now.

20
00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.630
Her mother passed away when she was six and her dad remarried within a week.

21
00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.829
The White Hotel was founded by her mother.

22
00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.229
I hear the preparing for bankruptcy financing and restructuring.

23
00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:04.989
Miss White must not be happy.

24
00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:06.590
Bankruptcy restructuring?

25
00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.590
Yes, I hear she's looking for group partnerships to save the hotel.

26
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.590
But it seems that the internal staff doesn't want her to save the hotel.

27
00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.590
All those partnerships have been cancelled due to various issues.

28
00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.590
Mr. Wilson, something's wrong with Sarah.

29
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.590
She's fated.
