1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:05,219
Sarah, why don't you go home?

2
00:00:05,219 --> 00:00:07,719
Mr. Wilson said he doesn't want us to do, there's no use for you.

3
00:00:07,719 --> 00:00:10,220
No, no, I have to see him.

4
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:12,699
Well then, sit down.

5
00:00:12,699 --> 00:00:17,280
Here, drink some water, your face is so pale that something happened.

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,280
No, thank you.

7
00:00:24,379 --> 00:00:25,379
Sarah!

8
00:00:26,469 --> 00:00:33,159
Mr. Wilson, something's wrong with Sarah, she's fainted.

9
00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:34,159
Sarah.

10
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:35,259
Sarah.

11
00:00:35,259 --> 00:00:36,259
Sarah.

12
00:00:36,259 --> 00:00:37,259
She's bleeding.

13
00:00:37,259 --> 00:00:42,899
Okay, okay.

14
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:45,049
Sarah.

15
00:00:45,049 --> 00:00:47,049
Mr. Wilson, what about the meeting?

16
00:00:47,049 --> 00:01:06,219
Cancel it.

17
00:01:06,219 --> 00:01:08,349
Sarah, you're pregnant.

18
00:01:08,349 --> 00:01:10,180
It's a list.

19
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:11,180
Is the baby okay?
