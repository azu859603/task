1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,439
Wait, this will be you, okay?

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:03,279
It's fine. Just relax.

3
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:06,879
Henry, please don't cancel our partnership.

4
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:13,169
Sarah, was it not you who deliberately used me for the hotel?

5
00:00:13,169 --> 00:00:17,170
No, no, no, I promise. I didn't take advantage of you.

6
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:20,140
Sarah, I like you.

7
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:21,260
What?

8
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:24,620
No, no, that's not possible.

9
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,620
You want the partnership reinstated?

10
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:28,219
I want you to be my girlfriend.

11
00:00:28,219 --> 00:00:31,179
No, no, I'm not just gonna be the other woman

12
00:00:31,179 --> 00:00:33,500
and ruin someone else's relationship.

13
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,619
The other woman?

14
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:36,700
How are you the other woman when we're in relationships?

15
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,179
No, aren't you an Emily dating?

16
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:44,189
No, no, no, we're not.

17
00:00:44,189 --> 00:00:47,780
Okay, so then why do you keep going on dates with her?

18
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:52,340
The only reason I keep taking Emily out is because I don't want to see you with Dylan.

19
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:57,649
So why ask Emily out out of all people?

20
00:00:57,649 --> 00:01:00,780
I'm sympathetic for Emily. I am.

21
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,579
There wasn't my intention.

22
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:05,890
What do you mean?

23
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:07,650
I still may stay at the hotel.

24
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:12,560
I slept with Emily and I may have taken her virginity.

25
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,579
What?

26
00:01:14,579 --> 00:01:16,659
No, the white hotel.

27
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:24,980
I know you only stayed that one night and it was that day.

28
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:27,870
Henry, was it that day?

29
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:32,049
I was busy with the group and I had a drink.

30
00:01:32,049 --> 00:01:33,489
It's not what I wanted.

31
00:01:33,489 --> 00:01:34,930
Are you sure?

32
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:36,689
It was just the alcohol.

33
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:38,689
Whatever it was, the fact of the matter is

34
00:01:38,689 --> 00:01:39,810
I slept with Emily.

35
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:41,409
It was not my intention.

36
00:01:41,409 --> 00:01:47,260
Was Emily the one who told you she was the one you had a relationship with that night?

37
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:49,040
What?

38
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,480
Okay, I know what happened.

39
00:01:51,709 --> 00:01:54,430
You were drugged by Jones.

40
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:54,829
Jones?

41
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:59,379
Emily said she was threatened by a man named Jones.

42
00:01:59,379 --> 00:02:00,739
No, she lied to you.

43
00:02:00,739 --> 00:02:03,219
Emily and Jones have been in cahoots from the very beginning.

44
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:07,019
Who you actually had sex with that night was.

45
00:02:07,819 --> 00:02:09,659
Sir, how are you?

46
00:02:09,659 --> 00:02:12,060
I worry the nurse mentioned your name didn't expect it to be you.

47
00:02:13,229 --> 00:02:14,509
Why didn't you sell me fate?

48
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:15,949
Don't worry, I'm fine.

49
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,449
What is it, Dylan, huh?

50
00:02:18,449 --> 00:02:19,409
Dylan?

51
00:02:19,409 --> 00:02:21,729
It was Henry who brought me to the hospital.

52
00:02:22,289 --> 00:02:25,009
Last time you embarrassed you and now he's being so attentive.

53
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:27,819
Sorry.

54
00:02:27,819 --> 00:02:29,979
No, I should be apologizing to you.

55
00:02:29,979 --> 00:02:33,900
Listen, everything Emily says to you is a lie, okay?

56
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,099
Don't believe her.

57
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:36,860
It wasn't Emily you slept with that night.

58
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:41,889
Don't believe her.

59
00:02:41,889 --> 00:02:44,129
I think you should rest for now, okay?

60
00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:45,729
Let's not forget that you're pregnant.

61
00:02:45,729 --> 00:02:48,610
Mr. Wilson, I think it's for the best if you let her rest for now

62
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:50,289
and then you can talk about the matter later.

63
00:02:50,289 --> 00:02:50,849
What do you say?

64
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:52,909
He's right.

65
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:55,469
Get some rest.

66
00:02:55,469 --> 00:02:56,669
Discuss the partnership later.

67
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,340
I'm about to confess to Henry that he's the father of your child.

68
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:10,580
Yes.

69
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:16,860
I completely misunderstood him and put the blame all on him.

70
00:03:17,659 --> 00:03:18,379
We're gonna do now.

71
00:03:18,379 --> 00:03:19,419
Are you gonna confess to him?

72
00:03:20,259 --> 00:03:20,740
I don't know.

73
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:24,819
If I want to save the hotel, I have to secure a partnership with him

74
00:03:24,819 --> 00:03:27,060
but I don't want to ruin her relationship.

75
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,020
Don't tell him now.

76
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,860
Just for now, just to avoid conflict, okay?

77
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,599
That thing's settled for a little bit, okay?

78
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,319
And then you can decide whatever to do with the baby.

79
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,039
Yeah.

80
00:03:37,949 --> 00:03:39,469
Yeah, we'll do that for now.

81
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:42,050
Hey, I will take care of you, okay?

82
00:03:43,009 --> 00:03:44,530
I will take care of you and the baby.

83
00:03:46,129 --> 00:03:47,330
Thank you, Dylan.

84
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:48,610
It's okay.

85
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:49,729
You don't need to thank me.

86
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:53,009
I am the child's godfather after all, all right?

87
00:03:53,409 --> 00:03:56,909
You rest for now and I'll check out later.

88
00:03:56,909 --> 00:04:09,620
Forgive me, Sarah.

89
00:04:11,629 --> 00:04:13,229
You're not for all these years again.

90
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,439
I got my feelings for you.

91
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,019
You actually came back.

92
00:04:25,779 --> 00:04:27,860
I didn't think you cared about this family anymore.

93
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:32,100
Of course I came back to my mom's house.

94
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,600
I am surprised you were back.

95
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,439
I thought you were afraid of retribution and

96
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,680
wouldn't dare show your face again.

97
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,269
You still love me as your father?

98
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:48,180
Well, I think that love died for you

99
00:04:48,259 --> 00:04:49,459
right along with mom.

100
00:04:49,459 --> 00:04:52,819
Now you're just a devil in my dad's skin.

101
00:04:55,579 --> 00:04:57,339
What, did I say something wrong?

102
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:58,939
Well, you shipped me off to boarding school

103
00:04:58,939 --> 00:05:00,699
for over a decade for them.

104
00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:02,860
And now you want to talk about father-daughter love.

105
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:03,819
Richard, come here.

106
00:05:03,819 --> 00:05:05,259
Listen to what you said.

107
00:05:05,259 --> 00:05:07,259
Sarah, he still is your father.

108
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:10,220
Why don't we just sit down as a family and talk?

109
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,060
Dad, look at her.

110
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:17,759
Sarah, apologize to me.

111
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,839
Oh, what an amazing act.

112
00:05:21,009 --> 00:05:23,889
Richard, her mother passed away when she was you.

113
00:05:24,129 --> 00:05:25,649
She's difficult to discipline.

114
00:05:25,649 --> 00:05:27,170
She's impossible to control.

115
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:28,529
She's just like her mother.

116
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:29,250
No manners.

117
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:32,850
Don't you dare mention my mother, Richard.

118
00:05:33,649 --> 00:05:37,600
Who are you to talk about mom?

119
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,959
When mom was sick, you were the one who was fooling around

120
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:42,720
with the shameless slut.

121
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,839
He didn't even bring her home three days after mom died.

122
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:47,839
Your mother was very sick at the time.

123
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:49,519
She didn't have many days left.

124
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:52,079
Is it so wrong for me to see happiness elsewhere?

125
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,459
How dare you say that?

126
00:05:54,459 --> 00:05:58,139
We both know that mom got worse after you started seeing her.

127
00:05:59,889 --> 00:06:01,009
Let's not talk about the past.

128
00:06:01,009 --> 00:06:03,170
Yeah, yeah, let's not talk about the past.

129
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:04,529
Let's talk about now.

130
00:06:04,529 --> 00:06:06,370
And how you want to take the hotel.

131
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:07,649
How about that, huh?

132
00:06:07,649 --> 00:06:09,410
Are you man enough to talk about that?

133
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,649
The hotel is on the brink of bankruptcy.

134
00:06:12,449 --> 00:06:14,689
If we don't seek financing in reorganization,

135
00:06:14,689 --> 00:06:16,370
the hotel will close down.

136
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:18,050
I am saving the hotel.

137
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:19,329
Saving the hotel.

138
00:06:19,329 --> 00:06:21,889
Wow, yes, you make it sound so noble.

139
00:06:21,889 --> 00:06:23,889
No, you were just trying to rush to change the face

140
00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:26,610
of the hotel before the will sets it, right?

141
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:28,529
Oh my gosh, saving the hotel.

142
00:06:28,529 --> 00:06:30,610
You are even worse than I thought you were.

143
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:32,930
You were so afraid of me taking over the hotel,

144
00:06:33,569 --> 00:06:35,649
but you just had to tamper with mom's will.

145
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:37,569
Tamper with the will.

146
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:43,860
You know, it doesn't matter though,

147
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,779
how you treat me or what you do,

148
00:06:47,149 --> 00:06:48,990
because I'm already pregnant.

149
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:49,389
Pardon?

150
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:51,439
Who's child?

151
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,360
Who's child it is?

152
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,480
There's none of your business.

153
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,199
And by the way, I have already registered the child's affairs.

154
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,800
So if you try to interfere,

155
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:04,480
which I know you will, it won't work.

156
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,639
The will is already in effect.

157
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,129
So, let the best man or woman win.

158
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:19,730
What's the matter with the will?

159
00:07:20,689 --> 00:07:23,699
What's the matter with the will?

160
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:24,660
I don't know.

161
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:25,300
I don't know.

162
00:07:27,889 --> 00:07:29,089
Why did you hit her?

163
00:07:29,089 --> 00:07:30,209
It's my fault.

164
00:07:30,209 --> 00:07:31,810
It's my fault, okay?

165
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:33,329
Your daughter with her attitude,

166
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:35,490
it's like you don't care.

167
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,410
You're not going to be here sooner or later.

168
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:38,529
What can happen to you?

169
00:07:39,329 --> 00:07:43,089
Richard, we've been together for over 10 years.

170
00:07:43,089 --> 00:07:45,329
I've never asked for anything from you.

171
00:07:45,329 --> 00:07:47,810
All I want is a happy family.

172
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:50,290
I mean, I don't care if we live in a hotel or not,

173
00:07:50,769 --> 00:07:52,850
but I just don't want to be on the streets.

174
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:55,009
But you can't go tamper with the will.

175
00:07:55,009 --> 00:07:56,930
She's my daughter after all.

176
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:58,610
You treat her like a daughter,

177
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:00,769
but she doesn't treat you like a father.

178
00:08:00,769 --> 00:08:02,449
I mean, just look at her attitude.

179
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:04,370
Look at the fight you guys just had.

180
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:05,649
She couldn't admit to you

181
00:08:05,649 --> 00:08:07,250
whose baby she was carrying

182
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,649
because she wants to inherit from the will.

183
00:08:09,649 --> 00:08:11,649
You don't care about what happens to you.

184
00:08:11,649 --> 00:08:13,410
You don't care about what happens to me.

185
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,569
You don't care about what happens to Emily.

186
00:08:15,569 --> 00:08:17,490
I mean, if you're not going to do something,

187
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:18,930
I'm going to do something about it.

188
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:22,050
All right, the two of you settle this.

189
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:24,910
Just pretend that I don't know anything.

190
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,980
Sarah, do you get some time?

191
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:38,860
I want to take you somewhere.

192
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:41,649
Sure, let's go.

193
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:47,120
So how much do you make here?

194
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,039
Is it starting at 100 or higher?

195
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:59,519
Okay, I'm just thinking about a couple of things.

196
00:08:59,519 --> 00:08:59,919
What's wrong?

197
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:01,120
Nothing.

198
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:09,580
What's wrong?

199
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:10,980
Nothing.

200
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:11,379
Let's go.

201
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,100
How may I assist you?

202
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:14,659
Hey, how's it going?

203
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,899
Which area did they go to?

204
00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:20,179
This gentleman reserved a VIP lounge.

205
00:09:20,179 --> 00:09:22,100
He's going to propose to his girlfriend.

206
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:22,659
Propose?

207
00:09:24,259 --> 00:09:25,860
You mean the woman that just walked through here,

208
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:26,340
General?

209
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:26,659
Yes.

210
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:28,860
Let's go out of here.

211
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,769
I didn't see exactly what type of woman

212
00:09:32,769 --> 00:09:34,210
could picture my brother like that.

213
00:09:34,289 --> 00:09:35,409
Let's go, come on.

214
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:38,899
Now I see why you brought me here.

215
00:09:38,899 --> 00:09:40,980
Well, we used to come here all the time when we're kids.

216
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:41,460
Yeah.

217
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:41,940
Remember?

218
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:42,980
His friends are still open.

219
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,590
Sarah, I, uh...

220
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:53,330
What? Hello?

221
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:54,049
Is this he taking?

222
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:56,690
Mr. Wilson.

223
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:56,929
Hi.

224
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:00,049
I'm Matthew, but you can call me Matt.

225
00:10:00,049 --> 00:10:01,090
I'm Matthew.

226
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:01,889
I'm Sarah.

227
00:10:01,889 --> 00:10:03,809
You know, this is nice.

228
00:10:03,809 --> 00:10:05,409
I would never expect for a guy.

229
00:10:05,409 --> 00:10:08,610
So handsome to also be so romantic.

230
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:10,850
I mean to actually plan.

231
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:12,450
Hold this out like this, I mean.

232
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:15,090
That is truly stunning.

233
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:16,529
Hey, pal.

234
00:10:17,629 --> 00:10:18,830
Is there anything you want to tell me?

235
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:21,230
Oh, I mean, do you want to be a man

236
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:23,070
and actually have a fair fight?

237
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:26,129
Hey, pal.

238
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,759
Is there anything you want to tell me?

239
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:32,080
Oh, I mean, do you want to be a man

240
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,919
and actually have a fair fight?

241
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:35,440
Henry, what is your friend doing?

242
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,240
Sorry.

243
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:36,639
We'll go.

244
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:38,350
What do you have?

245
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:45,220
Okay, well, that was strange.

246
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:48,450
What's going on?

247
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:49,809
You're not even going to fight for her?

248
00:10:49,889 --> 00:10:50,450
There's no need.

249
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:53,870
If she likes them, she'll be with them.

250
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:56,259
Man, that's heartbreaking.

251
00:10:56,259 --> 00:10:57,539
What are you going to need to do?

252
00:10:58,980 --> 00:10:59,379
You know what?

253
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:00,960
Forget it.

254
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,019
I got you.

255
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:04,779
You want me to drunk tonight?

256
00:11:05,629 --> 00:11:05,950
Mm?

257
00:11:07,409 --> 00:11:08,610
You need me to be drunk tonight.

258
00:11:10,059 --> 00:11:10,779
Sarah?

259
00:11:10,779 --> 00:11:12,940
Yeah.

260
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,059
I love you, Sarah.

261
00:11:14,059 --> 00:11:17,230
I want to protect you and the child.

262
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:20,350
Will you marry me?

263
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:25,710
Will you marry me?

264
00:11:28,299 --> 00:11:29,740
Dylan, I have told you,

265
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:33,470
I don't see you like that.

266
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:34,509
I don't have.

267
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:36,029
Dylan's for you, eh?

268
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,549
I can't accept your proposal.

269
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:40,370
Can't you, Sarah?

270
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,700
I won't have ever thought about who's you and me.

271
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,419
I want to be here, your side, Sarah.

272
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:47,250
For the rest of our lives.

273
00:11:47,809 --> 00:11:53,409
Dylan, I see you as my family.

274
00:11:53,409 --> 00:11:54,450
I'm like a brother.

275
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,240
I'm sorry.

276
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:58,220
I'm sorry.

277
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:58,860
I have to go.

278
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:19,299
I can't say this.

279
00:12:19,299 --> 00:12:20,419
Want to hook up?

280
00:12:20,419 --> 00:12:29,009
Desert.

281
00:12:29,009 --> 00:12:29,970
Does tell?

282
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:42,450
You think you deserve, Sarah?

283
00:12:48,049 --> 00:12:49,409
You think you deserve, Sarah?

284
00:12:49,409 --> 00:12:50,450
You're fucking crazy!

285
00:12:50,929 --> 00:12:52,820
Listen to me.

286
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:55,059
If you plan on playing her, do not propose to her.

287
00:12:55,899 --> 00:12:56,779
Pose.

288
00:12:56,779 --> 00:12:57,659
You rejected me!

289
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,620
She's fucking rejected me!

290
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,179
You got it?

291
00:13:02,899 --> 00:13:03,779
Foxy, Henry.

292
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:09,649
You think you sent a chance because she rejected me?

293
00:13:09,649 --> 00:13:10,610
You were being delusional.

294
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:14,179
Sarah only loves the father of her child.

295
00:13:14,179 --> 00:13:17,330
I suggest to you, you better not embarrass yourself.

296
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:26,850
You don't really want to keep going after this girl, Sarah, do you?

297
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:28,690
I mean, she's already pregnant.

298
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:30,690
I'm into her, man.

299
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:31,409
I don't really care.

300
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:42,139
I didn't expect you to have such a hard time when she started dating again.

301
00:13:42,139 --> 00:13:42,620
That's right.

302
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,379
There's somewhere to go flowers for yums.

303
00:13:45,019 --> 00:13:45,740
For me?

304
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,100
Oh, no. I'm sorry. They're for Sarah.

305
00:13:47,659 --> 00:13:48,059
For me?

306
00:13:49,179 --> 00:13:49,500
Wow.

307
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,620
You got her flowers.

308
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:53,460
He's actually still waiting if you want to come along the team.

309
00:14:01,789 --> 00:14:02,269
Henry.

310
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:06,799
Impossible.

311
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:08,879
Those flowers definitely weren't sent by Henry.

312
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:12,820
These are for you.

313
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,220
These flowers are for me?

314
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:19,779
Yeah, but I'm sorry about my friend the other night.

315
00:14:19,779 --> 00:14:20,980
Well, thank you.

316
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,279
Is there something else you have to say?

317
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:27,600
Look, I know a lot's been going on.

318
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,460
I want to be with you.

319
00:14:33,019 --> 00:14:33,659
What?

320
00:14:33,659 --> 00:14:34,539
What?

321
00:14:34,539 --> 00:14:35,019
I am.

322
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:40,830
I have a lot of work that I need to do in Boston.

323
00:14:41,389 --> 00:14:44,669
And I actually need to leave soon.

324
00:14:44,669 --> 00:14:45,309
Right.

325
00:14:45,309 --> 00:14:45,549
So.

326
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:58,539
Why, I just Sarah always get everything.

327
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,340
Sarah, I don't just die.

328
00:15:01,899 --> 00:15:03,980
If you die, you won't be able to take away my things.

329
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,820
Yes, go die.

330
00:15:08,289 --> 00:15:09,809
Sarah, go to hell.

331
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,019
Go to hell.

332
00:15:17,019 --> 00:15:22,460
Marie, you really don't need to keep following me like this.

333
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,820
You haven't given me an answer yet.

334
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:26,539
Ooh, you shouldn't drive.

335
00:15:26,539 --> 00:15:27,580
It's not safe for the baby.

336
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:42,289
You think I'm good with me?

337
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:44,690
And you were just joking back there, right?

338
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:46,529
I mean, pursuing me.

339
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:48,929
Like, you wouldn't want to pursue someone who's actually pregnant.

340
00:15:50,129 --> 00:15:51,009
No, I wasn't kidding.

341
00:15:51,009 --> 00:15:52,850
I don't even care that you have a child.

342
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:54,450
I just, I just like you.

343
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:55,730
Well, watch out.

344
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:05,299
Henry, only wake up.

345
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:06,259
Henry, wake up.

346
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:22,419
Henry, do you wake up?

347
00:16:23,059 --> 00:16:24,259
Henry, you can't die yet.

348
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,879
I still have so many things I didn't tell you.

349
00:16:28,659 --> 00:16:34,289
Mom, please keep me safe.

350
00:16:34,289 --> 00:16:38,210
Henry, you asshole, you can't die yet.

351
00:16:39,149 --> 00:16:41,230
I still have so many things I need to tell you.

352
00:16:41,789 --> 00:16:42,429
I love you.

353
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:45,629
And you're the father of my child

354
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:47,789
and I want you to be in their life.

355
00:16:47,789 --> 00:16:49,789
And I want you to be in their life.

356
00:16:51,549 --> 00:16:53,149
Now, this is a woman.

357
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:55,779
Henry's a woman?

358
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:59,070
Henry, you're not.

359
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,920
What were you saying about me being a father?

360
00:17:15,299 --> 00:17:16,740
That's the thing is,

361
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,660
I didn't know Emily was pretending to mean me

362
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,900
and told you that she was the one she slept with.

363
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:25,680
But I won't pester you anymore.

364
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:30,029
And if you're not happy, I will just forget about it.

365
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,240
Were you taking my child?

366
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:51,890
Mommy's face.

367
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:53,170
She sure is a tomato.

368
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,099
You're right as a tomato.

369
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,339
Sarah, I'm happy.

370
00:17:59,549 --> 00:18:00,109
I love you.

371
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:03,069
I know I haven't properly proposed to you.

372
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,099
Well, not to let him do so.

373
00:18:06,509 --> 00:18:06,990
No.

374
00:18:07,859 --> 00:18:08,339
No.

375
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:10,430
You don't want to marry me?

376
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:14,539
No, it's just, I can't stop thinking about the car accident.

377
00:18:15,099 --> 00:18:17,980
I think Emily and her brood had something to do with it.

378
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:20,960
There's something strange about it.

379
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:22,559
I haven't investigated.

380
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:24,400
Well, the board meeting is next week.

381
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:27,549
I have a plan.

382
00:18:28,849 --> 00:18:30,049
Can you help me?

383
00:18:30,049 --> 00:18:31,789
Of course.

384
00:18:31,789 --> 00:18:33,470
Maybe a little reward would help.

385
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:34,349
Oh, really?

386
00:18:37,539 --> 00:18:40,660
Henry, you know, I really didn't take you to be the villain.

387
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:43,059
Just using me to secretly empty out the hotel.

388
00:18:43,059 --> 00:18:45,539
And what kind of person are you manipulating me like that?

389
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:47,779
I hope you know you have no relationship with me in the future.

390
00:18:47,779 --> 00:18:50,579
Oh, that's fine because I never want to see you again.

391
00:18:50,579 --> 00:18:58,500
What's going on with you and Henry?

392
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,500
Both you and Henry are despicable.

393
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,460
Yeah, you, the child of a mistress, just colluding with him,

394
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,460
to take our biggest business partner.

395
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:11,180
I didn't expect Sarah and Henry to break up.

396
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:14,000
Let's see you save your hotel now, Sarah.

397
00:19:20,589 --> 00:19:23,630
Sarah, I've already told the reporters to release the photos.

398
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:24,670
How about your aunt?

399
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:25,710
Emily fell for it.

400
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:27,710
The board meeting is the day after tomorrow.

401
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:29,950
And we can finally expose their true colors.

402
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:31,630
Oh, I have a surprise.

403
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:33,059
Dr. Jones don't.

404
00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:35,059
And he provided me some pretty interesting info.

405
00:19:36,019 --> 00:19:37,220
Well, that's great.

406
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:40,019
But in order to pull this off, we can't see each other.

407
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:42,160
I'll miss you.

408
00:19:42,859 --> 00:19:43,660
I'll miss you too.

409
00:19:51,539 --> 00:19:53,460
The white family's property is ours now.

410
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,420
Wait, what?

411
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,180
Henry and Sarah broke up.

412
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:57,220
Really?

413
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:59,660
Oh my God.

414
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:03,339
So the white family property is all ours now.

415
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:06,220
So that board meeting in three days will be such a success.

416
00:20:06,779 --> 00:20:13,140
Yes, you did.

417
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:18,750
The white hotel has been in operation for more than 20 years.

418
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,309
As a private entity, we have done very well.

419
00:20:21,309 --> 00:20:24,109
But recently, we have been operating in the red.

420
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:28,829
We are seeking refinancing and restructuring within a week.

421
00:20:29,549 --> 00:20:31,069
And it's okay to rebrand.

422
00:20:31,069 --> 00:20:32,829
They didn't have the hotel go under.

423
00:20:32,829 --> 00:20:34,430
Hm, he who goes with the wind.

424
00:20:35,809 --> 00:20:37,170
Oh, sorry.

425
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:38,690
Did I say something wrong?

426
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:43,170
I just remember over 10 years ago, you guys all begging my mom for a job.

427
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:44,930
And now, um, life.

428
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:48,690
You know, flatter Dolores and now you're a member of the board.

429
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:49,890
It's outrageous.

430
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:50,849
What do you mean?

431
00:20:52,099 --> 00:20:54,339
I've worked hard to get this position.

432
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:56,319
I've not been a browner.

433
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:57,599
Calling your brown loser?

434
00:20:57,599 --> 00:20:59,680
I've gotten this on my own abilities.

435
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,609
You know, Sarah, it's about restructuring.

436
00:21:02,609 --> 00:21:03,970
Don't stir up trouble.

437
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:04,849
Oh, sorry.

438
00:21:04,849 --> 00:21:06,369
Am I stirring up trouble?

439
00:21:06,369 --> 00:21:08,529
Haven't you already sensed my attitude?

440
00:21:08,529 --> 00:21:10,529
I clearly disagree with the reorganization.

441
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:12,779
Dolores?

442
00:21:12,779 --> 00:21:14,220
Don't think I don't know what you're up to.

443
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,339
I know what you're doing.

444
00:21:15,339 --> 00:21:17,660
You're doing this so my shares are invalid.

445
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:18,779
And then the will isn't valid.

446
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:20,460
And then you can take over the hotel.

447
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,259
Right?

448
00:21:21,259 --> 00:21:23,819
Sarah, how can you think that I would do that?

449
00:21:23,819 --> 00:21:25,339
You have already taken away my home.

450
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:28,539
I won't like to take over.

451
00:21:28,539 --> 00:21:29,660
What can you say?

452
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:31,740
You only have 40% of the shares.

453
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,420
Combined, we have all others.

454
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:36,900
What about me?

455
00:21:40,619 --> 00:21:41,180
What about me?

456
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:44,980
Henry, didn't you and Sarah break up?

457
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,140
See, I'm awfully happy about that.

458
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,940
I guess you can probably consider this the official announcement

459
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,299
of my relationship with my wife.

460
00:21:53,619 --> 00:21:57,059
Sarah, your scheming has gone deeper than I thought.

461
00:21:58,579 --> 00:21:59,619
Well, how about that?

462
00:21:59,619 --> 00:22:01,940
Mr. Wilson, this is a hotel board meeting.

463
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:04,740
Must I really ask you not to interfere?

464
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,779
As far as I'm concerned,

465
00:22:05,779 --> 00:22:07,220
neither you nor your daughter

466
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,740
have a single share in this company.

467
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:09,940
Who are these people?

468
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:10,980
Board members?

469
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:11,380
You.

470
00:22:12,339 --> 00:22:13,700
Mr. Wilson, you want to take charge of it.

471
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,980
I need you to listen to Sarah.

472
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,339
You have feelings for the hotel,

473
00:22:16,339 --> 00:22:18,900
but I need you to think about survival.

474
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,660
Otherwise, we will lose everything.

475
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,900
So let's reach a decision together

476
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:26,259
with a refinance and organized for the operation of the hotel.

477
00:22:26,819 --> 00:22:30,500
Of course, I can't bear to see this hotel go out of business.

478
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:31,859
Don't worry.

479
00:22:31,859 --> 00:22:33,299
This is where it gets fun.

480
00:22:33,299 --> 00:22:39,119
What do the rest of you think?

481
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:40,000
Mr. White,

482
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,599
there's an internal board meeting,

483
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:43,200
which means we have to leave.

484
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,240
My name is you.

485
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,079
This means they're no longer a part of the board.

486
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:51,970
How about a vote for the hotel not to change its cards?

487
00:22:52,609 --> 00:22:59,789
Mr. Wilson, this is an internal matter for them.

488
00:22:59,789 --> 00:23:01,470
Tell what do you want to do?

489
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:02,109
I do ask.

490
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,099
Have a look at that.

491
00:23:04,099 --> 00:23:05,940
I've acquired the shares from the board,

492
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,619
and I'm interested in them to my wife.

493
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,579
Thank you.

494
00:23:09,579 --> 00:23:09,980
Wow.

495
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:12,859
Well, now that I have hold of all of the shares,

496
00:23:12,859 --> 00:23:14,700
I hope you have no objections.

497
00:23:15,259 --> 00:23:17,549
Beautiful.

498
00:23:19,259 --> 00:23:22,319
Henry promised me compensation.

499
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,680
Don't get to share with him to me, please.

500
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,119
She wants to be compensated.

501
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:28,640
Look, you'll be accounted for.

502
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:29,839
Bring him in.

503
00:23:31,789 --> 00:23:32,829
It's not my business.

504
00:23:34,029 --> 00:23:34,750
It was all her.

505
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,589
It was Emily who asked me to drug you.

506
00:23:36,589 --> 00:23:37,710
And her, this bitch,

507
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:40,430
she's the one that made me make Miss White's life difficult.

508
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:42,190
Miss White, I was wrong.

509
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:43,150
Please forgive me.

510
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:44,589
Shut up, Henry.

511
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:46,190
Don't believe a word he says it.

512
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:47,869
It's not for this person.

513
00:23:47,869 --> 00:23:49,630
I recorded our time in bed that day.

514
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:52,349
I will kill you.

515
00:23:53,069 --> 00:23:54,690
Please.

516
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:56,049
Emily and do us white.

517
00:23:56,049 --> 00:23:57,970
Get on the russet, or come and murder.

518
00:24:13,089 --> 00:24:16,779
Sarah, you dad always knew you'd be successful.

519
00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:20,160
It's very sweet of you,

520
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,680
and I already told you.

521
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,480
My dad died right along with Mom.

522
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,200
Very easy.

523
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,799
I would forget I'm Bob.

524
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:30,559
You were my father until he brought galore silver

525
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,609
and while we know what happened.

526
00:24:32,609 --> 00:24:35,650
And I think that's when he stopped being my dad.

527
00:24:37,099 --> 00:24:37,660
You hear that?

528
00:24:39,089 --> 00:24:40,609
Look, the way I see it,

529
00:24:40,609 --> 00:24:41,730
you have a couple options.

530
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,089
You send the shares back.

531
00:24:43,089 --> 00:24:45,089
You sit on them, but just so you know,

532
00:24:45,089 --> 00:24:46,130
once I'm finished,

533
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:48,289
the shares in your possession will be useless.

534
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:54,210
So?

535
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:55,250
They'll sell.

536
00:24:55,250 --> 00:25:00,799
They'll sell.

537
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:07,390
How'd I do it, baby?

538
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:25,230
Amazing.

539
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:28,589
Henry, I'm sorry about the incident at the bar the other day.

540
00:25:28,589 --> 00:25:30,299
It's okay.

541
00:25:30,299 --> 00:25:32,619
I should thank you for helping me chase my wife.

542
00:25:32,619 --> 00:25:33,819
Pastor.

543
00:25:33,819 --> 00:25:37,809
Let me tell you this.

544
00:25:37,809 --> 00:25:38,930
You better be taking care of her.

545
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:42,079
I'm going to snatch my daughter and Sarah away from you.

546
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,460
Sarah, I always want you to be happy.

547
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:51,500
Thank you, Tom.

548
00:25:51,500 --> 00:26:03,200
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

549
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,880
You haven't even taken your vows yet.

550
00:26:06,529 --> 00:26:08,529
Young people so impatient.

551
00:26:08,529 --> 00:26:09,569
Okay, you're ready?

552
00:26:09,569 --> 00:26:11,009
Please repeat after me.

553
00:26:11,009 --> 00:26:13,490
We stand here today before all of you.

554
00:26:14,049 --> 00:26:16,369
We stand here today before all of you.

555
00:26:16,369 --> 00:26:19,009
To declare my love and willingness.

556
00:26:19,009 --> 00:26:21,490
To declare my love and willingness.

557
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:25,009
As we enter into this most holy matrimony.

558
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:28,049
As we enter into this most holy matrimony.

559
00:26:29,099 --> 00:26:30,940
Now you can kiss the bride.
