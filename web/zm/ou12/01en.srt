1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:13,060
Oh, tomorrow we're getting married.

2
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:18,179
As my ex's best friend, I assume you'd like to give us your blessing?

3
00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:27,980
I'll be one of the blessings I fly, it's just the treatment of seeing me do it after.

4
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:32,219
Janin, when did you become so shameless?

5
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:36,340
Did you really expect to feed off a rookie for your whole life?

6
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:41,439
Before I trusted you, it might be a misfortune.

7
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:47,439
You were the son of my father's chauffeur.

8
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:50,439
He was feeding off of him.

9
00:00:50,439 --> 00:00:54,439
Honey, how could you say something with that?

10
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:57,439
Your father has been dead for years.

11
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:01,439
Now before me, you were nothing but a loser.

12
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:03,439
About a drop out of college.

13
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:13,930
You're nothing but a daughter to a filthy rich den.

14
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:17,930
You promised you would marry me if I gave you the business.

15
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:20,540
Not her.

16
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:23,540
Please, I spent one period.

17
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,540
I said...
