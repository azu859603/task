1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,619
I say that's the Clark family business from you, you, you, you've just disgusting, spoiled,

2
00:00:11,619 --> 00:00:16,100
infected, rat, didn't even bother.

3
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:26,339
They tell me before the wedding, I, they, they, they, no, people, how many more excuses can you make?

4
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:34,689
Ricky, did you ever love me?

5
00:00:34,689 --> 00:00:37,979
What, how insulting?

6
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:45,500
How could I love someone who is such a nightmare every day of my life?

7
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:50,929
How could I love someone who can make me sick?

8
00:00:51,570 --> 00:01:09,120
You're at the end and all you care about is frecky love too.

9
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:17,730
What you should really be worrying about is how a drug-free virgin like you ended up like

10
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:26,319
since you're dying, I figured I'd let you in on a little sick. Someone was hired to inject you

11
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:33,019
with this disease. It's a price you didn't figure it out for yourself or jump off of a

12
00:01:33,019 --> 00:01:35,420
building to save the world when you're disgrace.

13
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:40,319
Do that, Ricky.

14
00:01:42,049 --> 00:01:51,409
It was Ricky. The love of your wife didn't believe you. 20 bucks to a drugie, he's free,

15
00:01:51,409 --> 00:01:59,540
and you're the dirty slut. He'd be even treatment? Well, that was my act. I wanted to watch you soon.

16
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:10,129
And he'd get to see past you.
