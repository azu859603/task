00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
Hey, you're not a doctor, okay? Let me call 911.

2
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:10.800
Do you want to eat? Do you want to eat? Is that before you?

3
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:14.269
It's just one.

4
00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:17.949
It's too late.

5
00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:20.269
I don't, don't say that.

6
00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.550
I'm spending, I'm so sorry. I should have been there.

7
00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.629
I thought I'd be serious that you were happy.

8
00:00:27.629 --> 00:00:30.269
You're not happy to remember me, but if I had a moment, it was really like this.

9
00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.310
I would have done something. I would have stopped the wedding.

10
00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:35.869
Shannon, I would have taken you four of these tracks.

11
00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:38.509
I'm so sorry. I should have done more, Shannon. I should have done more.

12
00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:48.939
I could never imagine someone other than my father to be so kind to me.

13
00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:54.609
I'm such a fool to let a heartless man in my life.

14
00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:56.609
I remember all, I remember all.

15
00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:03.140
In my next life, I wrote truths differently.

16
00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:08.829
In my next life, I will be sure you are the happiest woman in the world.

17
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.540
Shannon! Shannon! Shannon!
