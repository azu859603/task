1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,919
This is college? How can this be? I've been reborn ten years ago.

2
00:00:08,919 --> 00:00:16,789
I thought it would be great to meet her.

3
00:00:16,789 --> 00:00:31,260
I would be good.

4
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:41,929
I told you to buy lunch for Karen. Not some trash that you and your people leave. Something edible.

5
00:00:41,929 --> 00:00:48,929
Ricky tracks, in my previous life I gave you everything only for you to betray and murder me.

6
00:00:48,929 --> 00:00:50,929
This time, it'll be different.

7
00:00:50,929 --> 00:00:54,020
Are you deaf? Go! Now!

8
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:57,020
Ricky, it's just best if I go myself.

9
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,020
Don't even go.

10
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:08,019
She feels more value, serving people like me and you as compared to her people that she calls for family.

11
00:01:08,019 --> 00:01:10,019
Am I right? Ken?

12
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:27,359
Let this meal start my revenge.

13
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:30,359
Fetching lunch for your master again?

14
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:34,359
With brilliant girls like Karen around?

15
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:38,579
Ricky won't waste a glance on your kind.

16
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:40,579
You know that, right?

17
00:01:40,579 --> 00:01:44,780
Yeah, and what is my kind?

18
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,780
The, you're the daughter of his maid?

19
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:47,780
Kind?

20
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:53,790
That follows him to school every, the wishes.

21
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,790
She can marry a rich kind.

22
00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:04,790
The, if you're lucky, you can make his bed, sweep his floor and scrub his toilet kind.

23
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:07,109
You know, you're kind.

24
00:02:07,109 --> 00:02:10,300
Then Ricky tracks, tell you that?

25
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,300
Did he tell you that his maid back?

26
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:18,400
Is my family car? And that he is the son of...

27
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,400
My driver?

28
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,780
What a psycho!

29
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:27,780
Barking like a chihuahua just because Ricky won't look at you?

30
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,780
Hurry up.

31
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:31,780
Your master's lunch is getting cold.

32
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:37,500
The driver's son is saying I'm his maid.

33
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,500
Ricky tracks, you're gonna pay for that.
