1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:10,970
I told you to buy a lunch for Karen and you ate it, mine too?

2
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:14,570
God, you are just such a... Hey, aren't you?

3
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:16,929
I spent this with my own money.

4
00:00:16,929 --> 00:00:17,929
Two meals or twenty meals.

5
00:00:17,929 --> 00:00:18,929
What's it to do with you?

6
00:00:18,929 --> 00:00:19,929
Your money?

7
00:00:19,929 --> 00:00:23,890
Even if you spend it, it still tracks as money.

8
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:24,890
Duh.

9
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:25,890
Oh, is that so?

10
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:28,789
It was money, isn't it?

11
00:00:28,789 --> 00:00:33,490
I think getting lunch when you're told to, from your boss, is a

12
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:34,490
simple task.

13
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:40,969
And you came with me with something so simple, that you just got to be fucking stupid.

14
00:00:40,969 --> 00:00:43,329
You want to use my boss first?

15
00:00:43,329 --> 00:00:48,560
A completely fabled Bonnie Woman too lazy to get her lunch?

16
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,500
I think she deserves the tummy ache.

17
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,500
You?

18
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,219
You are a tracks family maid.

19
00:00:54,219 --> 00:00:57,380
Taking care of his girlfriend is literally your job.

20
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:58,380
How?

21
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,380
Is that so hard to comprehend?

22
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:01,380
Tricky tracks.

23
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:02,380
Am I your maid?

24
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:05,579
All right, Chad.

25
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:10,819
I don't know what game you're playing, but I'm not doing it.

26
00:01:10,819 --> 00:01:15,219
Don't cause any trouble, otherwise I will not forgive you no matter how hard you'd

27
00:01:15,219 --> 00:01:16,219
die.

28
00:01:16,219 --> 00:01:17,219
Daddy?

29
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:18,219
Oh, why would I?

30
00:01:18,219 --> 00:01:19,219
What did I do?

31
00:01:19,219 --> 00:01:22,730
You think you're so tough, don't you?

32
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:26,010
It's crazy how quickly you just lost a seat in the car.

33
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:32,239
I could care less if you welcome.

34
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:33,239
Your car?

35
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:36,719
It was never yours, and it's time you learned your place.
