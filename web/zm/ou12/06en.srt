1
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:19,660
After insulting Riki and Karen, she still has a nerve to keep freeloading rides.

2
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:20,660
Unbelievable.

3
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:23,660
A maid's daughter acting like a princess.

4
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,660
Riki is too quiet.

5
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:29,660
If it was me, I would have kicked around already.

6
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:32,170
Drive.

7
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:34,170
Let's, uh, wait for Riki.

8
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:40,060
Mr. Trax, uh, you work for my father and me.

9
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:42,380
I think I can safely wait on him.

10
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:44,380
Do you guys have a fight or something?

11
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:47,380
Look, I'll have a word with him for sure.

12
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,380
But could you try to be a little nicer to him?

13
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:52,380
I mean, I know you like to look down on him.

14
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,380
Mr. Trax, can you just drive?

15
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:57,380
I don't want him in my car. I don't want him at my house.

16
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,380
I just, I don't want to see him anymore.

17
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:01,439
Well, let's just, let's just be.

18
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:03,439
Drive or not?

19
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:06,439
She's usually so scared of Riki.

20
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:08,500
What's going on today?

21
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,500
Did you forget on her future father-in-law?

22
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,500
Or the fact my son will take over her father's business?

23
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,500
Mr. Trax, I asked politely.

24
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,500
Look, they're coming right now.
