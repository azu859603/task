1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,620
What the hell are you doing?

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:05,620
You expect a free ride in my car? Do you insult me?

3
00:00:06,769 --> 00:00:11,730
That's Ricky tracks his family's car. Why is he letting that bitch do that to him?

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:18,250
That's what you get for letting the maid drive in the car. If you give a mouse a cookie. Come on, Ricky! Pull her out!

5
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:24,750
Why do you have to act like this? Look, I'll forgive you about launching. I don't want your forgiveness.

6
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:28,690
You can walk over all I can. Stop following me.

7
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:36,039
Try? I have to get in the car, but I'll be exposed. If anyone goes on the son of the driver,

8
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:41,450
he'll be there.

9
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:50,149
Ricky helped him drag me out of my own car.

10
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,320
God.

11
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:06,430
It's job Ricky dealing with that ungrateful low life.

12
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:10,189
It's exactly what she deserved. Ricky is so cool.

13
00:01:10,829 --> 00:01:13,950
Dad, our driver forgot what we worked for.

14
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:18,579
Calling Ricky, asking for forgiveness.

15
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,939
It's too late.

16
00:01:21,939 --> 00:01:27,579
The only one bad game for forgiveness is him. Watch. My car is about to pull back.

17
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,849
Get out.

18
00:01:37,849 --> 00:01:42,170
Shannon, please get in the car. I'll take you wherever you want.
