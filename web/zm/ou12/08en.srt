1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Even Ricky's driver respects the maid's daughter?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,500
It does not make any sense.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,130
Why is Ricky getting out?

4
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:14,449
Shannon, was it really necessary for you to bother your father like that?

5
00:00:14,449 --> 00:00:16,449
I mean, he's a very busy man.

6
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:20,449
Oh, from now on, those two are not allowed in this car.

7
00:00:20,449 --> 00:00:22,449
That's a little childish, Shannon?

8
00:00:22,449 --> 00:00:23,449
Thank you.

9
00:00:23,449 --> 00:00:25,449
Not that close to you's my name.

10
00:00:25,449 --> 00:00:27,449
Remember who pays you?

11
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:32,450
Plus, I think a driver being asked to drive is a simple task.

12
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:36,450
If you can't handle it, feel free to quit.

13
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,450
You're right. I was wrong.

14
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:41,770
I am driving right now.

15
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:45,770
Shannon, that's enough.

16
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:48,770
It looks like the young master is mad.

17
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:53,770
Shannon, I get it if you don't like me, but you don't have to be a bully to Ricky.

18
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:55,770
He's always been so nice to you.

19
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:57,770
You even have the driver come back just for you.

20
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:59,770
You don't have to be so mean.

21
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:02,770
You know what? You don't even have to explain yourself to her.

22
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:06,769
She has never learned a single thing of gratitude in her entire life.

23
00:01:06,769 --> 00:01:10,769
And you just continue to keep crossing the line every time.
