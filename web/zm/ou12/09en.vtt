00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:09.140
Oh, there is a line to cross. I had no idea. But this is just the beginning Ricky tracks, Karen.

2
00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:10.140
Bye!

3
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.429
Driver, drive.

4
00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:23.089
Where's your bag? I don't know. Where's your friend Ricky?

5
00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:27.089
Oh, Ancho. From now on, I don't have any friends named Ricky.

6
00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:30.089
Yes, you'll finally come to your senses.

7
00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:34.439
Ancho was the kindness of all servants in the house.

8
00:00:34.439 --> 00:00:40.439
In my past life, she always warned me about Ricky, but I was so blindly in love that I pushed her away.

9
00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:42.439
In this life, I won't feel her again.

10
00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:45.439
Miss, I'm so sorry. I spoke out of turn.

11
00:00:45.439 --> 00:00:48.439
Oh, no, Ancho. It's okay. You're absolutely right.

12
00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:51.439
I think I'm gonna lay down, though. It's been a long day.

13
00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:58.140
All right. Johnny Wonder came by for a visit. I can send him away if you're too tired.

14
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.270
Johnny? Where is he?
