1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:03,520
Johnny?

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:08,849
This is 20 year old Johnny.

3
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:10,849
The fiance my father arranged for me.

4
00:00:10,849 --> 00:00:15,039
In my past life because of Ricky tracks, I ignored him.

5
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:19,039
And he only wanted to be with me, but I only wanted Ricky.

6
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:24,609
I not only refused him, but I also said hurtful things to him.

7
00:00:24,609 --> 00:00:26,609
It's really nice to see you again.

8
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:29,609
Miss Clark, it's a pleasure to see you.

9
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:33,380
Is there a reason why you came?

10
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:38,020
Actually, I came because I wanted to see you.

11
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:42,179
But I can see that you're a busy woman, so I won't keep you up.

12
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:50,270
Johnny, do you want to have dinner with me?

13
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:51,270
Really?

14
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,270
Yeah, I mean, Anjo is a pretty good chef.

15
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,590
Okay.

16
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,590
Let's go.
