1
00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:10.660
Alright, Ancho, I think it's time to start dinner.

2
00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.480
We're not waiting for Ricky.

3
00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.480
Why?

4
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.030
Thank goodness Ms. Shannon won't be a suck-up anymore.

5
00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:24.239
I'll have everything ready right away.

6
00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:27.219
Thank you.

7
00:00:27.219 --> 00:00:31.329
Yes.

8
00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:33.770
Johnny, your grades have been good in school, right?

9
00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.250
Well, yeah, I mean, I studied my part, so, yeah.

10
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:38.850
Well, mine are terrible.

11
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:39.850
Man.

12
00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.609
Would you want to be my tutor?

13
00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:45.049
I mean, you could just come here every day and help me study.

14
00:00:46.689 --> 00:00:49.929
Well, I feel like Ricky tracks as you two.

15
00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:52.770
And you love him so much that you push me away.

16
00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.299
Oh, well, he's about to get fired, so...

17
00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:01.820
Well, well, well, I mean, I mean, I'm available.

18
00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.340
And if you won't, you're gonna be such a marvel.

19
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.340
Yeah, tomorrow then.

20
00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:07.340
Yeah?

21
00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:08.340
Tomorrow?

22
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.540
Yeah.

23
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.540
Okay.

24
00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.299
Hey, Ancho, I'm really sorry, but I have to run as something came up.

25
00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:16.099
But thank you for having me here.

26
00:01:16.099 --> 00:01:17.099
Tomorrow.

27
00:01:17.099 --> 00:01:18.260
Tomorrow?

28
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:19.260
Tomorrow.

29
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:40.159
I...

30
00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:41.159
Shall we?

31
00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.799
Why did you think it was a good idea to tell my father a new one today?

32
00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:44.799
Huh?

33
00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:45.799
They found out everybody.

34
00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:46.799
What is wrong with you?

35
00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.280
Go out there and apologize to him right now, or...

36
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.280
Hey!

37
00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.280
I disciplined my driver.

38
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.280
I paid his salary, and he left me on the side of the road, and yet he wanted me to apologize?

39
00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.680
He is my father, and he had nothing to do with any of this.

40
00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.000
Anything he did, but I told him to.

41
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.319
You think when out of this, if you ever come, you can take it off of me.

42
00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.319
Come.

43
00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:12.319
I see how it is.

44
00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.599
Daddy only listens to you, in that case.

45
00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:22.020
You can both pack your back to me now.

46
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.759
Did you just say that?

47
00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:28.759
Ricky?

48
00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:30.400
I can't have you here anymore.

49
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.000
Ever since you started tittering me, my grades have only gotten worse.

50
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.439
Why am I paying you anything at all?

51
00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:37.439
Because you're fucking...

52
00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:39.919
No, that's fucking why.

53
00:02:39.919 --> 00:02:42.520
I explained the same shit to Karen.

54
00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.639
This is how I explained to you to pick up the information, no problem.

55
00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:47.639
You're dumb, as rocks.

56
00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:50.860
Search for any tittering me.

57
00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.300
But do not keep falling back to me when your grades are looking worse than they already

58
00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.300
are.

59
00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:57.300
Fine.

60
00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:03.500
I will, but I want you, and you're good for nothing father out of here.

61
00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:04.699
You know what?

62
00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:05.699
You're right.

63
00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:08.340
It's not because you're fucking stupid.

64
00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.830
It's because you're obsessed with him, you want to go out with him.

65
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:12.830
You can't focus.

66
00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.830
And that's why your grades are so good.

67
00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.669
I think you're talking about...

68
00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:23.270
This little fuss that you're creating, it's because you're jealous of me and Karen's relationship,

69
00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:24.270
right?

70
00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.949
You think I want to be with you?

71
00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:28.389
Oh my God.

72
00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:31.090
It's obvious.

73
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.789
Re-key tracks.

74
00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:36.789
In this life, I would never want to be with you.

75
00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:39.419
It's alright.

76
00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:41.939
You can say what I've...

77
00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:47.500
But if you disrespect me like that, ever again, in public, whatever happens to you next is

78
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:48.979
completely your fault.

79
00:03:48.979 --> 00:04:05.580
Did you be able to drop Karen off first?

80
00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.060
Alright, my boy.

81
00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.060
I'm a driver.

82
00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.409
You did not ask for my...

83
00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:21.079
From now on, no unnecessary people in my car, including him.

84
00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:22.079
I'm just sharing it.

85
00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.759
You have a good relationship with Re-key, right?

86
00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:29.319
I would want to let something small like this get in the way of your feelings for it.

87
00:04:29.399 --> 00:04:32.959
Last time I checked, your job description was a driver.

88
00:04:32.959 --> 00:04:36.050
Do you want to pursue therapy?

89
00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:37.730
That's probably why you didn't do...

90
00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:40.410
Oh, you probably want to do well in med school.

91
00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.769
Is that why you're behind the wheel?

92
00:04:42.769 --> 00:04:47.899
Don't talk to my f***.

93
00:04:47.899 --> 00:04:49.899
My driver liked that.

94
00:04:49.899 --> 00:04:50.899
Get out.

95
00:04:50.899 --> 00:04:51.899
What?

96
00:04:51.899 --> 00:04:57.949
Oh dear, you think you're worthy enough to sit with me.

97
00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:03.079
Drive!

98
00:05:03.079 --> 00:05:05.800
Shannon, you've really crossed the line this time.

99
00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.160
You've officially pissed me the f*** off.

100
00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.480
Re-key, what is going on with you?

101
00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.120
She's the daughter of your driver, and you're letting her push you around like this?

102
00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:19.449
Everyone says you're the rich on it, and she's the fake.

103
00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:26.680
Maybe they're wrong.

104
00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.449
So I heard you were talking to Johnny Wonder.

105
00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:30.850
And why do you care?

106
00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:36.009
No, bringing him around, trying to make me jealous, is never going to get him to give

107
00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:37.009
you if not.

108
00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:38.490
That's what you think.

109
00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:39.490
I want to think that.

110
00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.620
I mean, I don't even like thinking about you.

111
00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:47.389
You know what I can't stand?

112
00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:48.949
Women who can't make up there.

113
00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:52.680
I've made up my mind about you.

114
00:05:52.680 --> 00:06:01.139
You believe I've tolerated you for so long, but the way you treat me and spend my money

115
00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:02.170
on him.

116
00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:03.170
Aaron?

117
00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:09.100
Money?

118
00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:12.100
I've heard of that mind to fix your dumb ass brain.

119
00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:16.220
Well then maybe I should demand a refund and my grades would go up.

120
00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:19.220
Well it's not my fault, it's your mind's.

121
00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:20.220
Re-key, you're fired.

122
00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:21.220
What?

123
00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:22.220
You do find someone else?

124
00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:25.220
Don't worry, I already found a new tutor.

125
00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:30.300
You know, you playing hard to get.

126
00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.300
It's just not a thing to fix them.

127
00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:37.300
And if you keep it up, you're just going to lose me as a tutor.

128
00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:38.300
And, well, Aaron, what's that?

129
00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:39.300
Leave your shame?

130
00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:44.420
Um, go on the dumb one.

131
00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:50.540
Re-key, you're fired.

132
00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:52.240
You?

133
00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:55.240
Re-key, what's really going on between you and Shannon?

134
00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:56.240
Who knows you?

135
00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.490
I don't give a shit.

136
00:06:58.490 --> 00:06:59.490
Well, it's your birthday tomorrow.

137
00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:02.810
Are we still celebrating with your family about death?

138
00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:04.810
Are you going to help me run the dress?

139
00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:07.029
Re-key.

140
00:07:07.029 --> 00:07:08.290
Re-key.

141
00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:09.290
Oh, no.

142
00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:11.290
I'll buy the dress.

143
00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:15.759
No, no, no, no.

144
00:07:15.759 --> 00:07:17.920
That's what's going on.

145
00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:19.920
Shannon always plays my birthday celebrations.

146
00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:22.920
She's just acting dramatic behind the surprise.

147
00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:26.019
Oh, she's taking it too far.

148
00:07:26.019 --> 00:07:31.019
She might have to draw on her birthday party to get my forgiveness.

149
00:07:31.019 --> 00:07:36.610
Re-key, why aren't you saying anything?

150
00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:38.610
What's the note, everyone?

151
00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:41.610
Tomorrow night is my 20th birthday.

152
00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:43.610
It will be held at the Royal Court Hotel.

153
00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:45.610
There will be food.

154
00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:47.610
There will be drinks.

155
00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:48.610
There will be music.

156
00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:51.670
And, well, it will be a night to remember.

157
00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:54.670
Oh, my God, the Royal Court Hotel?

158
00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:57.670
That is, like, higher than five stars.

159
00:07:57.670 --> 00:08:01.829
The track's family owns the Royal Court.

160
00:08:01.829 --> 00:08:05.470
The staff literally fell to Reiki.

161
00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:07.470
Holy shit.

162
00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:09.470
Yes, you do have to get me a ticket.

163
00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:11.470
Get yourself a ticket?

164
00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:12.470
No, no, no, no.

165
00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:15.629
You see, you're personally invited.

166
00:08:15.629 --> 00:08:23.000
Actually, as a matter of fact, everybody here is invited.

167
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
Reiki, should we invite Shannon?

168
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Do you think she'll come?

169
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.000
Shannon, no.

170
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.580
Even without invitation, she'll still come running.

171
00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:35.580
Shannon, you think you're so clever.

172
00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:37.580
You think this party will save you?

173
00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:38.740
No.

174
00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:40.929
You're in for a rude awakening.

175
00:08:40.929 --> 00:08:42.929
Nobody disrespects me.

176
00:08:42.929 --> 00:08:45.929
Yeah, she can't seem to stay away from you.

177
00:08:45.929 --> 00:08:50.039
I'll have to teach her a lesson.

178
00:08:50.039 --> 00:08:53.039
God, Johnny is nothing like Reiki.

179
00:08:53.039 --> 00:08:54.039
Johnny has patience.

180
00:08:54.039 --> 00:08:56.039
He speaks well.

181
00:08:56.039 --> 00:08:57.039
He never complains.

182
00:08:57.039 --> 00:09:00.169
And, oh, my God, he's handsome.

183
00:09:00.169 --> 00:09:03.169
How could I have been so blind in my previous life?

184
00:09:03.169 --> 00:09:06.169
How could I waste all my time on some of the Reiki tracks,

185
00:09:06.169 --> 00:09:09.169
especially when Johnny was right there all along?

186
00:09:09.169 --> 00:09:12.379
Is there something you don't understand?

187
00:09:12.379 --> 00:09:13.379
Oh, no.

188
00:09:13.379 --> 00:09:15.379
I'm just too dumb.

189
00:09:15.379 --> 00:09:17.379
Shannon, you are not dumb.

190
00:09:17.379 --> 00:09:19.379
You have a bad study, Matt.

191
00:09:19.379 --> 00:09:20.860
Tell you what.

192
00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:22.860
Let me help you build a better foundation,

193
00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:24.860
and then if your grades still don't improve,

194
00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:26.860
you can kick me to the curb,

195
00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:28.860
and look, I won't even keep the money that you pay.

196
00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:29.860
Are you sure?

197
00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:30.860
I mean...

198
00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:31.860
Do you really mean all that?

199
00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:32.860
Of course.

200
00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:34.340
Here.

201
00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:37.340
What you want to do is you want to find the most powerful denominator you can.

202
00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:45.529
Shannon, seriously, what's your deal?

203
00:09:45.529 --> 00:09:46.529
Reiki, what do you want?

204
00:09:46.529 --> 00:09:48.529
You do my shit in the basement.

205
00:09:48.529 --> 00:09:51.529
Well, yeah, because this afternoon I told you you're fired.

206
00:09:51.529 --> 00:09:54.529
So, why would you stay at my house, especially in a nice room,

207
00:09:54.529 --> 00:09:57.529
and especially after I fired your father?

208
00:09:57.529 --> 00:10:00.529
If you're willing to stay, the basement is yours.

209
00:10:00.529 --> 00:10:03.529
You must take a stop on fucking humiliating me.

210
00:10:03.529 --> 00:10:04.690
You really hate me?

211
00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:06.690
I'm stupid and so dramatic.

212
00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:08.690
I don't think I don't know what you're up to.

213
00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:10.690
Tomorrow at the birthday party,

214
00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:12.690
I'll make sure you regret this.

215
00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:14.690
I'll make you kneel in front of everyone in apologies.

216
00:10:17.539 --> 00:10:21.830
Well, we're in the middle of a session, so it was stopped interrupting.

217
00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:32.600
Well, just wait.

218
00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:33.600
Three...

219
00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:34.600
Two...

220
00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:36.049
One...

221
00:10:36.049 --> 00:10:47.779
What the hell is she doing?

222
00:10:47.779 --> 00:10:54.620
Why is she acting so tough?

223
00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:59.379
She's trying to make me angry.

224
00:10:59.379 --> 00:11:02.610
Alright, I'll teach you a hard lesson for that.

225
00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:05.769
Hey, I'm really starting to see that, Johnny.

226
00:11:05.769 --> 00:11:07.769
Maybe I should just go.

227
00:11:07.769 --> 00:11:09.769
I mean, you don't seem like you're in the best moment, so...

228
00:11:09.769 --> 00:11:10.990
You're in the way.

229
00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:12.990
I am in a good mood.

230
00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:13.990
Are you sure?

231
00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:15.990
By the way, what are you doing tomorrow night?

232
00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:16.990
I don't know why.

233
00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:21.990
Do you want to go to the Royal Court Hotel for dinner?

234
00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:22.990
Yeah.

235
00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:24.990
I haven't been in years and I miss the food.

236
00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:25.990
Years?

237
00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:27.990
Didn't you go with Ricky last night?

238
00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:30.059
I mean, you guys seem to go there a lot, so...

239
00:11:30.059 --> 00:11:31.059
Oh, hey, now.

240
00:11:31.059 --> 00:11:32.059
How do you know that?

241
00:11:32.059 --> 00:11:34.059
The Royal Court Hotel is my...

242
00:11:34.059 --> 00:11:36.179
I was there too.

243
00:11:36.179 --> 00:11:38.179
I saw you guys.

244
00:11:38.179 --> 00:11:41.179
Should I start avoiding you like before?

245
00:11:41.179 --> 00:11:42.179
Do you want me to be with you?

246
00:11:42.179 --> 00:11:43.179
No, of course not.

247
00:11:43.179 --> 00:11:45.179
Okay, well then, I'll see you tomorrow.

248
00:11:45.179 --> 00:11:46.279
Okay.

249
00:11:46.279 --> 00:11:48.600
I'll see you then.

250
00:11:48.600 --> 00:12:16.200
That's good.

251
00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:19.490
Shannon, dare you show up here.

252
00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:22.490
Excuse me, what are you even talking about?

253
00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:28.090
After everything, you have the nerve to come to Ricky's birthday party?

254
00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:30.090
Oh, it's his birthday?

255
00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:32.139
You know what?

256
00:12:32.139 --> 00:12:36.419
Totally forgot.

257
00:12:36.419 --> 00:12:38.419
Now I remember.

258
00:12:38.419 --> 00:12:42.419
Last time I spent a hundred K on that asshole's birthday party.

259
00:12:42.419 --> 00:12:47.419
And when I was about to confess my feelings for him, he shoved his tongue down Karen's throat.

260
00:12:47.419 --> 00:12:48.450
Ugh.

261
00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:53.450
Well, this time, I'll give Ricky tracks an unforgettable birthday.

262
00:12:53.450 --> 00:12:55.450
Oh, quit pretending.

263
00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:59.450
Ricky didn't invite you, but you decided to show up anyway.

264
00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:01.700
You're so...

265
00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:03.700
Unclassy.

266
00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:05.700
Who do you think you are anyway?

267
00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:09.700
Are you, uh, Ricky's little bitch or parents?

268
00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:11.700
Oh, and I'm so sorry.

269
00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:13.700
I forgot your name, but only yours.

270
00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:15.700
Yap, yap, yap.

271
00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:17.700
Yancy, yapping.

272
00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:19.700
God, you're so annoying.

273
00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:25.340
Shannon, I'm surprised you showed.

274
00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:29.659
You know, going a little party like this as you're going to make me forgive you, right?

275
00:13:29.659 --> 00:13:30.659
Oh, Ricky, tracks.

276
00:13:30.659 --> 00:13:34.659
You are something, thinking that everything is about you.

277
00:13:34.659 --> 00:13:37.659
You're telling me this isn't my birthday party?

278
00:13:37.659 --> 00:13:38.659
Oh, no.

279
00:13:38.659 --> 00:13:40.659
Why would I throw a party for you?

280
00:13:40.659 --> 00:13:42.659
Unless Narcissist is just waiting on the cake.

281
00:13:42.659 --> 00:13:44.659
And what's that supposed to mean?

282
00:13:44.659 --> 00:13:46.659
Shannon, it's Ricky's birthday.

283
00:13:46.659 --> 00:13:48.659
Okay, let's not make a scene.

284
00:13:48.659 --> 00:13:50.659
He's always been so nice to you.

285
00:13:50.659 --> 00:13:52.659
Even his family's treated you like a friend.

286
00:13:52.659 --> 00:13:55.330
Not a servant, okay?

287
00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:59.759
Let's not make him angry.

288
00:13:59.759 --> 00:14:01.759
Hey, don't get violent with Karen.

289
00:14:01.759 --> 00:14:06.809
Alright, if you have a problem, you can take it up with me.

290
00:14:06.809 --> 00:14:09.809
Shannon, you will apologize to Karen right now.

291
00:14:09.809 --> 00:14:11.809
Ricky, it's fine.

292
00:14:11.809 --> 00:14:12.809
Just forget it.

293
00:14:12.809 --> 00:14:13.809
It's your birthday.

294
00:14:13.809 --> 00:14:17.059
I don't want to make a scene and I push in and did it purpose.

295
00:14:17.059 --> 00:14:20.059
Are you going to apologize or not?

296
00:14:20.059 --> 00:14:23.059
I didn't push her, so why the fuck should I apologize?

297
00:14:23.059 --> 00:14:26.059
How dare you talk back to Ricky like that?

298
00:14:26.059 --> 00:14:28.059
You're such a monster.

299
00:14:28.059 --> 00:14:34.059
You hate yourself so much that you make fun of Karen because she's pretty and kind.

300
00:14:34.059 --> 00:14:37.059
And that makes her an easy target for someone like you.

301
00:14:37.059 --> 00:14:44.779
If Ricky won't beat you, I will.

302
00:14:44.779 --> 00:14:47.870
You are Ricky's, but damn me!

303
00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:49.870
Someone needs to put you in your place.

304
00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:50.870
Stop!

305
00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:58.789
You must have some kind of death, Rich.

306
00:14:58.789 --> 00:15:10.509
Donnie, you saved me again.

307
00:15:10.509 --> 00:15:11.509
Again?

308
00:15:11.509 --> 00:15:12.509
What do you mean again?

309
00:15:12.509 --> 00:15:15.509
Shannon, get over here right now.

310
00:15:15.509 --> 00:15:22.919
Did I not?

311
00:15:22.919 --> 00:15:24.919
Don't touch her.

312
00:15:24.919 --> 00:15:38.669
You didn't come here for a birthday party.

313
00:15:38.669 --> 00:15:40.669
No, you came here for him.

314
00:15:40.669 --> 00:15:41.669
I told you.

315
00:15:41.669 --> 00:15:43.669
I didn't like seeing you around him.

316
00:15:43.669 --> 00:15:45.669
Ricky, what is wrong with you?

317
00:15:45.669 --> 00:15:47.669
When you're lacking, you try to kill me.

318
00:15:47.669 --> 00:15:50.669
You didn't do anything, but now you get mad when someone tries to help me.

319
00:15:50.669 --> 00:15:53.279
What was your head?

320
00:15:53.279 --> 00:15:54.279
My lacking?

321
00:15:54.279 --> 00:15:56.279
Yancy would never hurt a fly.

322
00:15:56.279 --> 00:15:58.279
You hit Karen first.

323
00:15:58.279 --> 00:16:11.990
Pretty great, but you know, kind of embarrassing yourself here.

324
00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:14.990
And you really don't want that, right?

325
00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:22.840
You're putting me through all this shit because you want me to throw you a fucking birthday party?

326
00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:28.129
If being Karen bothers you, it's just too much for you to handle.

327
00:16:28.129 --> 00:16:33.129
Well, I could just easily step aside and then you could find the chill out.

328
00:16:33.129 --> 00:16:35.129
You're so pathetic.

329
00:16:35.129 --> 00:16:38.129
Can't let you rich boy and let you get tarnished in front of everyone.

330
00:16:38.129 --> 00:16:39.129
Fine.

331
00:16:39.129 --> 00:16:42.129
I'll play along and you'll see how it turns out.

332
00:16:42.129 --> 00:16:44.509
You know what?

333
00:16:44.509 --> 00:16:45.509
I understand.

334
00:16:45.509 --> 00:16:51.509
And I don't want to ruin anyone's fun, so I rented out the platinum lounge for your party.

335
00:16:51.509 --> 00:16:53.509
I hope that's okay.

336
00:16:53.509 --> 00:16:56.509
In the end, Shannon is still throwing me the party.

337
00:16:56.509 --> 00:17:02.639
She really is my obedient little bitch, and she will be forever.

338
00:17:02.639 --> 00:17:04.640
You know what, that does just fine.

339
00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:07.640
Thank you so much, that means a lot to me.

340
00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:09.640
Of course.

341
00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:12.640
Everyone, there is nothing to see here.

342
00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:13.640
Let's get this party wrong.

343
00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:14.640
Come on.

344
00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:15.640
Let's party.

345
00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:18.059
Enjoy the rest of your night, Johnny.

346
00:17:18.059 --> 00:17:25.569
Did you really hire out the platinum?

347
00:17:25.569 --> 00:17:26.569
God no.

348
00:17:26.569 --> 00:17:34.049
But it's Ricky's birthday party, so he might as well have some fun until he can't pay the bill.

349
00:17:34.049 --> 00:17:38.049
You know, I heard the owner of this hotel is a complete jackass.

350
00:17:38.049 --> 00:17:41.049
I wonder what he's going to do when he can't pay the bill.

351
00:17:41.049 --> 00:17:42.660
My money?

352
00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:43.660
He's going to break his legs.

353
00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:49.619
Actually, I've heard that the owner of the Royal Court Hotel is not such a bad guy.

354
00:17:49.619 --> 00:17:52.900
Oh man, what a shame.

355
00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:57.900
You know, I guess I could settle for him kneeling and begging for forgiveness.

356
00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:01.019
You're right.

357
00:18:01.019 --> 00:18:04.180
Hey, thanks for saving me.

358
00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:05.180
I owe you dinner.

359
00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:06.180
Let's go.

360
00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:07.180
Sure.

361
00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:15.019
Tabio, so straight from New Zealand.

362
00:18:15.019 --> 00:18:17.019
Mr. Trax, your card's been declined.

363
00:18:17.019 --> 00:18:19.019
What do you mean my card's been declined?

364
00:18:19.019 --> 00:18:20.019
I mean, it's been a decline.

365
00:18:20.019 --> 00:18:23.400
However, if you have another one, go about it that way.

366
00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:26.940
Somebody else didn't pay for this already?

367
00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:27.940
Shannon?

368
00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:30.420
Oh, okay.

369
00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:32.420
You look mad at this.

370
00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:33.420
Is there something wrong?

371
00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:34.420
I know.

372
00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:36.420
You did this on purpose.

373
00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:37.670
Don't worry.

374
00:18:37.670 --> 00:18:39.670
I'm not going to expose you yet.

375
00:18:39.670 --> 00:18:43.670
But just know your embarrassment is just the beginning.

376
00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:48.680
This is for our spread?

377
00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:49.680
Yes, sir.

378
00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:50.839
Thank you.

379
00:18:50.839 --> 00:18:51.839
Perfect.

380
00:18:51.839 --> 00:18:53.839
Mateo, I'd like you to have George organize everything as usual.

381
00:18:53.839 --> 00:19:00.230
And tonight, please take a hundred out of Tilpiers.

382
00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:07.650
Well, since Ricky can't ask him nicely, I guess I'm just going to have to tell everyone

383
00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:08.650
the truth.

384
00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:09.650
Oh, okay.

385
00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:10.650
All right, Shannon.

386
00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:11.650
All right.

387
00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:15.710
Can you please stay for the bill?

388
00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:24.339
You can, Mr. Trax.

389
00:19:24.339 --> 00:19:27.339
I've never been humiliated like this before.

390
00:19:27.339 --> 00:19:29.339
Everyone is laughing at me.

391
00:19:29.339 --> 00:19:33.480
I'll make a big double for this.

392
00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:35.480
Is Shannon paying for Ricky's party?

393
00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:37.480
Can he not afford it?

394
00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:39.480
Of course he can afford it.

395
00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:43.480
He gave his credit card to his maid this morning for food, and look where she went.

396
00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:46.539
The most expensive restaurant.

397
00:19:46.539 --> 00:19:49.539
She is so shameless.

398
00:19:49.539 --> 00:19:50.769
Anytime.

399
00:19:50.769 --> 00:20:03.559
Well, I was supposed to treat you to dinner, but this whole scene with Mateo, I mean...

400
00:20:03.559 --> 00:20:05.559
Johnny, I just hope you had a good night.

401
00:20:05.559 --> 00:20:08.559
You've spent enough money on that asshole already.

402
00:20:08.559 --> 00:20:09.619
Okay?

403
00:20:09.619 --> 00:20:12.750
I'll make sure that Mateo refunds all of it straight back.

404
00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:17.869
Shannon, do you own the hotel?

405
00:20:17.869 --> 00:20:20.180
Yes.

406
00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:25.180
There is no need to repay me, and there's no need to spend money on Ricky

407
00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:27.180
of this food.

408
00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:29.250
It's to die for.

409
00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:30.250
Thank you.

410
00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:31.250
Thank you.

411
00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:32.250
I'm very proud of our menu.

412
00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:34.250
I think Luigi has done a wonderful job in the kitchen.

413
00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:37.250
And actually, I want you to feel comfortable here.

414
00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:40.250
Shannon, I want you to feel free to come whenever you like.

415
00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:44.250
Are you suggesting that I eat for free?

416
00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:48.500
Well, do you pay for your food at your own home?

417
00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:49.500
No.

418
00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:50.500
So...

419
00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:55.500
In my past life, my father tried to arrange a marriage between Johnny and me,

420
00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:58.500
but I resisted and refused to get to know him.

421
00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:00.500
What a terrible mistake.

422
00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:01.500
He's wonderful.

423
00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:02.630
It's late.

424
00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:04.630
Do you think I drive me home?

425
00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:05.819
Yes.

426
00:21:05.819 --> 00:21:42.839
It's finally your home.

427
00:21:42.839 --> 00:21:52.420
I bought Ricky to apologize to you.

428
00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:57.420
Mr. Trax, your son didn't offend me, so he doesn't have to apologize.

429
00:21:57.420 --> 00:21:59.420
But you, uh, fired him?

430
00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:00.420
Yeah, I did.

431
00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:02.420
But I also fired you.

432
00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:05.420
One was a tutor who made my grades worse.

433
00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:09.420
And the other was a driver who loved me on the side of the road.

434
00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:13.420
But so funny is they still had the nerve to live on my property.

435
00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:15.420
Uh, Miss Clark, I...

436
00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:16.420
Shannon.

437
00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:18.710
It was my fault.

438
00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:19.710
I...

439
00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:21.710
I need this job.

440
00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:23.710
That's why there was my classmate.

441
00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:24.710
Get let in down.

442
00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:28.710
Well, you should have thought about that before leaving me on the side of the road.

443
00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:30.710
I'll talk to Ricky.

444
00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:35.259
I'll make sure he's the best teacher you ever, ever had.

445
00:22:35.259 --> 00:22:40.259
Mr. Trax, you keep talking about your son, but, um, he's just sitting there.

446
00:22:40.259 --> 00:22:41.259
Not apologizing.

447
00:22:41.259 --> 00:22:51.859
I'm moping.

448
00:22:51.859 --> 00:22:53.859
Do you really want her to find us both?

449
00:22:53.859 --> 00:22:55.859
I owe a lot of money.

450
00:22:55.859 --> 00:22:58.859
I need this job to pay it off.

451
00:22:58.859 --> 00:23:00.859
Or it comes out of you to wish it.

452
00:23:00.859 --> 00:23:02.980
I owe her a good side.

453
00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:04.980
The entire family fortune could be yours.

454
00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:10.980
Hours.

455
00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:12.980
Have you heard me clearly?

456
00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:15.980
Get your shit together and apologize.

457
00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:20.289
You know, I'm getting tired.

458
00:23:20.289 --> 00:23:23.339
I should probably get a bed.

459
00:23:23.339 --> 00:23:24.339
I told you.

460
00:23:24.339 --> 00:23:26.339
Apologized to Miss Clark.

461
00:23:26.339 --> 00:23:27.339
Now!

462
00:23:27.339 --> 00:23:42.039
Shannon, you have gone way too far this time.

463
00:23:42.039 --> 00:23:47.140
Ricky Trax, in my past life, I not only supported you.

464
00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:50.230
But you're gambling addict of a father as well.

465
00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:55.390
Let's see how you pay off his debt without the protection of the Clark family.

466
00:23:55.390 --> 00:24:04.230
Shannon, did you really pay for Ricky's birthday party?

467
00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:08.640
Because we thought he was the rich one.

468
00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:13.640
So this means, look, if you want to know more, just ask your master himself.

469
00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:15.640
Sure, he'll tell you everything.

470
00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:19.730
We just find it really strange.

471
00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:23.730
If you spend so much money on him, why isn't he with you?

472
00:24:23.730 --> 00:24:25.730
Why is he with Karen?

473
00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:30.730
Because, because no matter how much of my own money she decides to go back at me,

474
00:24:30.730 --> 00:24:38.730
it'll never change her poor grades, her two timing heart, and her soul full of lies.

475
00:24:38.730 --> 00:24:44.730
And there is not a single thing that you can pay your calls close.

476
00:24:44.730 --> 00:24:47.430
That's right.

477
00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:51.430
She's at the bottom of the class because of her grades.

478
00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:55.430
She throws money at Ricky to impress him, but then goes out with someone else.

479
00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:58.460
Even if you're rich, she's a bad person.

480
00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:00.460
Exactly.

481
00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:02.460
Bad brain, bad heart.

482
00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:04.460
And I wonder why Ricky doesn't like her.

483
00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:06.460
Yes, this party.

484
00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:12.460
She insisted on throwing this event and followed my credit card.

485
00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:17.460
She's doing all this to humiliate, embarrass all of you.

486
00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:23.460
And before you can even say that it's your money, it's the money that's owed to me

487
00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:25.460
for trying to fix your brain.

488
00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:27.460
Your money doesn't mean shit.

489
00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:31.640
What are you laughing at?

490
00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:39.130
I think you are the worst tutor in the entire world.

491
00:25:39.130 --> 00:25:42.130
You know, it's incredible that you do great in class.

492
00:25:42.130 --> 00:25:43.130
Because I am great.

493
00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:44.130
My grades are great.

494
00:25:44.130 --> 00:25:46.130
It's your fault that yours isn't.

495
00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:48.130
Is it because I'm dumb?

496
00:25:48.130 --> 00:25:50.130
Or is it because of the way you teach?

497
00:25:50.130 --> 00:25:52.130
Whatever.

498
00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:54.130
Didn't you get a new tutor?

499
00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:56.130
How's that been working out for you?

500
00:25:56.130 --> 00:25:58.130
Actually, we even know the test coming up.

501
00:25:58.130 --> 00:26:00.130
Let's hear what that works out.

502
00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:02.450
You want a bad?

503
00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:03.450
Sure.

504
00:26:03.450 --> 00:26:11.450
If you move up a hundred spots on the rink, which I'm asking about, I will admit that I was wrong.

505
00:26:11.450 --> 00:26:12.579
Deal!

506
00:26:12.579 --> 00:26:13.670
Cool.

507
00:26:14.769 --> 00:26:21.769
Actually, I'm so confident in this bet that if I do wind up losing, I'll even run ten miles on the track.

508
00:26:21.769 --> 00:26:24.960
Ricky, what does that even have to do with me?

509
00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:33.460
If I win, they want you to kneel down until I forgive you.

510
00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:36.859
Are you insane?

511
00:26:36.859 --> 00:26:39.859
You think it's okay to even ask that of Ricky?

512
00:26:39.859 --> 00:26:40.859
Sure.

513
00:26:40.859 --> 00:26:41.859
He'll do it.

514
00:26:41.859 --> 00:26:46.859
As long as you promise to do the same exact thing.

515
00:26:46.859 --> 00:26:52.859
You have to beg like a puppy every day for a week.

516
00:26:52.859 --> 00:26:57.859
Unless you scared and wanna bow out.

517
00:26:57.859 --> 00:27:03.380
Is he?

518
00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:05.579
She actually agreed?

519
00:27:05.579 --> 00:27:07.579
She's completely out of her mind.

520
00:27:07.579 --> 00:27:14.819
I'm insane!

521
00:27:14.819 --> 00:27:15.819
I haven't seen you as part of her.

522
00:27:15.819 --> 00:27:16.819
What are you doing here?

523
00:27:16.819 --> 00:27:18.819
I missed you so I came back.

524
00:27:18.819 --> 00:27:19.819
Buffalo.

525
00:27:19.819 --> 00:27:24.779
Oh my god.

526
00:27:24.779 --> 00:27:26.779
Is this Shannon's new target?

527
00:27:26.779 --> 00:27:29.779
Ricky, is this a guy he said she's been hanging out with?

528
00:27:29.779 --> 00:27:32.059
Yeah, that's him.

529
00:27:32.059 --> 00:27:36.059
She's been gone for a while now.

530
00:27:36.059 --> 00:27:39.170
She wants him.

531
00:27:39.170 --> 00:27:42.170
Why is she all over a guy in his 50s?

532
00:27:42.170 --> 00:27:43.200
I?

533
00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:45.490
She wasn't rich.

534
00:27:45.490 --> 00:27:48.490
Shannon got herself a sugar daddy.

535
00:27:48.490 --> 00:27:49.490
Ew!

536
00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:52.059
I wonder why Ricky hates her.

537
00:27:52.059 --> 00:27:54.059
She's disgusting.

538
00:27:54.059 --> 00:27:57.059
Sharon, I know it's your father.

539
00:27:57.059 --> 00:28:00.059
But if you think I'll tell anyone, not Chan!

540
00:28:00.059 --> 00:28:01.819
Enjoy your sugar daddy.

541
00:28:01.819 --> 00:28:05.519
Ricky, do you think she's getting all of her money from that old heart?

542
00:28:05.519 --> 00:28:07.559
Do you think she's that lucky?

543
00:28:07.559 --> 00:28:11.059
She's relying on someone, whether it's you or her sugar daddy.

544
00:28:11.059 --> 00:28:15.059
Shelly, this is only the beginning.

545
00:28:15.059 --> 00:28:16.059
What's going on?

546
00:28:16.059 --> 00:28:18.059
You're not usually this happy to see me.

547
00:28:18.059 --> 00:28:19.319
What happened?

548
00:28:19.319 --> 00:28:20.319
Nothing.

549
00:28:20.319 --> 00:28:23.319
I just... I feel like I haven't seen you in a lifetime.

550
00:28:23.319 --> 00:28:25.319
I just really missed you.

551
00:28:25.319 --> 00:28:29.319
In my past life, Dad was killed in an accident on a business trip.

552
00:28:29.319 --> 00:28:32.319
The whole Clark Corporation was thrown into chaos.

553
00:28:32.319 --> 00:28:39.319
Somehow, because I was a fool, Ricky Trax and his good for nothing father took the company from me.

554
00:28:39.319 --> 00:28:45.319
In this life, I'm not only going to protect Clark Corporation, but I'm going to protect my father as well.

555
00:28:46.859 --> 00:28:51.920
Shannon Love, is that Ricky Trax still causing you trouble?

556
00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:53.920
Please, listen to me.

557
00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:54.920
He's bad news.

558
00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:56.920
Don't spend your time there.

559
00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:58.920
He's not worth your time or attention.

560
00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:00.920
I'd like to introduce you to a friend's son.

561
00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:01.920
Johnny Wonder.

562
00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:02.920
Listen, I know.

563
00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:03.920
I know.

564
00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:07.920
It's a ridiculous name, but he is a terrific young man.

565
00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:10.920
From a wealthy family that's well respected.

566
00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:12.920
Would you give him a chance for me?

567
00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:13.920
For you?

568
00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:15.920
Anything.

569
00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:17.920
Did help just freeze over?

570
00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:21.920
Whenever I criticize Ricky, she loses her mind.

571
00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:24.950
Shannon Love, are you sure everything's okay?

572
00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:30.880
Well, I mean, I did fire Ricky Trax and his father.

573
00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:36.579
But if I do see Johnny Wonder, will you promise me one thing?

574
00:29:36.579 --> 00:29:39.700
No more business trips.

575
00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:40.700
You will stay home.

576
00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:41.700
Very well.

577
00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:42.700
I promise.

578
00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:45.700
In fact, tonight, I'm seeing the Wonder family.

579
00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:47.700
Would you like to join me?

580
00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:52.740
Well, I would, but I'm going to see my new tutor, Johnny Wonder.

581
00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:55.740
So, well, please, young lady.

582
00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:57.740
The Chipoff field block.

583
00:29:57.740 --> 00:29:58.740
I'm the armabella.

584
00:29:58.740 --> 00:29:59.740
Go on.

585
00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:05.069
Hey, uh, I got to tell you something.

586
00:30:05.069 --> 00:30:06.069
Yeah.

587
00:30:06.069 --> 00:30:12.069
I made a bet with Ricky, that if I don't move up a hundred places on the next exam,

588
00:30:12.069 --> 00:30:14.069
I have to kneel down and beg.

589
00:30:14.069 --> 00:30:16.069
A hundred places?

590
00:30:16.069 --> 00:30:18.069
What if you win?

591
00:30:18.069 --> 00:30:22.069
Oh, well, if I win, he has to run ten miles, bow down and beg.

592
00:30:22.069 --> 00:30:23.069
Okay.
