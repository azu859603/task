00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160
Look, I guess I'll help you win, then.

2
00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:03.359
Wait, really?

3
00:00:03.359 --> 00:00:07.599
Yeah, I mean, look, you're working hard, you're clearly improving, so...

4
00:00:07.599 --> 00:00:09.039
Well, I know.

5
00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:12.800
I know I'm doing a little better, but a hundred places?

6
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.910
I know, but we've got the time.

7
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.070
Plus, as far as I can see, I mean, Ricky Trax was a terrible tutor.

8
00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:23.390
Look, I'm pretty sure that he was the reason that you're so far behind.

9
00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:25.649
You knew it.

10
00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:26.929
What a freaking able!

11
00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:27.649
Oh!

12
00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.899
Mr. Wonder, my grades are in your hands.

13
00:00:32.859 --> 00:00:33.340
Here.

14
00:00:39.659 --> 00:00:41.100
Attention, class.

15
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.020
The monthly exams have come back, and as expected,

16
00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:49.820
the top of the class are Ricky and Cameron.

17
00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.299
I guess Shannon will be running all afternoon.

18
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.100
But I would like to draw attention to someone else.

19
00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:02.060
Ms. Shannon Clark.

20
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.950
Professor, did Shannon go from dead last to second to last?
