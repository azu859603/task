00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
Yesi, I expect you to be respectful and shut your mouth.

2
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:09,839
Shannon has moved up 253 places. That is amazing.

3
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:15,089
What? 200 places? A professor found us in a mistake because

4
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:18,210
your grades are so poor, there's no way she could have...

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,460
I made no mistake. Shannon, you have done a great job. Keep up the good work.

6
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:25,339
Thanks professor.

7
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:30,140
What was?

8
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:32,939
Did you forget about a little black?

9
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:34,859
You got lucky this time.

10
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:37,060
So what?

11
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,100
Luck or no luck, you lost the bet.

12
00:00:40,659 --> 00:00:43,299
So you better start running and then kneel down and beg.

13
00:00:44,929 --> 00:00:46,609
Unless you want to beg now.

14
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:50,100
Shannon, I'm acting all high and mighty.

15
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,979
Moving up 200 places is not that impressive.

16
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:55,859
Ricky is right first and Karen the second.

17
00:00:55,859 --> 00:00:58,899
You don't see them acting all high and mighty.

18
00:00:58,899 --> 00:01:00,979
Girl, why are you even yapping?

19
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:04,739
Ricky placed a bet that I couldn't move up 100 places.

20
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:08,819
And guess what? I moved up 200.

21
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:10,579
So it's time to pay up Ricky tracks.

22
00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:15,859
Karen's a lap dog and you dream of Nancy's heart.
