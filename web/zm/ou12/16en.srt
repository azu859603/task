1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,050
You're being unreasonable, the teacher told you to retake the exam, so stop arguing.

2
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:12,369
This retake is a chance to clear your name.

3
00:00:12,369 --> 00:00:16,289
You don't want people doubting you behind your back, do you?

4
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:17,289
Professor, I'm sorry.

5
00:00:17,289 --> 00:00:24,570
The reasoning behind this is absolutely absurd, but for you, I will retake the exam.

6
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:26,769
Shannon, it's no big deal.

7
00:00:26,769 --> 00:00:28,769
There's no need to feel guilty.

8
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:30,769
Who says to feel guilty?

9
00:00:30,769 --> 00:00:32,770
Still making excuses.

10
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:33,770
Stomach?

11
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:35,770
Yes, you shut up.

12
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:41,799
You're always trying to find something to bitch about because you're so boring for Karen's approval.

13
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:46,799
Professor, since she accused me without any evidence, should there be consequences?

14
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:50,500
What did you say?

15
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:56,500
Professor, Yancy has accused me of cheating without any proof and that has targeted me repeatedly

16
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,500
for weeks.

17
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:04,920
If I retake the exam and prove that I didn't cheat, I think she should drop out.

18
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,920
You want her to drop out?

19
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,140
Seriously?

20
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,140
How could she be like this?
