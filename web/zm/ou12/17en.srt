1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:03,049
You want her to drop out?

2
00:00:03,049 --> 00:00:07,049
Professor, she made a stupid rumor about me cheating.

3
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:13,240
Even if I prove my innocence, I will always be known as the girl who was accused of cheating.

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,239
Wouldn't that ruin my reputation?

5
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:22,370
What if I can't handle the pressure and I do something drastic, like, kill myself?

6
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:26,370
Suicide? What should we do then? Maybe she is letting go.

7
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:30,370
Alright, alright, Shannon, we get it.

8
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:34,369
Yeah, and see, didn't she insist I cheated?

9
00:00:34,369 --> 00:00:36,369
Or, are you scared of your own words?

10
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:43,590
I'm not afraid. Fine, but if I'm right then you have to drop out because I'm not going to be the same.

11
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:44,590
Do!

12
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:50,729
Professor, can I take the exam?

13
00:00:50,729 --> 00:00:53,729
And can you make sure Ricky keeps his word as well?

14
00:00:53,729 --> 00:01:03,719
Do you really want to do this right now?

15
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:07,939
I mean, when they do catch you, they will kick you out of school.

16
00:01:07,939 --> 00:01:10,939
Just confess I'll help give you a kiss to the boy.

17
00:01:10,939 --> 00:01:12,390
Okay?

18
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:14,390
We'll do better a little bit.

19
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:15,390
I won't make you up.

20
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:16,390
Thanks, Ricky.

21
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:19,390
But you will have to know that I'm ready for getting this.

22
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:23,019
Whatever.

23
00:01:23,019 --> 00:01:26,019
When I pass this test, it'll be your dignity on the line.

24
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:32,019
So you better start warming up those calves, not just for running but for kneeling as well.

25
00:01:32,019 --> 00:01:33,019
Thank you.
