00:00:06.219 --> 00:00:22.519
Professor, are you stalling because you know she cheated?

2
00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:23.719
Because I know she did.

3
00:00:23.719 --> 00:00:28.480
Professor, if she did so poorly, why don't we just let this end and cancel the bet?

4
00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.439
I think Yancea wouldn't force her to drop out if Shannon just...

5
00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:38.119
Oh, just... Karen, you're so kind, but don't you remember she brutally insulted you?

6
00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:40.359
She deserves to be kicked out of school.

7
00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:41.520
She's right, Karen.

8
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.200
She should run 10 miles and then kneel before she's got to learn somehow.

9
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.679
Shannon, I think you should just apologize to Ricky and Jancea.

10
00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:53.439
We can just forget that any of this happened, okay?

11
00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:55.759
Why are you guys even talking?

12
00:00:55.759 --> 00:00:58.079
I mean, has the professor said anything?

13
00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.679
Do you know what was on my test?

14
00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:03.920
Please give him a chance before you start talking shit.

15
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.319
Attention, class.

16
00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:10.840
I would all like you to know that Shannon's test was much more difficult than all of yours.

17
00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.879
Professor, stop defending her.

18
00:01:12.879 --> 00:01:14.400
If she failed, she failed.

19
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.400
Exactly.

20
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.049
If she wasn't a cheater, she would have done just fine on both of us.
