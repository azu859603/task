1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:04,070
Shannon, I'm giving you one last chance to come clean.

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:06,370
Karen, this is your final warning.

3
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:09,869
Back up or don't come to playing when your face hurts more than Nancy's.

4
00:00:09,869 --> 00:00:15,169
As I've said before, this test is much harder than the previous exam,

5
00:00:15,169 --> 00:00:20,269
and I'm happy to say that Shannon scored higher than before.

6
00:00:20,269 --> 00:00:23,269
So it is clear that she did not cheat.

7
00:00:23,269 --> 00:00:25,960
Who is this possible? How could you not have cheated?

8
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,960
Professor, you must have miscalculated the scores.

9
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:29,960
We're getting back!

10
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:35,960
Shannon, you had made incredible progress, and I am very impressed.

11
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,460
What have you done to continue this progress?

12
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:41,460
It's quite simple, Professor.

13
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,960
I had a bad tutor, and we have a good one.

14
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,960
It feels really good doing, Will.

15
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:53,460
Well, this incident right here proves how toxic this classroom environment is.

16
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,460
And I will do everything in my tower to make sure that Shannon's name is clear

17
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:05,959
and that anybody that falsely accused Shannon of cheating shall be punished as well.

18
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:13,280
Nancy, you said if I don't cheat, you will drop out.

19
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,280
So are you gonna stick to your word?
