00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.150
If you don't drop out, I'll sue you for spreading rumors and false accusations.

2
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:12.789
And if that's not enough, our teacher knows that you're a dishonest, untrustworthy liar.

3
00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:16.859
I can only imagine the letter of recommendation he'll write about you.

4
00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.820
Shannon, we're all friends.

5
00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.460
She was just worried about you going down the wrong path morally.

6
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.699
She was trying to wake you up.

7
00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:26.699
Don't ruin her future.

8
00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:27.699
Right.

9
00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:29.699
Isn't forcing her to drop out too much?

10
00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:30.699
No.

11
00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:35.539
Karen, if you care about Yancey so much, you can drop out in your place.

12
00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:37.979
I mean, Ricky would take care of you.

13
00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:39.299
Shannon?

14
00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:40.299
You care about us.

15
00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:41.299
Yeah.

16
00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:42.299
Karen defended you.

17
00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:44.299
She treats everyone equally.

18
00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:45.299
Treats everyone equally.

19
00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:47.939
Why does she want you not to mean to drop out?

20
00:00:47.939 --> 00:00:48.939
Huh?

21
00:00:48.939 --> 00:00:50.100
Of course.

22
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.100
I would defend you.

23
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.100
Yancey?

24
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.219
Dropping out is a little too much.

25
00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.700
Shut up.

26
00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.060
You are always acting like a saint, but I never forgot, so you deserve what's coming

27
00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:03.060
to you.

28
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.060
Ask for you, Yancey.

29
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:11.939
If you really, really don't want to drop out, I guess we can make an arrangement.

30
00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:12.299
Please.
