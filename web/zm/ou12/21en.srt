1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,839
Please, whatever it takes.

2
00:00:02,839 --> 00:00:10,349
Oh, since you're someone who spread false accusations and doesn't want to drop out,

3
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:14,310
you can run 20 miles around the track.

4
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:15,789
But now you're running.

5
00:00:15,789 --> 00:00:19,670
I want you to chant, I'm falsely accused, Shannon.

6
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:21,670
Shannon didn't cheat.

7
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:22,670
Okay.

8
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:26,120
She passed on the exam.

9
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,679
There is no need to do this, I thought.

10
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,560
Ricky tracks thinks it's time to lecture me.

11
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:36,280
Why don't you kneel down and beg until I forgive you?

12
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,770
Thank you.

13
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:41,990
Ricky!

14
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:42,990
Ricky!

15
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:43,990
Take me!

16
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:45,119
Yeah!

17
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:46,119
It said you'd kneel.

18
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:47,119
I'm just helping.

19
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:48,119
Now beg.

20
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:52,079
Shannon, perhaps you shouldn't ruin friendship over a text.

21
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,719
Oh, Professor, these people aren't my friends.

22
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,479
If they don't keep their word, I'll never let it go and I'll drive them out of school.

23
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:00,700
Oh no.

24
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:01,700
It's 10 miles.

25
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:06,780
I'll run 10, also, 20.
