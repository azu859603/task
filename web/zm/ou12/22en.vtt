00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:06.830
Shannon, are you trying to kill her? She can't run 20 miles.

2
00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.699
Oh, please, she made the bet. She should honor it.

3
00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:15.919
Unless you want to run in her place.

4
00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:20.829
How about this?

5
00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:23.829
You don't have to run the 20, and you both run 10.

6
00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:28.829
Since you're so willing to help anyone in me.

7
00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:33.829
Actually, I have asthma, so I can't.

8
00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:36.380
Well, you don't see. That's right.

9
00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.380
But it looks like Karen's unwilling.

10
00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:44.729
Shannon, she's so late.

11
00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:51.109
What are you doing?

12
00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:52.109
Run!

13
00:00:52.109 --> 00:01:47.519
Come on!

14
00:01:47.519 --> 00:02:01.579
You're awake. Thank God.

15
00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:03.579
You need to get over yourself.

16
00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:06.579
You had a whole team of specialists check every nook,

17
00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:10.580
brandy, and inch of your body, and they said they were fine.

18
00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:17.909
Anything the doctor just said you need to work out a little more.

19
00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:20.909
Looks like you can finish those 12 miles as soon as possible.

20
00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:24.289
No, I can't.

21
00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:28.289
I cannot keep running. If I keep running, I'm going to die.
