00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.139
You're here. Did you come to cheer for Rudy?

2
00:00:04.139 --> 00:00:08.140
No, I have zero interest in cheering for him.

3
00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:12.140
I'm not sure their joke on a tennis ball didn't cheer for you.

4
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.140
Shannon, you are such a horrible liar.

5
00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.140
You come cheer for me all the time.

6
00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:23.460
Oh, well, I hate to break it to you, but I'm not here for you. I'm over it.

7
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.460
Look, just because you got your grades up and all that, doesn't mean you're special.

8
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.460
And that doesn't mean that you're better than me and Karen either.

9
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.520
Oh, I'm sorry, we're new talking.

10
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.520
I wasn't listening. Shannon, enough.

11
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.520
We were just trying to be polite.

12
00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.520
You know, we were all friends once.

13
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.520
I think I'd have standards.

14
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.520
I don't listen to her. Nobody wants to be friends with her, anyone.

15
00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.520
Shannon, you're getting too full of yourself.

16
00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.520
What's it because she has a rich sugar daddy to support her?

17
00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.109
Oh, what? What did you say?

18
00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:04.109
Ladies, ladies, ladies.

19
00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:06.109
Uh, and Shannon.

20
00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:08.109
Um, it's time for me to shine.

21
00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:10.109
Who are you playing?

22
00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:13.109
Some boy, some rundown score.

23
00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:15.109
He hasn't got shit on me though.

24
00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:19.810
Oh, Ricky, you're amazing.

25
00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.810
Shannon, so who do you think will win today?

26
00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:28.099
Oh, my God.

27
00:01:28.099 --> 00:01:31.099
Is that this guy that's playing against Ricky?
