00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:57.829
Ricky's dress! Ricky's dress! Ricky's dress! Ricky's dress!

2
00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:02.829
Ricky lost so badly. I thought he and Johnny were on the same level, but that was you leaving.

3
00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:05.829
Ricky is a side character compared to Johnny.

4
00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:10.829
If even Sean has moved on, remember how say she was with Ricky? Absolutely she was.

5
00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:13.829
Well, good thing Johnny won't show him the time of day.

6
00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:16.829
You sure about that? How quickly?

7
00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:23.109
It has a sugar daddy. It's revolting to even think about.

8
00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:30.400
What did you just say, Nancy?

9
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.400
Can you give me a bottle of water, please?

10
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.099
What a good job! Thank you.

11
00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:40.420
Yeah. I think I twisted my wrist early.

12
00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:59.459
Do you mind holding water for me? Do you mind holding the bottle for me?

13
00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:05.730
Yeah, of course.

14
00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.729
I am going to get some thanks for your wrist.

15
00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:09.729
Thank you.

16
00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:27.699
So, you must be Johnny. I hope you're not thinking of dating Shannon. She already has a sugar daddy.

17
00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:32.050
Shut up. Why are you being so pathetic?

18
00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:38.050
Don't be mad at Nancy. She's just concerned that you're being deceived.

19
00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:43.050
We're all friends with Shannon and we're worried she's going down the wrong path.

20
00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.050
She won't listen to us and maybe she can listen to you.

21
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:51.050
So, you think that being friends is what, spreading rumors about it.

22
00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.050
I don't know about you, but I think that makes you a pretty bad friend.

23
00:02:54.050 --> 00:03:02.050
No, no, no. It's not like that. We're genuinely concerned about Shannon and since she's chasing after you, you figured she might listen to you.

24
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:14.099
What? She's pursuing me.

25
00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:17.099
Isn't it obvious she acted like this with Brittany?

26
00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:27.430
Right, okay. Thanks for telling me, I guess, but you're wrong about one thing. I'm pursuing her.

27
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:37.360
What? I don't understand. Why does he like Shannon? She has a...

28
00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.360
She has a stupid daddy.

29
00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:45.680
Fine. If you want second-hand goods, then by all means, pursue her.

30
00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:51.340
Oh, baby! I did. Now say that again.

31
00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.460
I did. So I thought, no apologies.

32
00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:01.460
Are you itching for another 20-mile run, Nancy?

33
00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:07.460
You know, she's not completely wrong. Me and everyone saw you passing me before.

34
00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:12.460
Ricky, I was so blind before, but you mean nothing to me.

35
00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:15.750
Do you really want to be with Johnny?

36
00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.750
And I'm obsessed with you. What does it matter if I'm with Johnny or not?

37
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:25.810
Shannon, I'll give you a second chance. You be my girlfriend.

38
00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:31.730
What makes you think you're so important?

39
00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:37.560
You're with Karen. I mean, do you not care how she feels when you say these things to me?

40
00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:45.019
Shannon, I will ruin you in front of the principal and the board members.

41
00:04:45.019 --> 00:04:57.519
Karen! You have completely crossed the line this time. I will never forgive you for this.

42
00:04:57.519 --> 00:05:07.699
I don't care about your forgiveness, you piece of shit.

43
00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:19.389
And so what now? She's all yours. First smart move you've made all day.

44
00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:24.980
Hey, the wrist.

45
00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:28.980
Yeah, it's all right. I'm glad I didn't have to punch that chair.

46
00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:34.689
Hey, what's wrong?

47
00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:38.689
Oh, it was just that thing you saw earlier.

48
00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:41.810
Which thing?

49
00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:45.810
Um, it was about you wanting to chase me.

50
00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:52.379
Oh, well, I mean, technically the word I used was pursued right now.

51
00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:57.089
Well, do you want to know if I want to be pursued?

52
00:05:57.089 --> 00:05:58.180
Obviously.

53
00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:02.079
All right, Mr. Wonder. I'm hungry.

54
00:06:02.079 --> 00:06:05.079
So, I'm going to go to the cafeteria to get some food.

55
00:06:05.079 --> 00:06:08.329
You want to come with?

56
00:06:08.329 --> 00:06:11.329
Technically, that wasn't an answer.

57
00:06:11.329 --> 00:06:15.540
Karen! Karen!

58
00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:17.699
Hey, Karen!

59
00:06:17.699 --> 00:06:21.660
Hey, don't be upset with me.

60
00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:27.110
Why does Shannon get to be chased by Johnny while I'm stuck with this nobody?

61
00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:28.750
Hey!

62
00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:31.750
Karen only said those things to Shannon to calm her down.

63
00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:34.750
All right, I'm not giving her a second chance.

64
00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:37.980
I know. I was just feeling down.

65
00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:43.579
Come on. Let's get out of here. Get food or something.

66
00:06:43.579 --> 00:06:45.579
You can get whatever you want.

67
00:06:45.579 --> 00:06:48.600
So, a steak dinner?

68
00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:49.600
Whatever you want.

69
00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.699
Okay, I'm not holding back then.

70
00:06:51.699 --> 00:06:55.870
Sit here at my apartment.

71
00:06:55.870 --> 00:07:06.259
You know, they're long gone.

72
00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:08.259
You're still holding off the beer left.

73
00:07:09.259 --> 00:07:14.730
What? You don't want me holding your arm?

74
00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:16.730
I thought you were pursuing me.

75
00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:20.079
I am. I am pursuing you.

76
00:07:20.079 --> 00:07:21.910
You don't believe me?

77
00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:24.490
I am.

78
00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:26.490
I never said I don't believe you.

79
00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:30.740
And do I have permission to pursue you?

80
00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:34.740
Johnny, that's a little straightforward. I don't know what to say.

81
00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:37.740
I guess I'll take that as a rest.

82
00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:42.189
Hey, at your school award, Shannon, this week,

83
00:07:42.189 --> 00:07:44.189
I'm going to be there.

84
00:07:44.189 --> 00:07:46.189
And now you have a special gift for me.

85
00:07:46.189 --> 00:07:49.350
He's not planning to confess to me on that day, is he?

86
00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:52.350
In front of the whole school, it's too high profile.

87
00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:54.350
Way too high profile.

88
00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:58.350
I'm in a tutor room so far that you make top three.

89
00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:03.350
And then you're going to have to give a speech in front of all those jerks who are meaning to you.

90
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:07.350
And they're not going to have no choice but to see just how brilliant you are.

91
00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:11.470
That's a lot of confidence for that.

92
00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:14.470
That was the gift you were going to give me?

93
00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:19.360
I have the confidence.

94
00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:27.709
Also, I think you should stay away from the tracks and I've done a bit of investigating and none of them.

95
00:08:27.709 --> 00:08:30.509
I know.

96
00:08:30.509 --> 00:08:35.669
In my previous life, that father and son scumbad do a whirlwind to me.

97
00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:38.700
In this life, I'm going to send them to hell.

98
00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:47.480
Hey, didn't you say you were going to treat me to something to help?

99
00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:48.480
Yes.

100
00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:53.480
Today, whatever a super teeny or Johnny wants, it's all me.

101
00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:54.700
Let's go.

102
00:08:54.700 --> 00:09:06.679
Look at that.

103
00:09:06.679 --> 00:09:07.679
So shameless.

104
00:09:07.679 --> 00:09:09.000
Look at that.

105
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:21.250
Oh, hi, are you always running after her?

106
00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:26.419
Let go of your honey.

107
00:09:26.419 --> 00:09:29.419
What is your relationship with Johnny Wonder?

108
00:09:29.419 --> 00:09:34.500
You two being together this whole time?

109
00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:39.559
You two being together this whole time?

110
00:09:39.559 --> 00:09:40.559
No.

111
00:09:40.559 --> 00:09:41.559
I wish.

112
00:09:41.559 --> 00:09:43.559
But Johnny Wonder is so pure.

113
00:09:43.559 --> 00:09:47.590
I'm afraid if I don't take things one step at a time, I'll scare them off.

114
00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:49.590
I don't believe you.

115
00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:53.590
You are lying to me.

116
00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:57.590
You two little study sessions.

117
00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:00.590
What are you actually doing?

118
00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:03.620
It is not that kind of person.

119
00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:04.620
Fine.

120
00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:09.070
I mean, I was serious about caring before.

121
00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:10.070
I've been alone.

122
00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:12.139
I'm serious about you.

123
00:10:12.139 --> 00:10:15.490
You're just upset seeing me with Johnny.

124
00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:16.490
Thank you.

125
00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:18.129
Yes.

126
00:10:18.129 --> 00:10:24.289
Every time you look at me, you light up like a ball of joy.

127
00:10:24.289 --> 00:10:35.909
I never once have you ever looked at me like that.

128
00:10:35.909 --> 00:10:37.679
Doesn't it?

129
00:10:37.679 --> 00:10:39.679
I used to feel pain there too.

130
00:10:39.679 --> 00:10:41.840
Ricky, right?

131
00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:42.840
He's new.

132
00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:43.840
Everything.

133
00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:46.840
Just to get confused and murdered and I will never.

134
00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:51.029
I'll despair and pain again.

135
00:10:51.029 --> 00:10:58.460
Everything that I've done to you is just the beginning.

136
00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:02.460
And it's just going to get worse day by day.

137
00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:07.720
Murder?

138
00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.720
What are you talking about, Shannon?

139
00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:12.720
I've never abused you once.

140
00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:14.720
You look fine and well to me.

141
00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:20.049
Get off of me.

142
00:11:20.049 --> 00:11:22.049
I've got you so much.

143
00:11:22.049 --> 00:11:24.049
Did you listen to her?

144
00:11:24.049 --> 00:11:27.259
Get off of her.

145
00:11:27.259 --> 00:11:29.490
Johnny, wonder?

146
00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:31.490
This is none of your business.

147
00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:33.490
I'm talking to Shannon right now.

148
00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:36.610
You know, Shannon said, get off of her.

149
00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:40.669
Were you going to do something about it?

150
00:11:40.669 --> 00:11:43.769
Were you going to hit me?

151
00:11:43.769 --> 00:11:49.610
Why don't we let shit?

152
00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:51.610
You fucking hit me.

153
00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:53.610
Yeah, I hit you.

154
00:11:53.610 --> 00:11:55.610
You shouldn't get his hand started touching me.

155
00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:59.429
But you know what?

156
00:11:59.429 --> 00:12:01.429
I was going to use you as a toy.

157
00:12:01.429 --> 00:12:03.429
And torture you until you went insane.

158
00:12:03.429 --> 00:12:06.750
Do not get near me and Johnny.

159
00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:15.909
Let's go.

160
00:12:15.909 --> 00:12:18.909
Shannon, you ruined my relationship with Ricky.

161
00:12:18.909 --> 00:12:20.909
I'm going to make you pay.

162
00:12:20.909 --> 00:12:24.909
In front of everyone, I'm going to expose you and your sugar daddy.

163
00:12:24.909 --> 00:12:26.909
I'm going to ruin you.

164
00:12:26.909 --> 00:12:31.669
Well, that was embarrassing.

165
00:12:31.669 --> 00:12:33.669
I'm sorry you had to see that again.

166
00:12:33.669 --> 00:12:36.669
Shannon, I'm sorry that I wasn't there to help you.

167
00:12:36.669 --> 00:12:37.669
If he hadn't heard that.

168
00:12:37.669 --> 00:12:41.179
No, I will not let him hurt me a second time.

169
00:12:41.179 --> 00:12:43.379
Shannon, he hurt you before?

170
00:12:43.379 --> 00:12:46.620
I'm so embarrassed that I haven't been there for you.

171
00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:49.620
I want you to know that from now on, I will always protect you.

172
00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:52.620
No, no, it's not your fault.

173
00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:56.490
It was my own foolishness.

174
00:12:56.490 --> 00:12:58.940
Thanks, Johnny.

175
00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:02.830
I just had a really bad dream.

176
00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:06.830
In another lifetime, Ricky killed me.

177
00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:09.789
But I woke up.

178
00:13:09.789 --> 00:13:13.210
And in that dream was I.

179
00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:15.659
Yeah, yeah, you were.

180
00:13:15.659 --> 00:13:21.820
You actually came at the end.

181
00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:23.820
And then?

182
00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:26.139
And then...

183
00:13:26.139 --> 00:13:28.139
Maybe I should just tell you that at the party.

184
00:13:28.139 --> 00:13:32.139
Oh, actually, I can't believe I almost forgot to congratulate.

185
00:13:32.139 --> 00:13:36.139
Your school's outstanding student representative award.

186
00:13:36.139 --> 00:13:38.139
That is amazing, Shannon.

187
00:13:38.139 --> 00:13:40.139
You really deserved this.

188
00:13:40.139 --> 00:13:42.649
Well, I couldn't have done it without you.

189
00:13:42.649 --> 00:13:44.649
Such a great tutor.

190
00:13:44.649 --> 00:13:48.649
Which, by the way, I got you a gift as well.

191
00:13:48.649 --> 00:13:52.649
Oh, I guess now I'm actually excited for the award ceremony.

192
00:13:52.649 --> 00:13:54.649
It's a good one.

193
00:13:54.649 --> 00:14:06.149
Professor, why is Shannon the outstanding student representative for this year's award ceremony?

194
00:14:06.149 --> 00:14:08.149
It should be me.

195
00:14:08.149 --> 00:14:12.149
It should have been you for years, but you insisted on giving it to Ricky.

196
00:14:12.149 --> 00:14:14.149
Well, he deserved it.

197
00:14:14.149 --> 00:14:16.730
You deserved it.

198
00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:20.730
But you insisted on giving it to that boy.

199
00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:24.730
Meanwhile, Shannon has been making great progress.

200
00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:31.340
And her progress is an inspiration to all the other students.

201
00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:33.340
How could they do this to me? It should be.

202
00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:35.340
I'm sorry.

203
00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:39.340
You've had the opportunity for the honors, but you kept turning it down.

204
00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:43.340
You can talk to the principal if you want, but it won't change anything.

205
00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:45.659
I'm sorry.

206
00:14:45.659 --> 00:14:49.129
I can't understand.

207
00:14:49.129 --> 00:14:53.850
Thank you for your time.

208
00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:55.850
Shannon stole Ricky from me.

209
00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:57.850
Now she's stealing my honor.

210
00:14:57.850 --> 00:15:08.490
What else is she going to take from me?

211
00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:10.490
That's Shannon and her sugar daddy.

212
00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:12.490
What?

213
00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:18.940
I'm going to expose you in front of everyone, Shannon.

214
00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:20.940
Don't get ready.

215
00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:22.940
I mean, you'd hear your speech.

216
00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:24.940
I'm also excited to hear your speech, Dad.

217
00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:26.940
I'm a board member.

218
00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:28.940
Oh, I'm nervous.

219
00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:30.940
I love you, sweetheart.

220
00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:40.299
Let's welcome today's student representative for the award ceremony, Shannon Clark.

221
00:15:40.299 --> 00:15:54.620
I'm Shannon Clark.

222
00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:56.620
Today's student representative.

223
00:15:56.620 --> 00:16:00.620
And I am so grateful to be giving this speech first.

224
00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:05.049
I have something I'd like to report.

225
00:16:05.049 --> 00:16:18.120
Come to my attention.

226
00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:24.120
That's Shannon Clark is not qualified to be this year's outstanding student representative

227
00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:30.580
because she's selling herself to an older man.

228
00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:41.639
I'd like to expose Shannon before she can tarnish this school's reputation any more than she already has.

229
00:16:41.639 --> 00:16:43.639
She's selling herself.

230
00:16:43.639 --> 00:16:50.639
Her grades are unnaturally improving and she creates her fellow classmates with malice and with cruelty.

231
00:16:50.639 --> 00:16:52.639
No, no, she's lying.

232
00:16:52.639 --> 00:16:54.639
If you cream, I'm being kept.

233
00:16:54.639 --> 00:16:56.639
Show your evidence.

234
00:16:56.639 --> 00:17:02.960
If you're going to slander me in front of the entire school without any proof, you can sue you.

235
00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:05.500
Who says I don't have any proof?

236
00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:07.500
Everyone.

237
00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:09.500
Please look at the big screen behind me.

238
00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:21.920
God, the sugar daddy rumors are true.

239
00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:23.920
Sorry.

240
00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:27.920
I think these students have absolutely no idea what's going on.

241
00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:29.920
I'm really sorry.

242
00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:31.920
No need. No need.

243
00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:33.920
I want to see what these imbeciles think that they can accomplish.

244
00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:39.920
See, this is the evidence called Karen.

245
00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:41.920
This is the man you claim is keeping you?

246
00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:44.180
Yeah.

247
00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:48.180
Shannon, what do you have to say for yourself?

248
00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:51.500
Shannon, how are you doing?

249
00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:54.849
So old and ugly.

250
00:17:54.849 --> 00:17:57.849
How can you bring yourself to do it?

251
00:17:57.849 --> 00:18:00.579
Oh, Karen.

252
00:18:00.579 --> 00:18:04.579
Who says that this man is old and ugly?

253
00:18:04.579 --> 00:18:10.579
If anything, I think he's the most handsome man in the entire world.

254
00:18:10.579 --> 00:18:12.579
Well, second most handsome.

255
00:18:12.579 --> 00:18:14.579
Hey, will I talk to second?

256
00:18:14.579 --> 00:18:20.579
Shannon, you really have no shame, huh?

257
00:18:20.579 --> 00:18:22.579
Being kept by this man, fine.

258
00:18:22.579 --> 00:18:24.579
Take his money.

259
00:18:24.579 --> 00:18:26.579
But calling him handsome?

260
00:18:26.579 --> 00:18:31.099
She's in love with her sugar daddy.

261
00:18:31.099 --> 00:18:39.740
Shannon, you really have no shame.

262
00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:42.740
Could you at least try to act embarrassed?

263
00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:47.940
I'm shameless because I think this man is handsome.

264
00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:50.329
I was in love with you.

265
00:18:50.329 --> 00:18:53.329
You're a disgrace to every student here.

266
00:18:53.329 --> 00:18:56.460
You're a humiliation, Karen.

267
00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:59.460
If anyone is going to be humiliated today, it's going to be true.

268
00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:03.460
Oh, since you admitted it, why don't you apologize to everyone?

269
00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:06.460
Drop out and maybe then you can salvage some dignity.

270
00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:08.460
Oh, you're too kind.

271
00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:10.460
That's why people walk all over you.

272
00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:15.460
In my opinion, she should be expelled from the school.

273
00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:22.380
Karen, I would like to know, told you I have a sugar daddy.

274
00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:27.819
You have the photos, so someone must have tipped you off.

275
00:19:27.819 --> 00:19:29.819
Do you have any witnesses?

276
00:19:29.819 --> 00:19:30.819
Of course.

277
00:19:30.819 --> 00:19:32.819
I have a witness.

278
00:19:32.819 --> 00:19:35.890
Oh, Ricky Traps told us.

279
00:19:35.890 --> 00:19:37.890
And we all believe Ricky.

280
00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:40.430
Ricky, tell him what you told us.

281
00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:46.690
Isn't it true?

282
00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:47.690
Come on, Ricky.

283
00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:48.690
Say something.

284
00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:51.009
Is it true or not?

285
00:19:51.009 --> 00:19:52.009
No.

286
00:19:52.009 --> 00:19:54.009
Is this the witness?

287
00:19:54.009 --> 00:19:56.009
Come on, Ricky.

288
00:19:56.009 --> 00:19:59.009
Tell everyone the relationship I have with this man.

289
00:19:59.009 --> 00:20:01.490
Pictures are worried.

290
00:20:01.490 --> 00:20:03.490
I don't even know what I'm looking at.

291
00:20:03.490 --> 00:20:07.490
Ricky, this is your last chance to tell everyone everything.

292
00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:11.779
And Shannon, why are you dragging Ricky into this?

293
00:20:11.779 --> 00:20:14.779
Sorry about enough, that you lost your shame.

294
00:20:14.779 --> 00:20:19.029
Why are you trying to drag another person down with you?

295
00:20:19.029 --> 00:20:23.220
Shannon, I know you've always liked Ricky, but you don't have to make him lie for you.

296
00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:24.220
Karen is right.

297
00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:29.640
Shannon, it's an embarrassment to be your classmate.

298
00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:33.769
If you had any self-respect, you would drop out.

299
00:20:33.769 --> 00:20:35.769
You want me to drop out?

300
00:20:35.769 --> 00:20:38.859
What do you all say, classmates?

301
00:20:38.859 --> 00:20:45.279
If she doesn't drop out, do we really want this scum to be in our school?

302
00:20:45.279 --> 00:20:47.279
Drop out.

303
00:20:47.279 --> 00:20:48.279
Drop out.

304
00:20:48.279 --> 00:20:49.279
Drop out.

305
00:20:49.279 --> 00:20:50.599
Drop out.

306
00:20:50.599 --> 00:20:51.599
Drop out.

307
00:20:51.599 --> 00:20:53.180
Let me know.

308
00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:54.180
Shut up.

309
00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:57.779
Trying to put you into this bullshit.

310
00:20:57.779 --> 00:21:08.720
Dean, please stand up for us.

311
00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:13.720
All the evidence points towards Shannon having a sugar daddy and being a pulley.

312
00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:14.720
Just kidding.

313
00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:15.720
Take her out.

314
00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:16.720
She's a disgrace.

315
00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:17.720
A disgrace.

316
00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:18.720
Yes.

317
00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:21.720
Especially with the new board member attending today's ceremony.

318
00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:26.720
You have to deal with Shannon properly in order to maintain the school's reputation.

319
00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:27.720
Indeed.

320
00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:30.779
Improper behavior must be punished.

321
00:21:30.779 --> 00:21:32.880
So tell me, how do you think I should handle it?

322
00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:35.880
I mean, as Dean, what should I do?

323
00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:37.880
Shannon, did you hear that?

324
00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:40.880
The Dean is finally going to deal with you.

325
00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:44.880
Dean, I suggest you expel her from the school.

326
00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:47.230
No one wants her here.

327
00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:49.490
Yes, you're sure?

328
00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:51.490
And you're in your final year of university.

329
00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:57.490
If I were to expel someone from your class, they wouldn't receive a diploma.

330
00:21:57.490 --> 00:22:00.490
And all the hard work over the last three years would just be for nothing.

331
00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:01.490
So what?

332
00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:05.549
That's the price she pays for doing something wrong.

333
00:22:05.549 --> 00:22:08.549
She should be severely punished.

334
00:22:08.549 --> 00:22:11.549
As an example, for others.

335
00:22:11.549 --> 00:22:16.549
Otherwise, we would have to call this place a brothel instead of a university.

336
00:22:16.549 --> 00:22:23.740
So, you will agree that improper conduct causes harm to other students.

337
00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:27.740
And tarnishes the university's reputation, you should be expelled.

338
00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:33.170
Is that right?

339
00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:34.170
No doubt about it.

340
00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:37.170
This disgusting person should be expelled.

341
00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:38.170
What do you think, Shannon?

342
00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:41.650
A clear conscience is a sure card.

343
00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:46.650
Dean, maybe let's not expel Shannon right away.

344
00:22:46.650 --> 00:22:55.650
Maybe she admits that she made a mistake in front of everyone and gets down on her knees and begs.

345
00:22:55.650 --> 00:22:57.650
Maybe the students will forgive her.

346
00:22:57.650 --> 00:23:02.650
Wait, you want me to kneel down and beg for forgiveness?

347
00:23:02.650 --> 00:23:07.059
Well, wouldn't that harm my reputation even more?

348
00:23:07.059 --> 00:23:11.059
Shannon, would you just apologize so we could end this already?

349
00:23:11.059 --> 00:23:13.059
Just can go back to the way they used to be.

350
00:23:13.059 --> 00:23:14.059
Apologize.

351
00:23:14.059 --> 00:23:19.059
Ricky, do you want to tell everyone what's going on?

352
00:23:19.059 --> 00:23:21.059
And who this man means to me?

353
00:23:21.059 --> 00:23:23.059
Or what are you?

354
00:23:23.059 --> 00:23:26.059
Do you want to reveal to everyone who you truly are?

355
00:23:26.059 --> 00:23:29.059
What does my identity have to do with you?

356
00:23:29.059 --> 00:23:31.059
Looks like you're too scared to say it.

357
00:23:31.059 --> 00:23:32.059
Okay.

358
00:23:32.059 --> 00:23:33.059
I'm going to do it myself.

359
00:23:33.059 --> 00:23:38.059
Ladies and gentlemen, Ricky Trax is the son of a chauffeur.

360
00:23:38.059 --> 00:23:40.480
My chauffeur.

361
00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:45.740
He's just a poor boy trying to spend my money to look cool for you idiots.

362
00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:50.680
Ricky is the son of a driver?

363
00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:53.680
Shannon really did pay for his birthday party.

364
00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:56.680
And he lied by saying it was his card all along.

365
00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:58.680
Shannon, I'm so sick of your shit.

366
00:23:58.680 --> 00:23:59.680
I'm done giving you awards.

367
00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:01.680
I cannot tolerate any more.

368
00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:03.680
I've done everything that I get for you.

369
00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:04.680
I get caring for you.

370
00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:05.680
I've done so much.

371
00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:06.680
Hey, asshole.

372
00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:07.680
What?

373
00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:08.680
What?

374
00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:09.680
What?

375
00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:11.970
Hi.

376
00:24:11.970 --> 00:24:13.970
Did you just snoozing fucking hit me?

377
00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:14.970
Yeah.

378
00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:15.970
I did.

379
00:24:15.970 --> 00:24:16.970
What's this?

380
00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:19.970
Ricky Trax, my family, the Clark's practically raised you.

381
00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:22.970
And yet you are still an ungrateful little shit.

382
00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:24.970
Just like your father.

383
00:24:24.970 --> 00:24:29.730
That's Shannon's sugar daddy.

384
00:24:29.730 --> 00:24:31.730
He's a member of the board.

385
00:24:31.730 --> 00:24:34.269
What are you going to do?

386
00:24:34.269 --> 00:24:39.269
What's everyone going to think when they find out you're sleeping with a student?

387
00:24:39.269 --> 00:24:41.269
What's your family going to think?

388
00:24:41.269 --> 00:24:42.269
Karen, shut up.

389
00:24:42.269 --> 00:24:44.269
Do you even know who he is?

390
00:24:44.269 --> 00:24:45.269
Don't don't care who he is.

391
00:24:45.269 --> 00:24:47.269
He's sleeping with a student.

392
00:24:47.269 --> 00:24:48.269
He should be in jail.

393
00:24:48.269 --> 00:24:49.269
Just shut up.

394
00:24:49.269 --> 00:24:51.269
Shannon, come here.

395
00:24:51.269 --> 00:24:56.930
Move away from me, creepy little girl.

396
00:24:56.930 --> 00:24:58.930
Let me introduce myself.

397
00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:01.930
I am Reginald Francis Alloysius Clark.

398
00:25:01.930 --> 00:25:04.930
And I am the newest member here at the Roses Academy.

399
00:25:04.930 --> 00:25:06.930
I'm also the head of the Alumni Association.

400
00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:10.930
As well, I am on the state board of business affairs.

401
00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:14.960
This beautiful young woman is my daughter, Shannon.

402
00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:18.960
And I have loved, cherished and protected her since the day she was born.

403
00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:25.960
And yet some of you think it is appropriate to humiliate, insult and damage her reputation.

404
00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:28.960
Let me tell you, this is your worst day.

405
00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:29.960
No, no, no.

406
00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:31.960
He's got to be an ambassador.

407
00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:33.960
Karen, stop talking.

408
00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:35.960
What is going on here?

409
00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:36.960
What is happening?

410
00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:38.960
What is happening here?

411
00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:44.960
Earlier, some of you students were talking about those who have questionable morals that would

412
00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:48.960
willfully hurt another student and damage the reputation of this school.

413
00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:49.960
That they should be expelled.

414
00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:50.960
Is it that correct, Dean?

415
00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:51.960
Yes.

416
00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:52.960
Very well.

417
00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:54.960
We'll do a protocol in place then.

418
00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:59.960
Those who have spread these vicious lies and rumors will be expelled.

419
00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:00.960
Correct?

420
00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:05.960
Mr. Clark, sir, it's not like that.

421
00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:08.960
I didn't know that Shannon was your daughter.

422
00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:10.960
I did not do it on purpose.

423
00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:12.960
You did not do it on purpose.

424
00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:16.079
You mean you didn't know.

425
00:26:16.079 --> 00:26:21.079
To every student who participated in bullying my daughter, you will never work in this city.

426
00:26:21.079 --> 00:26:27.079
And as for the ringleaders, Karen, Ricky, Yancy, I suggest you pull out your cheap little

427
00:26:27.079 --> 00:26:32.819
phones and book flights the hell out of this city and move far, far away.

428
00:26:32.819 --> 00:26:33.819
Oh, it's over.

429
00:26:33.819 --> 00:26:34.819
I'm finished.

430
00:26:34.819 --> 00:26:41.819
Mr. Clark, even if the rumors about you aren't real, it doesn't change the fact that Shannon

431
00:26:41.819 --> 00:26:45.819
used your money to keep Johnny as a boy toy.

432
00:26:45.819 --> 00:26:48.819
Are you saying my daughter brought Johnny?

433
00:26:48.819 --> 00:26:49.819
Johnny Wonder?

434
00:26:49.819 --> 00:26:50.819
Yeah.

435
00:26:50.819 --> 00:26:53.819
Yeah, don't you see the way she dangles all over him?

436
00:26:53.819 --> 00:26:59.819
We're suggesting that the Clark family has the money-powered influence to buy Johnny Wonder.

437
00:26:59.819 --> 00:27:01.819
Do you know who he is?

438
00:27:01.819 --> 00:27:02.819
What?

439
00:27:02.819 --> 00:27:03.819
Pay attention.

440
00:27:03.819 --> 00:27:05.819
You've heard of the Boy Prince.

441
00:27:05.819 --> 00:27:08.819
Air to the biggest conglomerate in the city.

442
00:27:08.819 --> 00:27:13.819
The family that owns 99.9% of every building in the city.

443
00:27:13.819 --> 00:27:15.849
That is Johnny Wonder.

444
00:27:15.849 --> 00:27:17.849
He is the Boy Prince.

445
00:27:17.849 --> 00:27:18.849
Johnny!

446
00:27:18.849 --> 00:27:21.039
Johnny is Boy Wonder.

447
00:27:21.039 --> 00:27:24.039
That's not, that's just not-

448
00:27:24.039 --> 00:27:28.039
And with that due respect, he owns the city, Karen.

449
00:27:28.039 --> 00:27:29.039
No.

450
00:27:29.039 --> 00:27:31.200
No, that's not possible.

451
00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:36.480
No, I don't believe.

452
00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:39.640
You two are both as good as finished.

453
00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:41.640
Whether or not you believe it.

454
00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:42.640
There's no difference at all.

455
00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:43.640
Mr. Dean?

456
00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:44.930
If you please.

457
00:27:44.930 --> 00:27:46.930
You're out of here.

458
00:27:46.930 --> 00:27:47.930
No, no, no, no.

459
00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:48.930
Don't!

460
00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:49.930
Don't!

461
00:27:49.930 --> 00:27:50.930
Stop!

462
00:27:50.930 --> 00:28:13.960
Mr. Clark, those two have proven themselves to be incredibly malicious people who go to any

463
00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:15.960
length it takes to hurt Shannon.

464
00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:18.960
I request you allow me to deal with them my own way.

465
00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:20.019
Of course.

466
00:28:20.019 --> 00:28:21.019
Thank you.

467
00:28:21.019 --> 00:28:26.460
Shannon, I told you that I would give you a gift.

468
00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:28.519
With this sound.

469
00:28:28.519 --> 00:28:33.420
Oh, hold on.

470
00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:38.450
Johnny, I'm so grateful to have you in my life.

471
00:28:38.450 --> 00:28:47.339
And when I first met you, I felt mixed emotions of gratitude, but I couldn't help but fall in love with you.

472
00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:53.789
We've already missed on so much time, and I don't want to waste any more, so.

473
00:28:53.789 --> 00:28:55.789
Let's get married right away.

474
00:28:55.789 --> 00:28:58.819
Wait, you are the one proposing to me?

475
00:28:58.819 --> 00:29:02.809
Shannon, I have to tell you something.

476
00:29:02.809 --> 00:29:06.609
I know that I missed you once before.

477
00:29:06.609 --> 00:29:11.309
You know, I lost you in a previous life.

478
00:29:11.309 --> 00:29:14.309
But in this life, I promise I will always be with you.

479
00:29:14.309 --> 00:29:16.309
In this life, you will never suffer.

480
00:29:16.309 --> 00:29:19.109
You remember too.

481
00:29:20.589 --> 00:29:25.819
In my next life, I will make sure you are the happiest woman in the world.

482
00:29:25.819 --> 00:29:29.619
It's really nice to see you again.

483
00:29:29.619 --> 00:29:32.619
This car is a pleasure to see you too.

484
00:29:32.619 --> 00:29:35.809
Do you want to know if I want to be pursued?

485
00:29:35.809 --> 00:29:37.940
It's a second time.

486
00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:39.940
Shall he hurt you before?

487
00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:41.940
I'm so embarrassed that I haven't been there for you.

488
00:29:41.940 --> 00:30:00.269
I want you to know that from now on, I will always protect you.

489
00:30:01.339 --> 00:30:04.339
Thank you, Universe, for the second chance.

490
00:30:04.339 --> 00:30:05.339
Oh, Heaven.

491
00:30:05.339 --> 00:30:11.369
Oh, Johnny, I can't wait to be with you in this life and in every other.
