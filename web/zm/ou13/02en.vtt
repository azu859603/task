00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
You're joking, right?

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.929
Tell you could find a wife.

3
00:00:04.929 --> 00:00:08.339
You'll be working around here as an office assistant.

4
00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:10.339
Wait, no, no, no, Dad, look.

5
00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:13.410
You just haven't given me enough time to find the right girl.

6
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.410
You've already had plenty of time.

7
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:35.079
My decision is fine.

8
00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:37.079
Just get the job, flirt with the CEO.

9
00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:43.590
I'll be over before you know it.

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.259
Hi, I'm Amy Clark.

11
00:00:46.259 --> 00:00:48.649
Here for my interview?

12
00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:55.719
Excuse me, would you happen to know where logistics is?
