1
00:00:08,619 --> 00:00:15,230
I made me clerk.

2
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:18,230
Wanna use some kind of Amish influencer?

3
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:20,359
No, sir.

4
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:22,359
I grew up in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, but I...

5
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:28,359
I'm not seeing anything that really isn't our line of business here, so...

6
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:31,359
Well, I think that I could help increase visibility.

7
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,359
It's kind of not a farmer's market, so...

8
00:00:34,359 --> 00:00:39,079
I'm not sure it's gonna work out for you.

9
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:49,909
Hey, Bob.

10
00:00:49,909 --> 00:00:50,909
Let me ask you something.

11
00:00:50,909 --> 00:00:54,259
Who's that girl getting interviewed in Hill's office?

12
00:00:54,259 --> 00:00:57,740
Yeah, that would be Amy Clark.

13
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:01,840
For some reason, I thought her name was Amelia.

14
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,900
Look, never mind. Just do me a favor.
