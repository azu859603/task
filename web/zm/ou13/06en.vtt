00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.929
Mr. Matthews, I just wanted to thank you for the opportunity.

2
00:00:05.929 --> 00:00:08.250
Look, Amy.

3
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.250
We got a corporate white party coming up here.

4
00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.250
That's the 28-year anniversary.

5
00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.250
Mr. Greer has requested a brand new suit.

6
00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.250
It's got to look amazing.

7
00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.250
And also, he wants to run down a really nice mansion for this day.

8
00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.250
So, you budget for this bad boy.

9
00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.250
50K.

10
00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.109
50K?

11
00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:32.109
I mean, I think all of this would cost at least 200K.

12
00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:34.109
No, no, no, I don't know what to do with that.

13
00:00:34.109 --> 00:00:35.109
Okay, this is your job.

14
00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:37.369
Figure it out.

15
00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:39.780
Don't look at me like that.

16
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:40.780
Take it.

17
00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.810
Go.

18
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:43.810
But that stuff's the new.

19
00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:59.060
Looks like someone got a large paycheck on their first day.

20
00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.060
Oh.

21
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.509
No, I wish.

22
00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:03.509
That's you.

23
00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:05.510
Over here.

24
00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.090
Such a pain in the ass.

25
00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.090
Yeah.
