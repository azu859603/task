1
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:15,580
Are you sure your boss isn't here?

2
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:20,579
Ah, don't worry. He's, uh, on a business trip to Europe.

3
00:00:20,579 --> 00:00:26,649
Anything that I should know about him.

4
00:00:26,649 --> 00:00:34,820
Can I say, he's, uh, pain in the ass?

5
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:43,380
Boring? He's loaded.

6
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:46,380
You know, nothing gets the heart pumping like the thrill of stealing.

7
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:55,719
When you're great. So, be my accomplice.

8
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:57,969
Sure.

9
00:00:57,969 --> 00:01:12,260
You know, I can't help but think.

10
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:17,250
Everyone has always treated me like garbage. Except for you.

11
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:25,530
The best compliment I've gotten in ages.

12
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:30,159
You know, you remind me of someone.

13
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:35,060
Yeah?

14
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,060
Saved my life a few years ago.

15
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:47,400
So now that you have $50,000, how do you want to spend it?

16
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,260
I had this dream once.
