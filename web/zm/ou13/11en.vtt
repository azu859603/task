00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:41.479
You have to wake up there someone at the door. What's going on? It's not your boss

2
00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:55.950
right? No. Hey I have a letter for Noah Christian Greer. Yep that's me. Thank you.

3
00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:14.689
You are no Greer. Just let me explain. You had plenty of time to tell me that

4
00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:22.540
you were CEO and yet you chose to lie to me. I'm actually not CEO anymore. My

5
00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:29.159
dad's being a total dick and won't give me my job back until I marry someone.

6
00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:37.750
Well that sucks for you I guess. Please don't go. I wanted this to change how we

7
00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:58.540
felt last night. Don't we just have a nice long spot eh? I'm Eli Anderson. Your

8
00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.579
mother is in asterisk critical condition. You should come asterisk to the hospital

9
00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:46.740
right away. She's stable for now but we're out of capacity today. She has to be

10
00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.099
transferred to a nearby clinic. I just sent the 50k that I have to the

11
00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:55.900
insurance company like 60 seconds ago. A record show that your two hundred and

12
00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:04.000
fifty thousand dollars overdue. We just can't be. She could die. She's staying. Your medical bills

13
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.819
are paid for. And get her to a better room for crying out loud. Yes. Understood Mr. Greer.

14
00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:25.180
The shareholders of this hospital. Make sure your mom gets the best treatment

15
00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:39.340
possible. I'll pay you back. Promise. Amy just wait up. I want to apologize for lying to you.

16
00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:50.870
I was just having some fun. Yeah well. No. Last night was not a game. You know

17
00:03:50.870 --> 00:04:08.680
it too. I actually really like you like a lot. Mom? She's coding in front of you. Mom? Mom please don't

18
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:23.860
leave me. She'll be okay. Trevor, mom is in the ICU. I'm sure they can save her. Yes I did but Trevor.

19
00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:43.269
Mary and newer Greer. The best doctor in the world taking care of her right now. She'll be fine.

20
00:04:43.269 --> 00:04:50.379
I just I don't know what I'm gonna do okay. I I don't want to be alone. No no hey.

21
00:04:50.379 --> 00:05:07.629
You're not gonna be alone. Be right by your side. Every step of the way. I guess I

22
00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:28.300
have no choice. Whoa. I gotta come from. You want to be the CEO right? We can make a trade.

23
00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:40.639
I mean I do want my job back. No you really don't have to. Look I just wanted to pay for the bills just to

24
00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:59.620
apologize for what I did. No it's it's the least that I can do it. Let's get married. She's

25
00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:04.259
stable again for now. We're gonna keep an ICU just to be safe. Okay can I see her

26
00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:08.939
now? Your mother needs some rest. I suggest that you come back tomorrow. We'll be

27
00:06:08.939 --> 00:06:24.720
watching her throughout the night. That's good news. I guess I'll leave this time again. Good

28
00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:28.560
morning here for a marriage certificate. We are. All right cool. First thing I just need

29
00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:44.589
your signatures. This is the big day. Monday. It's just to get my. You all are

30
00:06:44.589 --> 00:07:03.490
married. Enjoy your day. Thank you. So Mrs. Greer I want to give you the perfect

31
00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:08.769
wedding. I'm talking about a beautiful wedding dress. A boatload of champagne and

32
00:07:08.769 --> 00:07:37.769
a big old diamond ring. I owe you seriously. I not not so fast. There is a merger and

33
00:07:37.769 --> 00:07:42.529
acquisition deal going on for the Greer Corp. We need you to change that to a

34
00:07:42.529 --> 00:08:01.709
complete buyout. It was a wife now. Figure it's out. No you keep threatening her

35
00:08:01.709 --> 00:08:05.870
family but I'm starting to think you're just protecting yourself. I wouldn't

36
00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:20.600
doubt me. Happy now? Congratulations son. Who's the bride? It doesn't matter. Okay I

37
00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:30.339
got married. I want my job back. This kid. Find out who this Amy girl is. Want to know

38
00:08:30.339 --> 00:08:44.360
everything about it. Right away sir. Glad you guys can make it. All right. Mr.

39
00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:49.820
Matthews. I heard your team is in charge of finding the venue. How's that coming

40
00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:54.220
along? It's coming along very well. Thank you. I think I found the perfect

41
00:08:54.220 --> 00:09:03.940
location. He's earned. Quite beautiful. And you found this. Is that correct? Yes I

42
00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:09.919
did. Sure by myself. That's strange because I don't recall giving you permission

43
00:09:09.919 --> 00:09:18.860
to use my house as a venue. Amy. Oh my goodness. How could you steal pictures of

44
00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:27.139
Mr. Greer's house? Mr. Greer I am so sorry. She's new obviously and if you

45
00:09:27.139 --> 00:09:32.340
could please just forgive her. But I thought you said that. You're the one that found me.

46
00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:39.659
And not my wife. Well I think what I'm doing is taking one for the team as it were.

47
00:09:39.659 --> 00:09:44.620
It's alright. I think you're saying what? Since you're such a team player. Why don't you

48
00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:54.279
take this one for the team? You're fired. No Matthews. Effective immediately. Mr. Greer

49
00:09:54.279 --> 00:09:58.580
hold on a second. Let me explain to you why this happened. What are you doing here? You

50
00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:12.029
can leave now. That's taken care of. I'd like to officially announce that me and

51
00:10:12.029 --> 00:10:19.480
Amy Clark here are getting married. Okay. Okay. Also on that note we are also

52
00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:25.860
changing the theme of the party to a wedding. Everyone here is invited. Alright I'll see you

53
00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:38.889
then. I cannot believe that you just fired my boss like that. That asshole had it

54
00:10:38.889 --> 00:10:45.649
coming and I have to do right by my wife. So I was thinking since he don't have a

55
00:10:45.649 --> 00:10:53.820
boss anymore. I'd like to be my new secretary. Now that is an interesting

56
00:10:53.820 --> 00:11:01.620
proposition. Mr. Greer. Now you get triple this salary. Exclusive health benefits. Company

57
00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:32.980
car. A few other things. Can't wait for this one. Hi. One sec. Come in. I heard your wife

58
00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:39.779
works here now. I'd like to meet her. Yeah of course. Well obviously she's busy right

59
00:11:39.779 --> 00:11:47.090
now. Yeah you know Dan I'm really busy right now myself. So why don't you excuse me please.

60
00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:59.450
Alright. But I expect to meet her soon. Son may not seem like it. I want you to

61
00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:34.779
succeed. Actually I wasn't close enough. We have to go dress shopping. I've been so busy

62
00:12:34.779 --> 00:12:39.370
these past couple days. I literally haven't had time to even think about what I'm

63
00:12:39.370 --> 00:13:32.500
wearing for my wedding. Relax. Gotta cover. Observe the vest from me. Amy. Looks like

64
00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:47.639
he just saw a ghost. Congratulations Mr. and Mrs. Greer. Where are my manners? We

65
00:13:47.639 --> 00:13:53.740
haven't met yet. I'm Trevor Anderson. Your name doesn't ring a bell. Mind if I

66
00:13:53.740 --> 00:14:00.460
ask for you with? I'm with Holland Limited. Mr. Greer. Oh. Thought I invited the CEO. Mr.

67
00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:05.019
Kavanak could not make it. His million dollar mastiff got parvo. So he's been at

68
00:14:05.019 --> 00:14:10.299
the vet all week trying to save his investment. So I will be taking over the

69
00:14:10.299 --> 00:14:16.419
merger and acquisitions deal from this point forward. Just how I'm hearing about

70
00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:22.990
that. Alright well I guess we'll talk about at our meeting Mr. Anderson. Yes you

71
00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:46.620
will. You will. Congratulations again. I'm checking out your lavish lifestyle

72
00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:53.470
Amelia while your brother and your mother rot away in a shit hole. You are my

73
00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:58.230
only sister. We are family. Could you imagine if we had all this money? No.

74
00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:06.059
Get the hell out of here. Oh yeah you're tearing me apart here. Hey your hands off my

75
00:15:06.059 --> 00:15:16.110
wife. Oh yeah you're tearing me apart here. Hey get your hands off my wife. Oh relax

76
00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:21.350
Mr. Greer. I was just telling your wife how lucky she is to have a wonderful

77
00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:26.779
successful husband like you. Okay Mr. Anderson why don't we draw a line between

78
00:15:26.779 --> 00:15:33.419
a business and personal affairs. Well love too. Mr. Greer I'll be seeing you on

79
00:15:33.419 --> 00:15:52.460
Monday. I think he was just teasing. How do you two know each other again? Shit. Mr.

80
00:15:52.460 --> 00:16:10.799
Greer. Your father would like to see you. Alright I'll be back. Five million dollars

81
00:16:10.799 --> 00:16:20.820
of company money on a wedding. You serious? Is your way of congratulating me? Don't toy

82
00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:25.750
with me boy. Don't forget you're the one who asked for this. Besides it's like

83
00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:29.750
one-tenth of what you spent golfing with your mistress. Remember that? I

84
00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:38.159
remember because that's all you did when I had my three years ago. Her family could

85
00:16:38.159 --> 00:16:47.080
be drowning in debt. Don't talk about my wife like that. You didn't love yours? That

86
00:16:47.080 --> 00:17:08.799
gives you no right to talk about mine. I'm so sorry I lied to you now. Trevor stop. What's wrong

87
00:17:08.799 --> 00:17:21.759
Sis? I can't do this. It's not right. I can't do it anymore. You are kidding right? I

88
00:17:21.759 --> 00:18:24.079
really really wish you didn't say that. Just mommy back at the house. You're a little bitch.

89
00:18:24.079 --> 00:18:50.259
Saver strength. Give me tons of manners. It's your fucking throat. Mom get up. We're taking you

90
00:18:50.259 --> 00:19:01.549
to the hospital. What you did Amelia if it weren't for you mom wouldn't be in this

91
00:19:01.549 --> 00:19:07.990
state. Trevor you are my only brother. I mean you should be the man of this family. All

92
00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:12.589
you do is wreak havoc on us. I told you this would happen. Do not pin this on me.

93
00:19:12.589 --> 00:19:32.509
The information on this Amy Clark. There is an Amy Clark reporter missing in the area.

94
00:19:32.509 --> 00:19:50.700
Dig deeper. I'm so sorry for everything. Next time. Try to do what your brother asks okay.

95
00:19:50.700 --> 00:20:24.430
I can't throw it off. How does she go? Fucking kill Trevor Cindy. He's sweet.
