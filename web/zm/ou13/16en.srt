1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
With this new information, we'll have to change the proposition to a buyout.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:05,519
What hell no!

3
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:06,879
No, it's not part of the deal.

4
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:09,519
Three billion dollars for a buyout.

5
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:10,560
That's our best offer.

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,439
Our company's worth at least ten.

7
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:15,599
Not according to your internal documents.

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,760
No one wants to merge with a failing business.

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:26,109
I'm not, let me go talk to accounting and we'll have this meeting later, all right?

10
00:00:29,739 --> 00:00:32,219
My offer is good for one week, Mr. Greer,

11
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:36,380
but I would make a decision before that or else your secretary of a wife

12
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:39,020
might leave you when she figures out you don't have any money.

13
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:41,340
The hell did you just say?
