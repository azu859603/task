1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,860
Get ready.

2
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:21,469
Hey, so did you figure it out?

3
00:00:21,469 --> 00:00:25,760
Oh, yeah. Yeah, no. It was Stephanie. You're right.

4
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,760
Apparently she just typed some numbers in wrong on the Excel spreadsheet.

5
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,979
Hey, I totally get it. Excel can drive someone crazy.

6
00:00:33,979 --> 00:00:38,590
That's why I pay someone to do it. I thought it was my fault for a second.

7
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:45,280
No, come on. And I also

8
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,280
wanted to apologize for, you know, questioning you the other day.

9
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:55,070
It's all water under the bridge.
