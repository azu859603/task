1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,240
What?

2
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:03,779
I can't believe this.

3
00:00:03,779 --> 00:00:07,250
What did you say?

4
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:14,080
He came in here, and he asked what happened, and then...and then he sent me packing.

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,679
I've worked here for ten years.

6
00:00:18,679 --> 00:00:21,190
I have a baby to feed.

7
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:22,190
Okay.

8
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:25,320
Don't worry, I'm going to fix this right now.

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:34,320
Okay?

10
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,469
Hey you?

11
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:37,759
Is something wrong?

12
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:40,880
You fired Stephanie.

13
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,880
She's been with the company for ten years.

14
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,880
That kind of loyalty should mean something.

15
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:50,420
It does, but look, her mistake could have cost us billions.

16
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,939
Yeah, but everything worked out.

17
00:00:52,939 --> 00:00:55,939
You know, you'd have to be such a heartless tyrant.

18
00:00:55,939 --> 00:01:01,890
Look, I'm trying to run a company here, not a freaking charity.

19
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:03,890
Amy, where are you going?
