00:00:02,029 --> 00:00:09,939
Amy. Where are you going? Amy, wait.

2
00:00:09,939 --> 00:00:14,570
You know, some people just get everything handed to them,

3
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:17,629
and some people have to work their asses off for everything.

4
00:00:17,629 --> 00:00:19,949
Oh, real nice.

5
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:21,949
Where are you implying I'm spoiled now?

6
00:00:21,949 --> 00:00:24,339
Maybe I should just come clean.

7
00:00:24,339 --> 00:00:27,339
I can't let Stephanie lose her job because of something I did.

8
00:00:27,339 --> 00:00:29,660
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:31,660
I shouldn't have said that.

10
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:35,420
I have the right to say anything, especially when...

11
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:40,750
Okay, okay. I think I was being too harsh.

12
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,490
She can have her job back.
