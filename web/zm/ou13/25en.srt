Amy

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:12,509
You okay, I think I hit my head if you're still putting on a show whoever you are

3
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:18,570
You might want to think of an exit straight. Hey, don't talk about my wife like that. I have the real Emily Clark here with me

4
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:26,809
Care to see what she looks like

5
00:00:26,809 --> 00:00:33,590
Emily what the hell is she doing here? There's my imposter. I've been looking for my wallet all over. How dare you steal my shit

6
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:37,369
That car you think you are

7
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:40,090
Throwing around accusations like that

8
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:42,490
You can take my idea

9
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:44,520
But not my mom
