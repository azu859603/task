00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:05,839
Thank you. Is everything set with our clients?

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,919
Everything set.

3
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:14,050
Mr. Greer, our stock prices are dropping by half.

4
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:17,050
Somehow, our competitor got our client list

5
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:20,050
and is making them cancel their contracts.

6
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:22,050
Well, how the hell did this happen?

7
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:31,699
I think a server hack is not good.

8
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:36,259
Do you want to do this company, son?

9
00:00:36,259 --> 00:00:38,259
I'm trying to fix it!

10
00:00:38,259 --> 00:00:41,579
As they're just called, our stock price is now $0.

11
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:43,579
They wanted to lift us.
