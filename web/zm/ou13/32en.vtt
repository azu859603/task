00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.780
What do you mean?

2
00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:13.720
My name isn't Amy. I've been lying to you this whole time. I knew it. My real name is Amelia Anderson

3
00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:23.480
Trevor is my brother. That woman that knew brought to the house. That's Emily

4
00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:29.000
Trevor's ex-girlfriend.

5
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.240
Wanna save me? Now she's destroying everything I have.

6
00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.159
So what, you guys were in on this together the whole time?

7
00:00:36.159 --> 00:00:38.240
No, I was forced to do this, okay?

8
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.009
You asked me to marry you!

9
00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:47.469
For much to get close to me and tank my company.

10
00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:55.259
Trevor is involved with some really, really bad people. They threaten my family's lives.

11
00:00:55.259 --> 00:00:58.130
It's enough. Get out.

12
00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:07.420
I wasn't lying about that.

13
00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:08.379
Go!

14
00:01:08.379 --> 00:01:10.510
Are you deaf? Leave.

15
00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:24.420
Amelia, would you force papers to your house? I don't want to see you again.

16
00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.340
Well, sis.

17
00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:47.620
I don't understand you two are back together.

18
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.099
Newsflash, we have been together for a couple of months now, actually.

19
00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:55.120
You want to drop some more bombs on her babe?

20
00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.430
Isn't she like in the mafia or something?

21
00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:08.860
Oh, yeah, about that. There is no mafia. It was a scheme or an act, if you will, to make

22
00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:14.819
you believe that there was one. But Therian also paid actor.

23
00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.939
Well, an amateur actor, but I think he has what it takes, don't you? No.

24
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.870
Oh, big sis dropping at bombs now.

25
00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:28.960
You actually loved him?

26
00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:45.199
Fucking killer.

27
00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:46.639
Fucking monster, Trevor.

28
00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.080
You cut off mom's finger just for some fucking money?

29
00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.560
It is not just some money.

30
00:02:52.560 --> 00:03:01.620
When Noah sells his company, I'm going to get a hundred million dollars from it.

31
00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:02.740
I see what this is.

32
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.500
Here is all of your compensation for all the hard work you've done.

33
00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.860
Oh, and by the way, mom sold the place, so you better get the fuck out.

34
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.159
Come on, babe, let's go get some blow.

35
00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:36.419
By the way, I know what you did.

36
00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:39.340
Yeah? And what's that?

37
00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.620
Amelia told me everything.

38
00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:48.659
She did have a rough one.

39
00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:52.400
Too bad she's all beauty with no brains to back it up.

40
00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.069
Let me ask you something, Trevor.

41
00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:57.840
Do you really think you can get away with this?

42
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:00.780
I'm too good of a con man.

43
00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.379
I just stole your business from right under your nose and

44
00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:05.979
you didn't even see a comment.

45
00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:12.080
I hope you don't get too comfortable because I'm coming for you.

46
00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:17.759
Yeah? Well, you better have some salt on you because I'll be sipping teenies into heedy while you'll be

47
00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:21.660
begging daddy for money.

48
00:04:24.819 --> 00:04:26.420
Somebody's getting restless.

49
00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:27.300
You listen to me.

50
00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:29.100
You.

51
00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:34.189
I wouldn't worry too much about me.

52
00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:36.189
What I would worry about if I were you.

53
00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:39.550
It's not falling for bitches who spread their legs too easily for you.

54
00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:44.129
You like being the punching bag, Trevor?

55
00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:46.370
It's better than being the leg.

56
00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:47.329
Mr. Career.

57
00:04:47.329 --> 00:05:01.089
Amelia.

58
00:05:01.089 --> 00:05:07.680
Another scheme?

59
00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.310
I deserve this.

60
00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:15.579
I'm flat broke.

61
00:05:15.579 --> 00:05:18.699
I don't have a home and I'm caring for my mother who has a drug addiction.

62
00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:20.879
I'm glad you acknowledge your fate.

63
00:05:22.579 --> 00:05:26.100
If you're here to mock me, I get it.

64
00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.899
Both hate.

65
00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:31.310
Doesn't matter. Let's go.

66
00:05:31.310 --> 00:06:16.379
I remember saving somebody like three years ago in a car accident.

67
00:06:16.379 --> 00:06:21.420
After all this time, why didn't you tell me?

68
00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:27.730
I guess we both were very honest, huh?

69
00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:41.259
I know that saying I'm sorry doesn't mean God trust me when I say that I do love you.

70
00:06:41.259 --> 00:06:45.180
If I had known that my brother was just trying to get money, I never would have...

71
00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:47.100
No, no, don't do that.

72
00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:48.139
It's not your phone.

73
00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:48.860
Come back.

74
00:06:48.860 --> 00:07:14.019
I'll leave this.

75
00:07:14.019 --> 00:07:16.639
I'm gonna bring home tomorrow.

76
00:07:16.639 --> 00:07:18.480
Cockroaches to fill the swimming pool?

77
00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:22.129
My dad, before you say anything else, just let me explain.

78
00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:26.670
I'm really beginning to believe you're mentally challenged, son.

79
00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:29.149
Dad, she's the one who saved me in that accident.

80
00:07:29.149 --> 00:07:30.589
She deserves another chance.

81
00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:34.160
Our whole list.

82
00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:40.860
I'm not giving you any.

83
00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:44.220
In fact, I don't want you going anywhere near any of our family businesses.

84
00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:45.699
You know what, Dad?

85
00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:47.889
I don't need your money anymore.

86
00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:50.689
Because I'm taking back Greer Corp.

87
00:07:50.689 --> 00:07:51.089
Oh, yeah?

88
00:07:51.649 --> 00:07:54.420
Dying to see that happen.

89
00:07:54.420 --> 00:08:01.040
I'm so sorry.

90
00:08:02.579 --> 00:08:04.100
This is all my fault.

91
00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:08.589
How are you even gonna take it back?

92
00:08:08.589 --> 00:08:12.100
You the guy to plan?

93
00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:23.550
I didn't think you had the balls to reach out again.

94
00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:25.540
Yeah?

95
00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:27.060
Why wouldn't I?

96
00:08:27.759 --> 00:08:30.879
You know, you did tell me to confine you when I had concrete evidence, and well,

97
00:08:31.439 --> 00:08:32.320
now I do.

98
00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:40.509
I stole your company from my nose.

99
00:08:40.509 --> 00:08:41.789
Do something, Trevor?

100
00:08:41.789 --> 00:08:42.429
It's too late.

101
00:08:43.149 --> 00:08:44.029
Cops are on the way.

102
00:08:45.179 --> 00:08:46.620
And there's a line-ass hole.

103
00:08:47.500 --> 00:09:00.529
Trevor, no!

104
00:09:00.529 --> 00:09:01.009
Okay, just...

105
00:09:05.549 --> 00:09:06.509
So someone help!

106
00:09:11.259 --> 00:09:12.059
Amelia?

107
00:09:12.059 --> 00:09:16.990
Oh, no, no.
