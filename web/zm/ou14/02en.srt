1
00:00:04,179 --> 00:00:15,220
Jesus Christ, Michael, I'm getting changed in here.

2
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:17,500
Be at this location in an hour.

3
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,500
The client doesn't appreciate tardiness.

4
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,500
No.

5
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,500
Mass dancers don't engage in those kind of transactions.

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,500
We signed a contract.

7
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,500
Don't forget, Betty.

8
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,500
There's a special clause in our contract.

9
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:31,500
If someone's willing to spend $100,000...

10
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,500
And I don't have the right to...

11
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,500
Refuse.

12
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,500
That's right.

13
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,500
This guy's willing to spend $100,000 and some girl he doesn't know.

14
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,500
Must be a cuckoo.

15
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,759
The Empire Hotel?

16
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:45,759
This is where my regular job is.

17
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:47,759
If they see me, they're like, this, I'm going to get fired.

18
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:48,759
I'm sorry, Betty.

19
00:00:48,759 --> 00:00:52,759
Believe me when I say that the client is someone you do not want to cross.

20
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:55,759
Think about your mom in her medical bills?

21
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:58,950
I mean, you don't want to disappoint her.

22
00:00:58,950 --> 00:00:59,950
Do you?
