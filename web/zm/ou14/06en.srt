1
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:05,969
Hey, Nike.

2
00:00:05,969 --> 00:00:07,490
What's crackin'?

3
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:08,330
You okay?

4
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:15,900
God, Anthony, you scared me.

5
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:21,449
We're closed.

6
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:24,809
Mr. Wade, I'm afraid this is not our business hour yet.

7
00:00:24,809 --> 00:00:26,570
A girl from last night, Michael, where is she?

8
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:28,699
She didn't show up last night?

9
00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:29,940
No, she did.

10
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:35,210
She did, but, uh, listen, Michael,

11
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:36,649
I don't have any time for your fucking games.

12
00:00:36,649 --> 00:00:37,649
You're gonna find her for me,

13
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:41,359
or you and your club here are gonna be, uh, in hell.

14
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm sorry if my girl didn't live up to your standards,

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,560
Marcus, how about I send you two more?

16
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,479
That's compensation.

17
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:49,320
You know what?

18
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,920
Like, I'm gonna make this a little bit fucking easier for you.

19
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,399
Why don't you just tell me everything you know about her?

20
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:54,719
And I mean everything.

21
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,380
That's all.

22
00:00:58,380 --> 00:00:59,219
Now.
