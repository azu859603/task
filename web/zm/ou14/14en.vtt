00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.290
Thank you.

2
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.570
It's me. Are you okay? You look pale.

3
00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.649
Betty, Marcus is enforcing you to be with him, is he?

4
00:00:16.649 --> 00:00:17.649
No.

5
00:00:17.649 --> 00:00:19.839
So you do love him?

6
00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:20.839
I don't know.

7
00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:23.839
Betty, please leave him. He's dangerous.

8
00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:25.839
I can take care of you. I can protect you.

9
00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:30.019
Betty.

10
00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:32.020
Can you give me some time?

11
00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.880
Yeah.

12
00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.609
Take as much time as you need.

13
00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:41.460
Do you remember the first time we met?

14
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.619
God, you were so happy and carefree and you're not with him because of the money, right?

15
00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:49.619
No. It's complicated.

16
00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:52.200
Everything is going to turn out fine.

17
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.200
I believe that. I mean, look. I just got promoted.

18
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.200
Even though it was kind of weird how that happened.

19
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.320
I mean, good things come to good people, right?

20
00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.319
Betty?
