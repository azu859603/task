1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Duddy?

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:06,000
Marcus, what are you doing here?

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Came here to take my darling home.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Who's this?

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Anthony, my co-worker.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
And friend.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Nice to meet you.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,030
I know who you are.

9
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:21,030
And I've to warn you, you stay away from her.

10
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:25,960
Wow, brave kid.

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,960
You know, the funny thing is right now, Anthony, as I could shoot you,

12
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:30,960
nothing will happen to me.

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,960
You'll just be fucking gone.

14
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,960
Marcus, please don't.

15
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:35,960
I'm begging you.

16
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,100
Okay, Betty.

17
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:42,490
I'm gonna give you one more chance and then to decide.

18
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:43,490
Me?

19
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:45,030
Or him?

20
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:54,170
This is ridiculous.
