1
00:00:01,419 --> 00:00:07,860
I knew it. That bitch.

2
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:11,060
The Gambino family is gonna showcase these beauties

3
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:13,560
at the Global Jewelry Convention next week.

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,859
Each piece is extremely valuable,

5
00:00:15,859 --> 00:00:17,960
and they believe we can protect them better

6
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,969
than a security company.

7
00:00:21,969 --> 00:00:24,269
You're right, Han. Where did you get that ring from?

8
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:25,969
Don't lie to me. I'll be able to tell.

9
00:00:25,969 --> 00:00:27,969
So, wonderful John's guys.

10
00:00:27,969 --> 00:00:30,170
We hired to escort a batch of jewels to the docks

11
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:32,570
and I swiped the jewel from the stash.

12
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:36,460
Take that ring off. Let me see it.

13
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:43,320
Who are you supposed to deliver that stash to?

14
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,719
I don't know. All right?

15
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:45,920
Trust me. I'm just a nobody.

16
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,719
I don't know anything.

17
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,520
All right. You feel free to tell Kelly

18
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,920
the truth about Betty's situation

19
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,619
and let her know that I'm gonna get even

20
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:53,820
with her sooner or later.

21
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,920
As far as the ring goes, keep it amongst yourselves.

22
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,119
I understood.

23
00:00:58,119 --> 00:01:12,329
Now, get out of my sight. Go!

24
00:01:12,329 --> 00:01:17,689
Don't you have something you want to say to me?

25
00:01:17,689 --> 00:01:25,579
Thank you. And I'm sorry.

26
00:01:25,579 --> 00:01:28,379
I need you to understand that from here on out,

27
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:31,700
your mind, and that my words are absolute.

28
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,000
Don't disobey me.

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,280
Match for you.

30
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,280
You've just seen me as a toy, don't you?
