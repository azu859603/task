00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.390
But he chose you and this is how you repay her, huh? This is how you protect her?

2
00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:13.509
God, if anything happens to her, I will piss on your grave.

3
00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:21.000
Where are you going?

4
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.420
Gonna go settle some business. Just keep an eye on Betty for me.

5
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:41.740
Who does he think he is?

6
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.240
Hey, Betty, you're awake.

7
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:51.340
Anthony, it's Marcus.

8
00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.259
Yeah, he had to step out for something. Forget about him for a second, okay?

9
00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.780
God, I'm such a fool. If I didn't let you leave with that idiot, you wouldn't have been hurt in the first place. I'm sorry.

10
00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:14.319
No, Anthony, Marcus saved me. I need to go find Marcus before he doesn't think stupid.

11
00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:16.640
You need to rest. Please.

12
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.239
Anthony, I'm fine. Seriously, I need to go. I need to find Marcus.

13
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:28.709
Betty, I really love you. Can you give me a chance, please?
