00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,339
Alright, so you're looking for Betty.

2
00:00:02,339 --> 00:00:06,040
Let me tell you something about her. You have no fucking clue who she is.

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,039
No fucking clue! Shut up!

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:10,410
Shut up, Marcus.

5
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,410
You want to move from me and you'll never see her again.

6
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:14,910
What are you going to do? Blow my fucking brains out, Anthony?

7
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:21,679
What's Betty going to think about that?

8
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:23,679
Where'd you get the gun? Your parents? Put it down.

9
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:25,239
Put it down!

10
00:00:25,239 --> 00:00:27,239
Betty, I was trying to protect you.

11
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:28,239
Put it down!

12
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:33,390
Anthony, you're not even 21. You can't even be in here.

13
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:34,390
Go home.

14
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:37,030
I didn't ask you to protect me.

15
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:42,039
I'm not going to be out of here.

16
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:43,039
Betty!
