00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.509
Dan, I know what the tools are.

2
00:00:02.509 --> 00:00:12.859
Marcus.

3
00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:16.300
Mr. Gambino.

4
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.379
Marcus.

5
00:00:18.379 --> 00:00:21.070
I think you should understand it.

6
00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.210
You're not welcome here anymore.

7
00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.539
I can say the same thing to you, John.

8
00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:27.980
So am Mr. Gambino.

9
00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.839
Since your son's here, why does he tell us?

10
00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:34.640
Where are the tools?

11
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.909
Fred, there's a misunderstanding.

12
00:00:36.909 --> 00:00:39.429
The Gambino family is and always will be an ally

13
00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:42.960
to the Wade family.

14
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.390
Is that so?

15
00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.140
Is that why you had your son James here, team up with John?

16
00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.409
It's a commit treason.

17
00:00:53.409 --> 00:01:04.159
Shut up!

18
00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:09.459
What are the missing jewels?

19
00:01:09.459 --> 00:01:10.659
Exactly.

20
00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:15.430
James gave it to Betty's friend as a present.

21
00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.700
And here's another piece.

22
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:27.010
You got it off a man that James hired.

23
00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:31.579
What else James told me, Mr. Gambino,

24
00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:34.859
is that you know where the rest of the jewels are.
