1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:07,259
It's a horrible misunderstanding.

2
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:09,380
You see, I'm a decent man.

3
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:12,449
And I would never, never have any hidden agendas

4
00:00:12,449 --> 00:00:17,559
to betray my friends and allies.

5
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:18,559
This is unacceptable.

6
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:20,559
All I can say is,

7
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:25,550
it's a shame to have someone like James in my family.

8
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:28,160
I'm sorry, Mr. Wade,

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,020
and I'll do my best to make sure that he learns his lesson.

10
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:36,490
How about this, Mr. Gambino?

11
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:40,570
We'll settle things down within the family.

12
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:43,399
With Uncle John.

13
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:46,490
As for the jewels,

14
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:52,630
the Wade family will take on this compensation for their losses.

15
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:55,880
They'll take an insurance buyout.

16
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,039
It's a win-win for everybody.

17
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:00,579
What do you say?

18
00:01:00,579 --> 00:01:12,079
Of course.
