1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,530
What do you mean the sperm got mixed up?

2
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:07,530
Ms. Salvador, I am so sorry.

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:12,330
I mixed up your sample with the one meant for our VIP clients.

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:14,330
Then whose sperm is it, then?

5
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:16,329
You received Mr. Damon Green sample.

6
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:19,329
He donated it for research purposes three years ago.

7
00:00:19,329 --> 00:00:21,329
Who?

8
00:00:21,329 --> 00:00:22,329
Damien Green.

9
00:00:22,329 --> 00:00:25,320
This is his donation record.

10
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:37,179
How could it be his?

11
00:00:37,179 --> 00:00:38,909
No, him?

12
00:00:38,909 --> 00:00:39,909
Yes, I do.

13
00:00:39,909 --> 00:00:44,289
Damien Green is my ex.

14
00:00:44,289 --> 00:00:49,179
Your ex? What are you going to do about the baby?

15
00:00:49,179 --> 00:00:51,179
This is all your deadbeat dad's fault.

16
00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:57,179
None of this would have happened if he had you run off with your engagement ring and pond it to pay his gambling debt.

17
00:00:57,179 --> 00:01:00,740
Are you okay?

18
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:04,239
I'm just thinking about the baby.

19
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,519
Maybe you should tell him.

20
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:11,799
You know, he needs to know and you might even get back together.

21
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:13,799
Absolutely not.

22
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:15,829
He hates me.

23
00:01:15,829 --> 00:01:18,829
You can never know that this baby is his.
