1
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:07,830
Oh my god, this storm came out of nowhere,

2
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:10,390
cause are we gonna die?

3
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:15,400
No, no, we're not gonna die.

4
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,260
We just spotted her in a flight grant.

5
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:18,859
We're off force by 30 degrees

6
00:00:18,859 --> 00:00:28,500
and our altitude's challenged at 25,000 feet.

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:01:05,829
Hold on.

8
00:01:05,829 --> 00:01:08,010
North America's best captain.

9
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:10,170
You handled that emergency like a pro.

10
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,409
Again.

11
00:01:11,409 --> 00:01:13,489
If you lose control like that again,

12
00:01:13,489 --> 00:01:16,510
you won't be an LS copilot anymore.

13
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:20,040
Wait, Damien.

14
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,920
L-I-X organized a three month training program

15
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,989
to improve performance and as a leading airline,

16
00:01:26,989 --> 00:01:29,530
LS is conducting the trainings.

17
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:32,129
But it's a small program.

18
00:01:32,129 --> 00:01:34,689
I mean, even small tasks need attention,

19
00:01:34,689 --> 00:01:37,090
but why specifically did you have to fly out

20
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:39,829
from Switzerland to superpowers?

21
00:01:39,829 --> 00:01:41,310
This training program has garnered a lot

22
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,019
of attention from other airlines.

23
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:45,299
It's crucial for our reputation as an airline

24
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:46,540
that I attend.

25
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,099
That's for all and the charge.

26
00:01:49,099 --> 00:01:52,140
Interesting.

27
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,689
Cause I thought it was all about her.

28
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:58,629
Her?

29
00:01:58,629 --> 00:02:01,269
Please, she's not worth the effort.

30
00:02:01,269 --> 00:02:04,790
Sure.

31
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:08,909
Drinks?

32
00:02:08,909 --> 00:02:11,389
Five years and you're still within my reach.

33
00:02:11,389 --> 00:02:12,789
I'll let you go to the stop.
