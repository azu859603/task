Lucky did you hear that Damien is coming to visit L.S.'s Los Angeles branch and he's not just a

2
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:23,210
captain anymore. He's the president of the entire airline. Damien? Yeah. I know. Can you believe it?

3
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:31,989
RK Airlines is sending you to participate in L.S.'s training program and you're not seeing anyone

4
00:00:31,989 --> 00:00:37,859
anymore? So, oh gosh, wouldn't it be so beautiful if you two ran into each other and you fell in

5
00:00:37,859 --> 00:00:47,520
love again? No. I can't be screwed over like that. Besides, it's a huge airport. There is a very

6
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:57,450
small chance that we'd run into each other. Damn. I'm late. I gotta go. Good luck. You're gonna be

7
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:16,040
the best flight attendant ever. Thanks, honey. That's what I aim for. Move. Shouldn't you apologize

8
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:29,290
for bumping into someone? Is that enough? Get lost. Don't fuck with me. No. Keep it. You might have money,

9
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:40,420
but you have no manners. Who are you being a smart ass? Are you sure you want to do? My baby!
