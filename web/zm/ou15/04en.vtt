00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.820
Damien, Damien, why didn't you tell me you just got in? I would have waited for you with

2
00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:10.820
a tarmac.

3
00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.460
I'm going to realize the CEO, Damien Green, he's selling himself.

4
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.460
What?

5
00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.460
He's really the owner of Ellis Airlines?

6
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.460
Who's with him?

7
00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:19.460
They seem close.

8
00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.460
Let's be his girlfriend.

9
00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.460
Your chance for me.

10
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.769
He already has a girlfriend.

11
00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:31.250
What I do, and where I go, is none of your business.

12
00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.820
Since you're here, why don't you show some of the newcomers around?

13
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.850
You.

14
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:47.810
Come with me.

15
00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.810
It's been a while.

16
00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:50.810
How have you been?

17
00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.659
How do you think?

18
00:00:54.659 --> 00:01:00.600
You've achieved your dreams of flying.

19
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.859
You've started the world's largest airline.

20
00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:08.079
Plus you have a beautiful girlfriend.

21
00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:11.590
So you must be doing well.

22
00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:18.719
How are you still smiling?

23
00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:21.719
Did you forget how you betrayed me five years ago?
