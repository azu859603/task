00:00:01,899 --> 00:00:05,900
Hey, asshole! The fuck do you think you're doing with my girlfriend?

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:09,160
Dang it! Dang it! Damn it! Get off of him!

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:13,160
What happened, Lucretia? How can you possibly explain this?

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,320
I can't, Damien. I love this man.

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,320
What about us? We've been together for three years! You've told me that you loved me!

6
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:27,320
Love to you? No, I used to you, you idiot. I'm leaving you, for someone richer.

7
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:34,700
No, I don't believe you. What does this man have that I don't have?

8
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:42,520
A hundred times better than you are. You're a dead man. Stop it!

9
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:56,159
I love you, Lucretia. I am going to make you a lifetime.

10
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:09,299
Lucky, the last time I saw you, I swore to ruin your life.

11
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:15,129
What happens today is just the start.

12
00:01:15,129 --> 00:01:35,920
Not your stand, Damien. I did it all for you.
