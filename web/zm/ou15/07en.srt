1
00:00:21,329 --> 00:00:33,009
All these years I have been only one suffering.

2
00:00:33,009 --> 00:00:37,039
Your lip has five years. All his dreams have come true.

3
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:45,219
He's a pilot, a CEO, and he has a gorgeous girlfriend.

4
00:00:45,219 --> 00:00:52,719
He's moved on. Lucky. Now I know why you rushed in here.

5
00:00:52,719 --> 00:01:02,979
What are you gonna do? I never expected Damien to hate me so much,

6
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:14,379
but still nothing changes. Can't know what this baby says.

7
00:01:14,379 --> 00:01:25,700
I'm gonna ask Mr. Keller if I can skip illustrating.

8
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:31,540
Is the ever composed captain Damien losing his cool?

9
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:37,230
Admit it. Still have feelings for her. Just go and get her back.

10
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:46,689
Maybe you didn't hear me. She's married and pregnant.

11
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:49,329
So what? Just get her back and raise the kid as your own.

12
00:01:49,329 --> 00:01:54,829
Prom sell. That's bullshit. Even if she wasn't married,

13
00:01:54,829 --> 00:02:00,269
I don't want her. She shallow, vain, and a gold digger.

14
00:02:00,269 --> 00:02:05,310
Sure. Sure. So what she used to. If you don't want her,

15
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:12,530
why are you so angry? It sounds like you need an open.

16
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:15,169
Isn't there a welcome party for the training tonight?

17
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:21,199
Use that to make your move. She'll be there.

18
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:26,800
Might have seen her name on the guest list. So you going?

19
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:33,599
You know I don't go to those things.
