1
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:22,879
I was just wondering if there was someone else who could take my place at the LS training.

2
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:25,879
Lucky, no need to be so formal. Sit down.

3
00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:26,879
Oh, that's okay.

4
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:28,879
No need to be so formal.

5
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:33,670
Which closest we were his childhood friends, right?

6
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:39,539
You know, it was pretty hard trying to stay in touch with you, transfer of schools, moving.

7
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:42,689
I remember good friends.

8
00:00:42,689 --> 00:00:51,210
Brad, I'm really happy I got a job at your company, too.

9
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:55,359
It's my world, right? Okay.

10
00:00:55,359 --> 00:01:02,899
In fact, why we're here. Can you explain to me why we'll do the LS training program?

11
00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:06,900
I mean, it's a great opportunity and anybody who does it, they can promote it. You can be head attendant.

12
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:11,900
I know, it is a great opportunity, but I'm just feeling a little bit under the weather.

13
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:19,390
Okay, understandable. Definitely the woman you have to exhaust in.

14
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:22,709
How about this? I want you to do something for me. I'm going to make a phone call tomorrow.

15
00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:25,930
I want you to attend. It's welcome.

16
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:40,420
And I did not expect you to come just for me.

17
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:41,420
You're overthinking this.

18
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:54,790
Why is he here? He always hated these months.

19
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:56,790
Is that grossed?
