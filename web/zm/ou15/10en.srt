1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:02,940
He's not your husband.

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:06,000
Of course not.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Pregnant. And sneaking around with your boss at parties.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
You are as shameless as ever at the looker.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,380
He noticed I'm pregnant.

6
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:18,469
But Tamey and C's clueless about the child.

7
00:00:18,469 --> 00:00:22,050
Looks like the doctor kept it a secret.

8
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:26,399
Mr. Green, I am not married.

9
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:30,390
So I can attend parties with you ever.

10
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,759
Not married.

11
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:37,140
Then whose child is that?

12
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,140
It's one of your business.

13
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,270
Oh, I see.

14
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:42,270
You've been with so many men.

15
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,270
You don't know who the father is.

16
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:47,270
Fuck you. You make me sick.

17
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:48,270
I make you sick.

18
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:53,270
Of the two of us, you are both a gold digger and a cheater.

19
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:56,270
Do you even remember what you did to me?

20
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:58,399
Why are you dredging up the past?

21
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:04,230
Because it might be in the past for you, but not for me.

22
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:09,060
I've had to live with every day since then.
