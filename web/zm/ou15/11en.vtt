00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.580
Don't look at me like that. I'm not the one who did something wrong.

2
00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:13.650
Fine. You came here for revenge. What do you want then? Just tell me what you want so you can go away.

3
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:28.730
What I want. What I want is for you to satisfy me.

4
00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:36.719
Excuse me? You don't want to. You're carrying someone else's baby. What's the big deal of asking them with me?

5
00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:44.380
You know that I'm pregnant and you want me to satisfy you.

6
00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.380
It's not enough to torture me. You have to torture my unborn baby too.

7
00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.380
Is it the baby that you care about? Or is it the father?

8
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.380
You don't know anything. You're insane.

9
00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:59.549
And I'm going to torment you until I feel you've had enough.

10
00:00:59.549 --> 00:01:02.549
And if your baby gets caught in the crossfire, so be it.

11
00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:05.549
Fuck you. You can hurt me all you want, but you can't harm my unborn child.

12
00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:13.340
Regret it. It's just a bastard. It doesn't deserve any.

13
00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.340
Stop calling him that. You don't know anything.

14
00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:22.340
You don't know who the father is. That makes it a bastard and you a whore.

15
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.340
Fuck you, Damien. I pray every night that this baby doesn't find out that you're it's...

16
00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:33.730
every night that this baby doesn't find out that you're it's...

17
00:01:33.730 --> 00:02:01.239
I'm fine. I'll be out in a second.

18
00:02:01.239 --> 00:02:05.709
Have you been? I saw you two sneak off earlier.

19
00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:08.939
You're going to refrain from washing that hand for the next month?

20
00:02:08.939 --> 00:02:14.300
You talked too much. I thought you loved it.

21
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.819
Tell me what I need to know about dealing with the prank.

22
00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.819
Oh. You two are taking it to the next level.

23
00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:29.939
No. I can't control my emotions when I'm around her. I think I scared her today.

24
00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:34.189
I don't actually want any harm to come to her or a baby.

25
00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:37.189
You act tough, but you care too much.

26
00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:43.539
You forgot to say it's a man. Control yourself. You're probably already blew it.

27
00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:52.650
I heard she's not even joining us for the LS training tomorrow.

28
00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.650
Thanks for staying over, Sonny.

29
00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.650
How could Damien do that to you?

30
00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.419
He hates me.

31
00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:01.419
I heard him. I betrayed him.

32
00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:03.830
And I have to suffer the consequences.

33
00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.370
Don't say that.

34
00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.819
I remember not too long ago you two were madly in love with each other.

35
00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:14.490
I know you had your reason.

36
00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:19.560
Or you're still in love with him?

37
00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.389
Why don't you just tell him the truth?

38
00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:24.389
He wouldn't believe me.

39
00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:27.389
Besides, he's a girlfriend now.

40
00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:31.680
I shouldn't disrupt his life just so he can stop hating me.

41
00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:39.770
At least you don't have to go to LS training anymore.

42
00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:44.889
Just try to avoid him at the airport as much as possible.

43
00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:54.060
I will.

44
00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.060
Lucky, come quick.

45
00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.060
Damien is in rat's office and it is not looking good.

46
00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.060
Damien? What is he doing here?

47
00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.060
He says he's here for you.

48
00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.060
From me.

49
00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:11.889
Yeah, you.

50
00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:14.889
Either I'm taking her or you're getting a violation penalty.

51
00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:16.889
Okay, I won't let you take Lucky.

52
00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:19.889
Our spectra wishes even if it costs me everything.

53
00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:21.889
Fine. Suit yourself then.

54
00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:23.889
Our lawyers will reach out.

55
00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:27.819
Now what penalty? What lawyer?

56
00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:28.819
What's going on?

57
00:04:28.819 --> 00:04:36.180
Now what penalty? What lawyer? What's going on?

58
00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.399
Don't worry about it Lucky. I've got it handled.

59
00:04:38.399 --> 00:04:41.399
Okay, your happiness is all that matters.

60
00:04:41.399 --> 00:04:43.399
Mr. Keller, drop the act.

61
00:04:43.399 --> 00:04:46.399
It's just the violation penalty. It's not the end of the world.

62
00:04:46.399 --> 00:04:47.399
It'll see you in court.

63
00:04:47.399 --> 00:04:50.430
If he won't tell me what's going on, then you tell me.

64
00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.459
It's simple.

65
00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:55.459
Your boss here is trying to replace someone for LS training.

66
00:04:55.459 --> 00:05:01.459
So LS Airlines will sue RK Airlines for $10 million for breach of contract.

67
00:05:01.459 --> 00:05:04.620
$10 million?

68
00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:11.509
Yes, your boss is willing to pay $10 million just to keep you happy.

69
00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:13.310
Touching it.

70
00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:17.759
Brad, when I asked you to replace me, you didn't tell me about the penalty.

71
00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:19.759
It's not a big deal.

72
00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:21.759
Yes, it is. $10 million is a huge deal.

73
00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:24.790
No, no. I had our legal team increase it.

74
00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:29.199
Originally, it was only $30,000.

75
00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:30.810
Why?

76
00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:33.810
Because I want to keep you close to torment you.

77
00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:44.490
Now, it's your choice.

78
00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:50.490
Either come with me or your boss pays $10 million for your stubbornness.

79
00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:58.029
I'll go with you.

80
00:05:58.029 --> 00:06:18.990
Lucky is tomorrow's training materials. Read it all by tonight.

81
00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:36.750
Dad and the man hasn't spoken to me since I went back to LS with him.

82
00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:52.959
What is he want from me?

83
00:06:52.959 --> 00:06:55.540
You have a girlfriend now.

84
00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:58.699
Why can't you just both let us move on?

85
00:06:58.699 --> 00:07:14.490
Those are my initials.

86
00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:15.490
Could it be?

87
00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:19.060
No, lucky.

88
00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:22.060
Be realistic. He hates you.

89
00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:24.060
He wouldn't need his company after you.

90
00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:42.680
Lucretia, I once told you I would make sure the whole world would know your name one day.

91
00:07:42.680 --> 00:08:07.980
Today marks your first official day of training.

92
00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:13.980
I figured no better way to start off than running through some hypotheticals.

93
00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:18.899
Let's say a passenger falls ill on your flight.

94
00:08:18.899 --> 00:08:22.500
How would you handle it?

95
00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:27.569
Cold sweat, rapid chest movement, heavy breathing. It's clearly a heart attack.

96
00:08:27.569 --> 00:08:33.570
The priority would be to lay him flat and perform CPR to stabilize the breathing.

97
00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:37.940
Well, let's see how you perform CPR.

98
00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:40.940
Oh my god, I'd rather die and do melt to my phillium.

99
00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:48.840
Yeah, that's a lot.

100
00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:53.730
Safin, are you doing this on purpose?

101
00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:56.980
Anything could happen on the flight.

102
00:08:56.980 --> 00:09:00.980
If you can handle this, I would suggest that you quit before we finish the training.

103
00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:09.750
If you can handle this, I would suggest that you quit before we finish the training.

104
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:15.019
No, you're right. I'll do it.

105
00:09:15.019 --> 00:09:47.590
Wait, you may continue.

106
00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:49.590
What are you doing? I'm trying to train them.

107
00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:51.659
Our analysis was spot on.

108
00:09:51.659 --> 00:09:54.750
Now, we need to test our CPR skills.

109
00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:58.620
I will supervise to ensure fairness.

110
00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:10.700
But again, Lucretia, delaying treatment only makes me doubt in professionalism.

111
00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:32.289
Did it too slow?

112
00:10:32.289 --> 00:10:34.740
Do it again, like I do.

113
00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:45.779
He's unbearable. This isn't CPR. He's kissing me on purpose.

114
00:10:45.779 --> 00:10:48.779
Why? Is this part of his revenge?

115
00:10:48.779 --> 00:10:59.809
Not bad. Again.

116
00:10:59.809 --> 00:11:04.769
God, I should have volunteered. I could be kissing the CEO right now.

117
00:11:04.769 --> 00:11:05.769
So jealous.

118
00:11:05.769 --> 00:11:24.769
Listen, Green, he's quite meticulous.

119
00:11:24.769 --> 00:11:27.769
That's probably why he made you do CPR so much. Don't take it to heart.

120
00:11:27.769 --> 00:11:32.019
Meticulous. It's clearly getting revenge.

121
00:11:32.019 --> 00:11:36.120
Mr. Green is quite the catch, but I'm sure you've heard the rumors.

122
00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:39.120
And he's more of a love than leave them kind of type.

123
00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:48.049
You wouldn't fall in love with him, would you?

124
00:11:48.049 --> 00:11:50.049
But I'm sure you've heard the rumors.

125
00:11:50.049 --> 00:11:53.179
And he's more of a love than leave them kind of type.

126
00:11:53.179 --> 00:11:56.210
You wouldn't fall in love with him, would you?

127
00:11:56.210 --> 00:12:00.690
Well, let's not talk about him. What brings you by?

128
00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:05.690
Oh, I, well, I just wanted to, you know, check in on the training.

129
00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:08.690
And, well, I brought you some avocados.

130
00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:11.809
I know that you've been eating them so much lately.

131
00:12:11.809 --> 00:12:15.990
Oh, I had that so thoughtful.

132
00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:18.990
Yeah, I remember you hated them as a kid.

133
00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:21.990
So, how did that change?

134
00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:28.990
Avocados are good for the baby's brain development, but my surrogacy isn't something I want to share with Rad.

135
00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:37.629
To oily, she prefers things that are lighter, sweeter.

136
00:12:37.629 --> 00:12:43.029
How would you know her preferences?

137
00:12:43.029 --> 00:12:48.779
She didn't tell you? I'm her ex.

138
00:12:48.779 --> 00:12:52.649
I thought you said exes and not together.

139
00:12:52.649 --> 00:12:54.649
Also, you're hurting her.

140
00:12:54.649 --> 00:12:58.179
Feeling protective.

141
00:12:58.179 --> 00:13:01.600
As far as I'm concerned, you're just her boss.

142
00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:03.600
You have no say in her personal affairs.

143
00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:04.730
Oh, yeah?

144
00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:08.730
Lucky and I have known each other since we were kids, okay?

145
00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:10.730
She trusts what I have to say.

146
00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:24.000
You never cease to surprise me. Come with me.

147
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
I said let her go.

148
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:40.029
Damien.

149
00:13:40.029 --> 00:13:42.769
Childhood friends?

150
00:13:42.769 --> 00:13:44.769
You sure know how to keep things interesting?

151
00:13:44.769 --> 00:13:46.769
That was in the past. We moved away. We lost touch.

152
00:13:46.769 --> 00:13:47.769
Enough.

153
00:13:47.769 --> 00:13:48.769
I don't want to hear him.

154
00:13:48.769 --> 00:13:52.009
What?

155
00:13:52.009 --> 00:13:55.460
You seemed pretty into it during training.

156
00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:57.460
That was an emergency response.

157
00:13:57.460 --> 00:14:07.750
Yeah, it smelled just like you used to.

158
00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:11.750
Damien, I never agreed to sleep with you. Remember?

159
00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:16.960
I've changed my mind. You don't have to agree anymore.

160
00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:20.470
What you want and don't want is a fairy.

161
00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:31.340
Because I know what I want.

162
00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:34.340
In your dreams, Damien Green.

163
00:14:34.340 --> 00:15:03.779
In your dreams, Damien Green.

164
00:15:03.779 --> 00:15:09.710
See? Can't resist me.

165
00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:14.289
I'm pregnant, Damien. My hormones are out of control, right?

166
00:15:14.289 --> 00:15:18.139
It's just lost. Nothing.

167
00:15:18.139 --> 00:15:23.169
Fine. Lost is lost, but one way or another, you'll end up in my bed, lucky.

168
00:15:23.169 --> 00:15:25.000
That'll never.

169
00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:31.700
Oh? Because of your excellent performance, a less training program.

170
00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:37.750
I'm promoting you, an assistant trainer. You report to me, daily.

171
00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:39.259
Daily?

172
00:15:39.259 --> 00:16:00.120
Yes. And every day.

173
00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:05.240
I cannot take it anymore. They kissed every one.

174
00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:09.240
Sandra, don't worry. Don't cry no matter what.

175
00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:11.240
Read your daughter-in-law, our family recognizes.

176
00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:13.980
It's the use.

177
00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:18.039
I've tried to get his attention for years.

178
00:16:18.039 --> 00:16:20.039
He still only has eyes for her.

179
00:16:20.039 --> 00:16:22.039
That doesn't matter. Remember?

180
00:16:22.039 --> 00:16:26.039
We already used Damien's donated sample to get you pregnant.

181
00:16:26.039 --> 00:16:42.830
I'm sorry. The sample was mixed up.

182
00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:48.110
I, uh... I can help you terminate the pregnancy quietly.

183
00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:54.649
Fucking serious. Who has Damien's sample then?

184
00:16:54.649 --> 00:16:56.649
I've already made mistakes from my mother's dialysis.

185
00:16:56.649 --> 00:17:00.779
I can't make another mistake and let anything happen to myself.

186
00:17:00.779 --> 00:17:04.779
I don't know. I only handled your injection and nothing else.

187
00:17:04.779 --> 00:17:12.539
Do you want to terminate the pregnancy?

188
00:17:12.539 --> 00:17:20.579
If I lose this baby, Damien will never marry me.

189
00:17:20.579 --> 00:17:25.119
You will tell everyone that this baby is Damien Grace.

190
00:17:25.119 --> 00:17:40.059
Correct? If we don't tell Damien about this baby soon, we will lose him to that woman.

191
00:17:40.059 --> 00:17:46.059
It's my fault. I plan to announce it next month at my birthday swari, but it seems like we can't wait.

192
00:17:46.059 --> 00:17:50.059
You old hag at the Insemination. Was it arranged by you?

193
00:17:50.059 --> 00:17:53.059
I had told Damien about the baby in long time ago.

194
00:17:53.059 --> 00:17:58.640
Don't worry. Once I announce the baby, he'll forget all about her.

195
00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:08.819
Didn't you already pay them back? Why are they asking for more money?

196
00:18:08.819 --> 00:18:10.819
They said they're still interest.

197
00:18:10.819 --> 00:18:14.650
Dad, how could you let this happen again?

198
00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:16.650
I know I haven't been a good father.

199
00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:22.150
I only have you. If you don't help me, they're gonna kill me.

200
00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:23.150
Then let them kill you.

201
00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:36.839
You think you can seduce my son again, you tramp?

202
00:18:36.839 --> 00:18:40.839
Mrs. Green, what are you doing here? I'm just working.

203
00:18:40.839 --> 00:18:44.839
Still denying it. I ought to beat the truth right out of you.

204
00:18:44.839 --> 00:18:48.839
Mrs. Green, you're Damien's mother, and I respect that.

205
00:18:48.839 --> 00:18:51.839
But if this happens again, I won't be so polite.

206
00:18:51.839 --> 00:18:54.839
Oh, oh. Growing a backbone, aren't we?

207
00:18:54.839 --> 00:18:57.000
Aren't you afraid of what my son will say?

208
00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.380
Bitch. Don't forget whose territory you're on.

209
00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:04.380
It's a little late to be acting brave.

210
00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:05.380
I've done nothing wrong.

211
00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:08.380
Security, get her out of my sight.

212
00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:11.180
What are you doing? We're moving the trash.

213
00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:15.180
From over from the premises immediately, I'll be responsible for any issues that arise.

214
00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:16.180
Let her go.

215
00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:34.349
Oh, Damien, you're just in time. This woman's disrespecting me.

216
00:19:34.349 --> 00:19:37.349
She has to go. Before you got here, she was hitting your mother.

217
00:19:37.349 --> 00:19:39.349
No, I wasn't.

218
00:19:39.349 --> 00:19:43.250
I heard everything. You two were practically terrorizing her.

219
00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:47.250
Damien, it's not true. She grabbed me so hard. Look how red my wrist is.

220
00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:50.250
She was so aggressive. Thank goodness security was nearby.

221
00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:53.500
Enough. Mother, stop lying.

222
00:19:53.500 --> 00:20:01.809
Damien, you need to decide. It's either her or me.

223
00:20:01.809 --> 00:20:12.380
I will not let her go. She is an assistant trainer at LS's training program.

224
00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:17.380
And if I catch you near her again, it'll be you who's escorted off.

225
00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:24.380
Damien, you're defending her in front of Zandra. Do you even care about your fiancé?

226
00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:29.980
Mother, how many times do I have to tell you that Zandra's not my fiancé?

227
00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:34.420
And I will never marry her.

228
00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:37.710
What? They're not in a relationship?

229
00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:49.410
But Zandra is having your baby. But Zandra is having your baby.

230
00:20:49.410 --> 00:20:59.329
What are you talking about? I've never touched her.

231
00:20:59.329 --> 00:21:08.220
And I have to. We use your donated sperm for artificial insemination. She's carrying your baby.

232
00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:15.769
That was for research purposes. How could you do this?

233
00:21:15.769 --> 00:21:22.390
Oh my god. The mix-up was with Zandra?

234
00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:45.099
Give up your future form.

235
00:21:45.099 --> 00:21:53.599
I need to tell Damien that Zandra isn't carrying his baby.

236
00:21:53.599 --> 00:22:05.009
If Lucky was carrying your baby, would she be hesitating to marry her too?

237
00:22:05.009 --> 00:22:20.279
Did that hit a nerve? I'm sorry. Have you forgotten how that slut hurt you?

238
00:22:20.279 --> 00:22:31.150
She doesn't deserve to carry my child.

239
00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:56.819
If Lucky were having my baby, it would be a disgrace. I would separate them and make their lives a living out.

240
00:22:56.819 --> 00:22:59.819
He sees you carrying his child as a disgrace?

241
00:22:59.819 --> 00:23:03.809
How can you see that?

242
00:23:03.809 --> 00:23:11.150
I don't know. He's changed so much. I can't let him know that this baby is his.

243
00:23:11.150 --> 00:23:18.369
Well, if Zandra isn't his girlfriend anymore, then are you going to tell him that the baby she's carrying isn't his?

244
00:23:18.369 --> 00:23:28.099
If I tell him, he'll find out that I'm carrying his child. Damien is a lot of things, but he's not an idiot.

245
00:23:28.099 --> 00:23:41.740
He'll find out whether or not Zandra is carrying his baby.

246
00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:58.599
Thank you, Doctor. You will be rewarded. This is the address of the woman I spoke to you about.

247
00:23:58.599 --> 00:24:34.910
You'll ruin her. And the 30 grand is yours. Once our reputation is ruined, that you'll come back to us.

248
00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:46.450
Who is this? Damien? It's after ours. I'm not your slave.

249
00:24:46.450 --> 00:25:09.259
You're my personal assistant, so assist me whenever I need you.

250
00:25:09.259 --> 00:25:17.829
Not even with the gun to my head, Damien. I don't care about you. He didn't even ask if I wanted to go.

251
00:25:17.829 --> 00:25:51.259
He's your assistant. Oh, I don't want you to come get me. I want you to go to hell.

252
00:25:51.259 --> 00:25:57.720
He didn't really come. Damien, you can't just... who are you?

253
00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:13.069
Not a few missiles. Not answering my calls. Not answering my texts. God, you really hate me that much.

254
00:26:13.069 --> 00:26:28.410
You're pretty well. Your pictures are going to get a lot of likes.

255
00:26:28.410 --> 00:26:35.410
Please, let me go. I can give you money. I don't want money. I want you. I want I'm done with you.

256
00:26:35.410 --> 00:26:42.700
I'm going to take some nice photos of you and put them on the internet. How is that? Sounds like a car.

257
00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:46.049
Help! Somebody help me!

258
00:26:46.049 --> 00:27:27.220
Get the fuck out of me. I already called the cops.

259
00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:35.099
I don't know, maybe a burglar. Called the cops. Why are you here alone? Where's your dad?

260
00:27:35.099 --> 00:27:46.579
He doesn't need to know about my dad's mess. He's retired. He lives in the country beside now.

261
00:27:46.579 --> 00:28:02.390
Thank you for saving me. Why are you here?

262
00:28:02.390 --> 00:28:05.890
Me, so...

263
00:28:05.890 --> 00:28:13.259
No. Why did you drive all the way up?

264
00:28:13.259 --> 00:28:23.380
They come and see you without a reason. Can't I come and see you without a reason?

265
00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:30.079
Damien, there is nothing going on between us that needs a private discussion.

266
00:28:30.079 --> 00:28:34.099
You may not have anything to say, but I do.

267
00:28:34.099 --> 00:28:39.000
Fine. And see what you need to say and leave.

268
00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:47.180
Listen, I didn't know about Sandra's pregnancy and I never wanted it. I will never marry her.

269
00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:55.089
Who's carrying your baby? Would you be hesitating to marry her too?

270
00:28:55.089 --> 00:29:04.109
If lucky we're having my baby, it would be a disgrace. I would separate them and make their lives a living home.

271
00:29:04.109 --> 00:29:07.740
That's none of my business.

272
00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:14.319
Of course it is. You're the only woman I've ever married. The only woman we'll ever have one.

273
00:29:14.319 --> 00:29:17.859
I didn't agree to either of those things.

274
00:29:17.859 --> 00:29:23.259
I know what you're thinking. I will take care of you and your baby.

275
00:29:23.259 --> 00:29:31.779
He sees his child as a disgrace, but will accept someone else's.

276
00:29:31.779 --> 00:29:34.849
He just wants to torture me, bastard.

277
00:29:34.849 --> 00:30:02.869
Get out. I want to see your face for another minute. What do you mean? Why did you have to get back at me like this?

278
00:30:02.869 --> 00:30:17.210
Well, woman, I have given her so much. What more could she want?

279
00:30:17.210 --> 00:30:21.240
Well, buddy, did you do something to upset her?

280
00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:26.240
No, I tried to make it obvious that I was trying to make things right. Couldn't she feel that?

281
00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:29.240
Why don't you just tell her you still love her?

282
00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:33.240
No way. She misunderstood me. She should be the one to apologize to me.

283
00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:37.549
Oh, you're afraid she's going to reject you.

284
00:30:37.549 --> 00:30:42.019
I am not afraid of anything.

285
00:30:42.019 --> 00:30:56.329
Okay. You want someone else to take her? I didn't think so.

286
00:30:56.329 --> 00:31:13.579
Lucky. I heard from Sonny Leslie. Were you again? Were you alright?

287
00:31:13.579 --> 00:31:17.579
Don't worry, Rad. I'm fine. The police are investigating.

288
00:31:17.579 --> 00:31:21.480
Oh, thank you for checking in.

289
00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:29.460
I'm so glad you're alright. Why don't I take you to dinner tonight to help you feel relaxed?

290
00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:31.460
Oh, Rad, that's so thoughtful.

291
00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:40.079
Excuse me, come with her. Mr. Green, the terminal's big enough. I just need you to walk through us.

292
00:31:40.079 --> 00:31:49.990
Sure is. I do what I want. Take talk. We've got a job to do Lucretia. Flight simulation's about to start.
