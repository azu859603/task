00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:10,990
Hey, you need to stay away from your little friend. He's dangerous.

2
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:12,990
Who? Rad?

3
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:18,019
I think that you're the one that's dangerous. Stay away from me.

4
00:00:18,019 --> 00:00:23,019
Lucky. I'm not joking. He's not as nice of a guy as you think he is.

5
00:00:23,019 --> 00:00:26,019
I've known him for 12 years. That's longer than I've known you.

6
00:00:26,019 --> 00:00:30,339
Yeah, but I know men better than you. You should see the way he looks at you.

7
00:00:30,339 --> 00:00:45,539
I can't believe CEO has got captive to the simulation.

8
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:52,229
Isn't he so charming? It looks lucky to have a thing going on.

9
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:54,840
Have you just left a camera?

10
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,990
What are you talking about? I see the way he looks at you.

11
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:00,990
I mean, it's lucky you're looking too right.

12
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:05,629
No, not at all. Okay, well, if you're not going to go for it, then I will.

13
00:01:05,629 --> 00:01:09,629
Let's say you're reassigned to another position. It's my chance.

14
00:01:09,629 --> 00:01:13,299
Hope you don't mind. Not at all. Good luck.

15
00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:15,299
Well, Chris, he's out of the door. Get in here.

16
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:19,319
You're the lucky one.
