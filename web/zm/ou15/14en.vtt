00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.049
Who's quite wealthy?

2
00:00:02.049 --> 00:00:04.549
Are they talking about the baby's real father?

3
00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:10.050
No, it doesn't matter to me. I just want my baby to be happy and healthy.

4
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.300
Good. Lucky doesn't care about that man.

5
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.300
No one's wealthy to be made.

6
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.300
If possible, it's best to find a second parent for the baby.

7
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:32.369
A complete family is beneficial to the child's growth.

8
00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.369
Thank you, doctor. I'll think about it.

9
00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:44.960
Damien, what are you doing here?

10
00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:52.600
Consider me. How about her?

11
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.600
Consider what?

12
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.600
What the doctor just said.

13
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.109
You heard everything?

14
00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:08.060
Damien, I can explain everything. Just please, don't hurt the baby. It's innocent.

15
00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.060
You don't have to explain anything. The doctor said the baby needs a father.

16
00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.060
I'm willing to complete your family. You're just married.

17
00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.599
What?

18
00:01:17.599 --> 00:01:19.659
You heard me.

19
00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:21.659
I'm married.
