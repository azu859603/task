00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.419
No, what I mean is you heard the doctor say the baby needs a father?

2
00:00:06.419 --> 00:00:12.560
Yes. Listen, lucky I think you should take his advice. I'm the perfect candidate.

3
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:19.780
Of course you are. Because you're the baby's real father.

4
00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.780
Let's start over.

5
00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.440
Dina, you really...

6
00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:34.560
I would separate them and make their lives a living hell.

7
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.289
I still love you, but I can't risk you pretty hard, baby.

8
00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:43.670
Enough, Damien. Did you forget how we broke up?

9
00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:50.340
You? Do you even have a heart?

10
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.859
No, I don't.

11
00:00:51.859 --> 00:01:11.379
No, please. Stay away from me.

12
00:01:11.379 --> 00:01:15.840
Baby, I've missed you so much.

13
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.480
I'm leaving again. I've missed you too.

14
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.609
Take me and you're a llama if we ever miss mommy's face.
