1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,419
How did you know someone broke into my house?

2
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:06,150
My father's a general.

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:09,150
I heard him talking to his friends on the horseback.

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:16,239
Look very closely.

5
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:19,940
I got pregnant a month ago.

6
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:22,940
The break-in happened a few weeks ago.

7
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:26,070
Stop making baseless accusations

8
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:30,070
before I start questioning whether you're carrying Damien's baby.

9
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:32,070
Unless you've proof, of course.

10
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:35,490
Of course, my baby is Damien's.

11
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:37,490
Miss Green herself can confirm it.

12
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:46,020
You're pregnant?

13
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:50,799
When did that happen?

14
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:52,799
I've been pregnant for a while, Rad.

15
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:55,630
Okay, then.

16
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:58,979
Who's the father?

17
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:03,380
I mean, again.

18
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,379
She has probably been with so many men.

19
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:07,379
We didn't even know who the father is.

20
00:01:07,379 --> 00:01:16,510
Mr. Keller, you seem to have some special interest in my Salvador.

21
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,510
Could you be the father?

22
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:19,510
So I'm dressed to stop.

23
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:23,239
Rad and I are just friends.

24
00:01:23,239 --> 00:01:25,849
Lucky.

25
00:01:25,849 --> 00:01:27,939
I don't care who the father is.

26
00:01:27,939 --> 00:01:29,939
I'm willing to be there for you and your baby.

27
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:31,939
Rad, you don't have this.

28
00:01:31,939 --> 00:01:32,939
Lucky?

29
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:36,030
Like you since we were kids, give me the chance.

30
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:42,450
I care of you and the baby.
