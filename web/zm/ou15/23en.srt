1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:05,929
Hey, Sonny, didn't.

2
00:00:05,929 --> 00:00:06,929
Right?

3
00:00:06,929 --> 00:00:07,929
We're back to arcade today.

4
00:00:07,929 --> 00:00:08,929
No, he hasn't.

5
00:00:08,929 --> 00:00:10,150
What happened?

6
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:11,439
Nothing.

7
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:13,439
It's fine.

8
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:15,789
Maybe I'm overthinking.

9
00:00:15,789 --> 00:00:18,789
Rad has always been cheerful and optimistic.

10
00:00:18,789 --> 00:00:21,789
He wouldn't do anything, Rad.

11
00:00:21,789 --> 00:00:36,079
What are you doing here?

12
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:37,079
How did you get in?

13
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:39,210
I used the key.

14
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:40,210
Remember?

15
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:42,619
I thought he was just saying.

16
00:00:42,619 --> 00:00:46,060
How do you have a key to my house?

17
00:00:47,829 --> 00:00:51,399
You gave it to me for my birthday, remember?

18
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:53,500
You... you kept it?

19
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,869
After all these years?

20
00:00:56,869 --> 00:01:00,380
I was going to ask you if you had something to eat.

21
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:06,349
Looks like I found my answer.

22
00:01:06,349 --> 00:01:13,219
Are you trying to seduce me?

23
00:01:13,219 --> 00:01:18,120
Remember?

24
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,150
Get over yourself, Damien.

25
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:22,730
We need to talk about the baby.

26
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:24,730
There's nothing to discuss.

27
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:28,239
I will raise the child as my own.

28
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:32,000
And you will stay by myself.
