1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:06,370
Okay? See, I'm here. Don't do anything stupid. Okay?

2
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:08,369
Do you care about me?

3
00:00:08,369 --> 00:00:12,910
Of course I care about you. Your best friends.

4
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:14,980
Best friends?

5
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:18,980
You're important to me. I don't want anything to happen to you.

6
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:25,820
They were what about Jamie? Is he important to you?

7
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:29,820
Jamie and I are over. There's nothing happening between us.

8
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,820
But you're carrying his child.

9
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,140
My baby.

10
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:39,140
The pregnancy happened before I ran into him again.

11
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:43,810
I became a surrogate to pay off my dad's debt.

12
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:46,030
Why did you say so well?

13
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:49,700
It's not something I'm proud of.

14
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:58,049
Plus, I didn't want you to think of me any differently.

15
00:00:58,049 --> 00:01:02,429
Look at the protection. You and your baby.

16
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:03,429
What?

17
00:01:03,429 --> 00:01:07,099
Well, that's friends, of course. Not pressure.

18
00:01:07,099 --> 00:01:10,099
Thank you so much, Rad.

19
00:01:10,099 --> 00:01:13,099
But you can't do things like this to scare me.
