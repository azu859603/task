1
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:16,899
Damien, can you remind me why you're not sleeping in your big, fancy house, and instead, why you're

2
00:00:16,899 --> 00:00:19,899
crowding my small bed.

3
00:00:19,899 --> 00:00:26,079
If you don't like it, sleep on the floor.

4
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:28,079
Hey, this is my house.

5
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:35,159
What's this?

6
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:38,450
Hey, don't touch my stuff.

7
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:44,810
Are we planning on proposing to love you?

8
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:45,810
No.

9
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:48,990
She chose someone else.

10
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:51,789
Brad, tell her.

11
00:00:51,789 --> 00:00:53,789
Yes, they've been friend since chart time.

12
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:59,740
She wouldn't say yes, even if I were to propose.

13
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:02,740
You caught her in bed with another man, yet you still love her.

14
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:06,739
Then you get sent a photo of her hugging someone else and you...

15
00:01:06,739 --> 00:01:08,810
What, you give up?

16
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:10,810
This is Damien I know.

17
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:11,969
Shut up.

18
00:01:11,969 --> 00:01:13,969
Or I'll beat your ass.

19
00:01:13,969 --> 00:01:16,450
Relax.

20
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:18,769
I'm kidding.

21
00:01:18,769 --> 00:01:19,769
It was just a hug.

22
00:01:19,769 --> 00:01:21,959
Didn't mean anything.

23
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:24,959
If she wanted to be with him, it would have happened longer.

24
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:34,769
Where are you going now?

25
00:01:34,769 --> 00:01:36,769
It's pouring outside.
