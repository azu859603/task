1
00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:07.320
I'll get done. I can't take their hands off each other.

2
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.939
Lucky you said he wasn't possible.

3
00:00:09.939 --> 00:00:14.560
Do you want to change that?

4
00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:19.219
We help each other. We both get what we want.

5
00:00:19.219 --> 00:00:21.399
Wow.

6
00:00:21.399 --> 00:00:48.490
What are you thinking about?

7
00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:52.149
What happened to five years ago?

8
00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:57.549
I never wanted to believe that you'd betray me.

9
00:00:57.549 --> 00:01:01.090
Was that all of misunderstanding?

10
00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:07.659
You've achieved your dreams now.

11
00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:09.920
And I know that you love me.

12
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.239
You would never do anything to hurt me.

13
00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:16.620
So I'm going to tell you the truth.

14
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:21.590
What's the truth?

15
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:37.329
Five years ago, your mother came to see me.

16
00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:39.329
And that's the whole story, Davian.

17
00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.680
I didn't want to hold you back.

18
00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:47.510
You had no right to make that decision for me.

19
00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.510
I never saw you or your family as a burden.

20
00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.469
I didn't want to destroy your future.

21
00:01:54.469 --> 00:02:04.180
I'm sorry I'm so angry.

22
00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.139
You've suffered enough.

23
00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:16.030
From now on, I need to protect you.

24
00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.030
I love you too, Davian.

25
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.199
Oh, and one more thing.

26
00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:26.030
About this baby.

27
00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:32.300
About this baby, Davian.

28
00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.710
He's...

29
00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:40.219
Lucky, come quick.

30
00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:43.219
Your dad was being up by the creditors who's drawing his breath.

31
00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:44.219
He wants to see you.

32
00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:45.280
What?

33
00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.500
No, no, I'm coming.

34
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.500
What's going on?

35
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.500
I...

36
00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:57.319
What if he's just using rad to lure me over for money again?

37
00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:00.319
I can't let him find out Davian and I are back together.

38
00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:02.319
He'll just ask Davian for more.

39
00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:08.069
If something came up at work, I gotta go in.

40
00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:11.000
What were you going to tell me?

41
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:31.580
You're after I come back.

42
00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:37.580
You're mine now.

43
00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:38.580
What are you talking about?

44
00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.580
Where is he? What is he up to?

45
00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.580
I cleared all of Peter's debts.

46
00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.900
He doesn't have to hide anymore.

47
00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.090
He's probably off enjoying himself somewhere.

48
00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.090
Brad, have you lost your mind?

49
00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.250
You didn't have to do that.

50
00:03:53.250 --> 00:04:00.180
I'm going to go find him so you can get your money back.

51
00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.180
Is there something else?

52
00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.860
You don't have to do anything.

53
00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:10.340
I'll do anything for you, lucky.

54
00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.099
Because I love you.

55
00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:16.800
Forget about Davian.

56
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:17.800
Stay with me, okay?

57
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:18.800
No, no, no.

58
00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.829
I only love Davian.

59
00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:22.959
Brad, we got back together.

60
00:04:22.959 --> 00:04:23.959
You did?

61
00:04:23.959 --> 00:04:30.019
I can't do this alone!

62
00:04:30.019 --> 00:04:35.980
No!

63
00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:43.149
I didn't mean to scare you.

64
00:04:43.149 --> 00:04:46.149
I got so annoyed hearing you mention his name.

65
00:04:46.149 --> 00:04:49.110
At least I'll be scared of you.

66
00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.100
Just calm down.

67
00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:53.100
I should...

68
00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.100
I'm gonna leave.

69
00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.259
Don't go.

70
00:04:56.259 --> 00:04:57.259
Don't leave me!

71
00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:09.949
You should take a look at this.

72
00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:12.949
You asked me to investigate the break in at Lucky's house?

73
00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:15.949
Well, I found that someone was sent by Zondra.

74
00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:16.949
She made a deal with him.

75
00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:18.949
That's why the police haven't found any leads.

76
00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:44.740
Zondra Smith, you're under arrest for criminal solicitation.

77
00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.740
You have the right to remain silent.

78
00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.740
Anything you say can, I will be used against you in a court of law.

79
00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.740
No, no! You have no proof.

80
00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.740
I bet you anything Lucretia is setting me up.

81
00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.740
If you work behind this, how do you know Lucky is picked up?

82
00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:57.740
Don't you talk about it.

83
00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.540
Dean Ian, are you wasting your time with this whore?

84
00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:03.740
I mean, come on, her father is already married or off to Rad.

85
00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:08.810
I'm the one being our child.

86
00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:19.670
I'm sorry, Mr. Green.

87
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:21.670
The child Ms. Smith is caring is not yours.

88
00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:26.670
She asked me to rewrite the hospital records to cover up the assimilation this happened.

89
00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:28.670
Insemination is half?

90
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:29.740
Yes.

91
00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:35.959
I was in charge of the artificial assimilation of Ms. Smith and Ms. Salvador,

92
00:06:35.959 --> 00:06:43.120
but I accidentally mixed up the samples and Ms. Salvador ended up receiving yours instead.

93
00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.120
Excuse me?

94
00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.889
Ms. Lucretia Salvador?

95
00:06:47.889 --> 00:06:55.360
She asked me not to tell you.

96
00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.360
Lucky is carrying my child.

97
00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:03.459
Why would she hide that for me?

98
00:07:03.459 --> 00:07:05.459
Sorry, but I don't know the answer to that.

99
00:07:05.459 --> 00:07:24.310
Why?

100
00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:34.819
Why is she answering her phone?

101
00:07:34.819 --> 00:07:36.819
Put me through to Lucretia's salary law, please.

102
00:07:36.819 --> 00:07:38.819
I'm sorry she's not here.

103
00:07:38.819 --> 00:07:40.300
What?

104
00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:42.500
Is her boss there?

105
00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:44.750
She asked her to come in early for an emergency.

106
00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:45.750
No, sir.

107
00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:51.459
Mr. Keller hasn't been there.

108
00:07:51.459 --> 00:07:55.350
What is going on?

109
00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:56.959
Inshrin Hall.

110
00:07:56.959 --> 00:08:04.230
Inshrin Hall.

111
00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:05.230
Damn it.

112
00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:06.230
Lucky, where are you?

113
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:08.259
I need to talk to you.

114
00:08:08.259 --> 00:08:12.819
Damien, when did you get back?

115
00:08:12.819 --> 00:08:15.259
Wait.

116
00:08:15.259 --> 00:08:18.259
Aren't you supposed to be in the countryside living the retired life?

117
00:08:18.259 --> 00:08:20.259
Why are you back in LA?

118
00:08:20.259 --> 00:08:22.300
I was running for my debts.

119
00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:27.699
The amount of that I got money, I don't need to run them.

120
00:08:27.699 --> 00:08:32.450
Where's Lucky?

121
00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:34.450
With my rich son-in-law, of course.

122
00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:35.799
Son-in-law?

123
00:08:35.799 --> 00:08:36.799
Who?

124
00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:43.090
Brad Keller is the owner of an airline company, and he's much more generous than you.

125
00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:50.860
He gave me $30,000 in advance, and promised me another $100,000 if I get my daughter to marry him.

126
00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:53.860
You son of a bitch.

127
00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:56.860
He'd probably kidnap Lucky.

128
00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:58.860
Tell me where they are.

129
00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:34.580
Roger Lynch?

130
00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:35.580
Where are we?

131
00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:36.580
What do you want?

132
00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:43.230
Take it easy.

133
00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:44.230
It's okay.

134
00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:47.190
I'll protect you.

135
00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:48.190
You know me.

136
00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:49.190
I'm not going to hurt you.

137
00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:51.190
I'm not a bad person.

138
00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:55.720
Well then, how do you explain this?

139
00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:58.549
I just don't want you running away again.

140
00:09:58.549 --> 00:10:00.549
You're my wife.

141
00:10:00.549 --> 00:10:01.549
Wife?

142
00:10:01.549 --> 00:10:03.549
We've been over this before, Rad.

143
00:10:03.549 --> 00:10:05.549
We are just friends.

144
00:10:05.549 --> 00:10:07.549
I will never marry you.

145
00:10:07.549 --> 00:10:08.549
Okay?

146
00:10:08.549 --> 00:10:10.940
You will marry me, Lucky.

147
00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:14.100
I couldn't take care of you from your chairs.

148
00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:15.100
I found you again.

149
00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:20.259
Don't worry.

150
00:10:20.259 --> 00:10:43.620
I'll give you time to take care of her.

151
00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:47.220
In your wildest dreams.

152
00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:53.669
You want the soft approach?

153
00:10:53.669 --> 00:10:55.789
We're going to do it rough.

154
00:10:55.789 --> 00:11:01.799
You know how long I've been waiting to fuck you?

155
00:11:01.799 --> 00:11:02.799
No.

156
00:11:02.799 --> 00:11:04.470
No breath.

157
00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:14.850
Stop!

158
00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:15.850
You do this.

159
00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:16.850
We'll never love you.

160
00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:21.950
You're fucking ex-boyfriend.

161
00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:22.950
No.

162
00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:28.139
Because even if he was in the picture, I would never loved you.

163
00:11:28.139 --> 00:11:31.169
I was a friend for 12 years.

164
00:11:31.169 --> 00:11:32.169
I know you loved me.

165
00:11:32.169 --> 00:11:36.029
Except that bastard took your love away from me.

166
00:11:36.029 --> 00:11:46.059
If I get rid of him.

167
00:11:46.059 --> 00:11:56.700
No, no, no.

168
00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:57.700
Please, Rad.

169
00:11:57.700 --> 00:11:58.700
Rad, don't.

170
00:11:58.700 --> 00:11:59.700
No.

171
00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:00.700
No, stay.

172
00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:02.049
Rad!

173
00:12:02.049 --> 00:12:16.419
Fuck you too.

174
00:12:16.419 --> 00:12:20.059
You know how much I want to be a grandmother.

175
00:12:20.059 --> 00:12:22.350
Well, don't worry.

176
00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:23.580
I will find her.

177
00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:26.580
And I will make sure that her and the baby are safe.

178
00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:31.710
Could he do this?

179
00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:33.379
Damn it!

180
00:12:33.379 --> 00:12:38.370
My gambling has ruined my daughter's life.

181
00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:42.899
Could the gambling bring my daughter back to me safely?

182
00:12:42.899 --> 00:12:43.899
Please!

183
00:12:43.899 --> 00:12:45.289
Stop!

184
00:12:45.289 --> 00:12:46.289
Stop!

185
00:12:46.289 --> 00:12:49.820
Cuz.

186
00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:57.269
Rad Keller did secretly take a helicopter, tracked him to this location.

187
00:12:57.269 --> 00:13:02.570
I'll go there quietly.

188
00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:03.570
My man.

189
00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:11.320
He is with me, Damien.

190
00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:14.320
If you want her back alive, come alone.

191
00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:15.799
Fine.

192
00:13:15.799 --> 00:13:17.799
Just don't hurt her.

193
00:13:17.799 --> 00:13:20.379
I sent you the location.

194
00:13:20.379 --> 00:13:21.409
Remember.

195
00:13:21.409 --> 00:13:23.570
Come alone.

196
00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:25.950
Or she dies.

197
00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:30.740
I have to go alone.

198
00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:31.740
Don't follow me.

199
00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:33.340
Damien!

200
00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:35.340
Oh, it's raining.

201
00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:44.059
I'm here!

202
00:13:44.059 --> 00:13:45.889
I need to trap you.

203
00:13:45.889 --> 00:13:46.889
You need to leave.

204
00:13:46.889 --> 00:13:47.889
You need to get out of here now to trap.

205
00:13:47.889 --> 00:13:48.889
Please!

206
00:13:48.889 --> 00:13:49.889
Don't forget about me.

207
00:13:49.889 --> 00:13:52.820
You need to leave.

208
00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:53.820
Too late.

209
00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:57.480
He's not going anywhere.

210
00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:58.480
I did as you asked.

211
00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:00.700
I came here alone.

212
00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:04.940
Now let her go.

213
00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:11.940
Damien, you are so nice.

214
00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:16.279
You should have known better.

215
00:14:16.279 --> 00:14:17.279
You had your turn with her.

216
00:14:17.279 --> 00:14:22.470
That was my turn.

217
00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:26.379
Sick.

218
00:14:26.379 --> 00:14:27.379
Fuck.

219
00:14:27.379 --> 00:14:28.379
I don't see any of them.

220
00:14:28.379 --> 00:14:33.019
I won't let this man hurt you, lucky.

221
00:14:33.019 --> 00:14:34.019
I'm fine.

222
00:14:34.019 --> 00:14:36.019
Please, get out of here.

223
00:14:36.019 --> 00:14:37.019
He's crazy enough to shoot.

224
00:14:37.019 --> 00:14:39.750
You made her cry!

225
00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:42.679
I'm going to send you to hell.

226
00:14:42.679 --> 00:14:45.159
No, Rad, don't.

227
00:14:45.159 --> 00:14:51.250
But I did.

228
00:14:51.250 --> 00:15:04.259
You want to protect him?

229
00:15:04.259 --> 00:15:06.279
Okay.

230
00:15:06.279 --> 00:15:08.279
I'll send you to hell too.

231
00:15:08.279 --> 00:15:41.100
I'm not a bad person.

232
00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:43.860
Lucky, I just wanted you to love me.

233
00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:46.759
Lucky, I just wanted you to love me.

234
00:15:46.759 --> 00:15:47.759
Damien.

235
00:15:47.759 --> 00:16:37.820
I'm so sorry I'm late.

236
00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:41.820
I graduated from LS training today.

237
00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:48.100
They named me the best flight attendant.

238
00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:56.909
Are you proud?

239
00:16:56.909 --> 00:16:57.909
My love.

240
00:16:57.909 --> 00:17:00.779
It's getting colder.

241
00:17:00.779 --> 00:17:01.779
Can you feel it?

242
00:17:01.779 --> 00:17:16.690
I remember when I was cold and you would hold me in your arms.

243
00:17:16.690 --> 00:17:19.039
I thought I wasn't cold at all.

244
00:17:19.039 --> 00:17:28.339
And now that you're gone.

245
00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:32.880
There's no one to hold me in our baby.

246
00:17:32.880 --> 00:18:02.460
I'll always be here to hold you in our baby.

247
00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:11.599
True week.

248
00:18:11.599 --> 00:18:34.140
I'm sorry for worrying about it.

249
00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:35.140
We're finally here.

250
00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:36.210
I know.

251
00:18:36.210 --> 00:18:40.059
He's so sorry too.

252
00:18:40.059 --> 00:18:56.400
My beautiful bride.

253
00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:59.650
I'm here to take you away.

254
00:18:59.650 --> 00:19:10.390
Honey, doesn't the airline own this plane?

255
00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:13.460
Isn't all this decor a little much?

256
00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:15.460
Babe, this is my private plane.

257
00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:17.460
I can decorate it how I want.

258
00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:31.619
We're going to Bali for our honeymoon.

259
00:19:31.619 --> 00:19:32.619
Cretia Green.

260
00:19:32.619 --> 00:19:36.130
You once told me that you loved the sky.

261
00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:38.380
You longed for your free.

262
00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:43.180
Now that you saw through the skies,

263
00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:45.180
you're a famous man.

264
00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:49.829
Of course it will.

265
00:19:49.829 --> 00:19:59.869
Me and Green, you belong to the sky.

266
00:19:59.869 --> 00:20:01.869
And I belong to you.
