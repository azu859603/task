1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,700
I can't believe the nerve to walk out on me.

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:06,700
Just cancel the room.

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,699
Chloe, I can't. It's past cancellation time.

4
00:00:09,699 --> 00:00:10,699
Just say it's a player player.

5
00:00:10,699 --> 00:00:12,699
I can't. They're cracking down on things.

6
00:00:12,699 --> 00:00:15,699
And with the hotel getting acquired, I can get fired.

7
00:00:15,699 --> 00:00:17,699
Eva, you know I can't wait for the room.

8
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:22,699
Maybe you should have thought of that before you booked a $5,000 night suite to loan some rich guy.

9
00:00:22,699 --> 00:00:23,699
He's stiffed me.

10
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:25,699
In more ways than one.

11
00:00:25,699 --> 00:00:27,820
Please, I'll pay him back.

12
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:28,820
I can't.

13
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,820
It's under my name. I can't pay for it.

14
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,820
Our management will fire me.

15
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,820
I need this job for my mom.

16
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,820
I don't have that kind of money.

17
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:37,820
What kind of money?

18
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:41,740
Chloe, what are you doing here?

19
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,740
I have to get back to work.

20
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:44,939
Chloe!

21
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:48,380
I can't wait for this place sells and they don't have to deal with idiots.

22
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:53,219
Eva, I see we have a guest in the Presidential Suite.

23
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,950
Good. I'll be keeping track of it.

24
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:00,469
Wow.

25
00:01:00,469 --> 00:01:05,790
Your best friend just cost you $5,000.

26
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:08,790
What am I supposed to do with a $5,000 night suite?

27
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:12,790
I mean, if you have to pay for it, you might as well enjoy it.

28
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:38,420
I guess I'm just drinking my way into debt at this point.
