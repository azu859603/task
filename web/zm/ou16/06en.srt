1
00:00:14,289 --> 00:00:15,470
Speak of the devil.

2
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:20,079
Your highness, um, can I call you your highness, um, Duke?

3
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:22,519
Can I, can I, can I please take a selfie with you?

4
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:24,289
Of course.

5
00:00:24,289 --> 00:00:32,909
She's fired.

6
00:00:32,909 --> 00:00:33,909
Security.

7
00:00:33,909 --> 00:00:34,909
No, please, please.

8
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:35,909
Like, I worked really hard.

9
00:00:35,909 --> 00:00:36,909
Please don't.

10
00:00:36,909 --> 00:00:37,909
I love you.

11
00:00:37,909 --> 00:00:38,909
He fired someone over a selfie.

12
00:00:38,909 --> 00:00:41,909
He definitely can't find out we slept together.

13
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:44,630
Your grace is an honor to have you here.

14
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:45,630
I am Christine Bernard.

15
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:46,630
Yes, I know.

16
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:47,630
You are?

17
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:48,630
Your reputation precedes you.

18
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:53,460
You've been the GM for the last five years and helped in the acquisition of this hotel.

19
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:54,460
Well done.

20
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:59,549
Since you're new here, I would like to offer you my secretary caped to assist you.

21
00:00:59,549 --> 00:01:03,560
Mr. Sinclair, great to be working with you.

22
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:08,980
Yes, I will need a new secretary, but I prefer to choose my own.

23
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:11,180
By the way, I am calling off the acquisition.

24
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:13,140
We're no longer silent.

25
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,739
You can't call it off.

26
00:01:14,739 --> 00:01:16,819
I've already signed a deal memo with Mr. Arrington.
