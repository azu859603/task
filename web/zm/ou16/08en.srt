1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
I want her.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Excuse me?

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
You ought to be my new secretary.

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Did you accept?

5
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
No.

6
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
No.

7
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
No, sir.

8
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I am just not capable.

9
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Are you the grant?

10
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Why her?

11
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
She's just a stupid death girl.

12
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,309
Why her?

13
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:21,309
She's the only one who didn't throw herself that Mr. Sinclair.

14
00:00:21,309 --> 00:00:31,460
Thank you so much for the offer, but I can't accept the job.

15
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:32,460
Whatever.

16
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,530
Someone else would be glad to take it at $20,000 per month.

17
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:41,920
Well, $20,000?

18
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,210
That's more than I make in six months.

19
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:46,210
Yes, for sure.

20
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:57,179
I'd be honored to be Mr. Sinclair's secretary.

21
00:00:57,179 --> 00:01:01,179
How the hell am I supposed to hide who I am from my boss when he's my actual boss?

22
00:01:01,179 --> 00:01:06,379
Did you find her?

23
00:01:06,379 --> 00:01:10,629
Miss Archer was just fired for having an affair with the guest.

24
00:01:10,629 --> 00:01:14,629
Apparently it took place on the premises and it followed booking the suite to hotel.

25
00:01:14,629 --> 00:01:15,629
Or guest?

26
00:01:15,629 --> 00:01:16,629
I think it's user.

27
00:01:16,629 --> 00:01:20,629
The room you accidentally walked into last night was booked in her name.

28
00:01:20,629 --> 00:01:23,719
She was fired because of me.
