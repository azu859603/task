00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:03.520
Do you, Christine?

2
00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.099
There's nothing wrong with sleeping with a rich guy.

3
00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:09.099
It's not my fault you can't get laid.

4
00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:14.429
Eva, did you lock herself out again?

5
00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:22.859
Oh, my God. What am I going to do?

6
00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:35.939
Can I help you?

7
00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:37.939
Oh, my God. We're as a bloodshot.

8
00:00:37.939 --> 00:00:38.939
She's been crying.

9
00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:41.939
Chloe! Mm-hmm. Miss Archer.

10
00:00:41.939 --> 00:00:44.939
I'm Edmond Sinclair. We met last night.

11
00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:45.939
Now it's not a good time.

12
00:00:45.939 --> 00:00:49.320
I just wanted to apologize for you losing your job.

13
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.320
I appreciate the apology, but...

14
00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.829
I don't really know what else we have to talk about.

15
00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:58.719
Please. Let me make it up to you.
