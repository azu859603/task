1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:03,710
Are you going on a trip?

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:05,110
What's he talking about?

3
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:07,870
Oh, he thought I was leaving.

4
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:19,550
Well, without a job, I can no longer pay the rent on my own, and I can't move home because

5
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:23,910
my parents are dead, so I have to find a cheaper place by tomorrow.

6
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:28,750
Listen, I appreciate you coming, but last night was a mistake.

7
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:34,799
Let's just pretend it never happened, besides it's not like someone can magically give

8
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:37,210
me my job back.

9
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:38,570
Actually, I can.

10
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:40,570
It's my hotel.

11
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:41,570
Your hotel?

12
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:45,170
Interesting Claire is the owner and new CEO.

13
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:48,200
Oh my gosh, that's so embarrassing.

14
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,200
I have no idea.

15
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,359
I'd be happy to have you real high.

16
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:52,359
I can't work with Ava.

17
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:53,600
She'll blow my cover.

18
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,439
Thank you, but I think I could stand the gossip going back.

19
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:01,399
I'd rather be homeless with my dick, maybe.

20
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:06,030
I just need to get back on my feet.

21
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:11,180
Well, would you like to live with me, just until you get in your job?

22
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,659
That ain't good.

23
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:13,659
Oscar worthy.

24
00:01:13,659 --> 00:01:15,150
You need to get that.
