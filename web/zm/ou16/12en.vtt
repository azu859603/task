00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.349
What's a car like that doing in our neighborhood?

2
00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:16.699
You became our CEO's secretary?

3
00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:19.699
Yeah, $20,000 per month.

4
00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:21.699
That's enough to cover my mom with medical bills.

5
00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:23.699
Just be careful.

6
00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.699
We're under disposable to rich guys like that.

7
00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.699
Who knows what he really wants?

8
00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:32.429
It's a little hypocritical, don't you think?

9
00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:35.429
How many times have I warned you about all the rich dudes you day

10
00:00:35.429 --> 00:00:37.429
and now you're giving me advice?

11
00:00:37.429 --> 00:00:40.429
I mean, I know he's a joke or whatever, but I'm just trying to protect you.

12
00:00:40.429 --> 00:00:44.429
I'm trying to protect me from the guy that was your target this morning.

13
00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:45.429
I was joking.

14
00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:47.429
I'm not interested in him anymore.

15
00:00:47.429 --> 00:00:49.429
I don't need some guy to pay my bills.

16
00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:51.560
Besides, I have good news too.

17
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.560
I got a job.

18
00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.560
And I'm moving out.

19
00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:56.979
Really?

20
00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:57.979
What job?

21
00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:58.979
You weren't even looking.

22
00:00:58.979 --> 00:00:59.979
You just got fired.

23
00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:01.979
Wait, and why do you need to move out?

24
00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:03.979
Why are you questioning me?

25
00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:04.980
Why can't you just be happy for me?

26
00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.980
Yesterday you spent like three months salary on a room to bone some rich guy.

27
00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.980
Now there's a town car outside and suddenly you have a new job and you're moving out.

28
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.980
I think it's fair for me to be concerned.

29
00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.980
What the hell are you insinuating?

30
00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.200
Do you think I'm just another shameless gold digger like everybody else?

31
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.200
You don't give a shit about me?

32
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.200
I'm not a whore.

33
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.200
I know.

34
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.200
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Look, that's not what I meant.

35
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.200
Let's just talk about it.

36
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.200
I'm done.

37
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.099
Is that your new job?
