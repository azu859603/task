00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,459
I'm sorry, Ms. Grown, so I'm not familiar with the American term jack-off, if you could explain it to me.

2
00:00:05,459 --> 00:00:08,839
Um, never mind.

3
00:00:08,839 --> 00:00:12,320
Good morning, Mr. Sinclair.

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,490
I just got word from her that she's decided to move in.

5
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:19,109
What should I introduce her to all the staff has?

6
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:21,579
Friend?

7
00:00:21,579 --> 00:00:25,079
He called the girl who's gonna move into his house a friend?

8
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:27,480
What a jerk.

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,980
Richmond really are something.

10
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:32,869
He slept with me and he had a girlfriend.

11
00:00:32,869 --> 00:00:36,689
Mr. Sinclair needs you to help his friend move.

12
00:00:36,689 --> 00:00:38,759
Asshole, of course.

13
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:43,890
Perfect chance to see what kind of woman this future duchess is.

14
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:50,009
I'll confirm with her and send you her address.

15
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:52,170
Ms. Archer, Mr. Sinclair is secretary.

16
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:53,929
We'll come to help you move.

17
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:55,369
What time is convenient for you?

18
00:00:55,369 --> 00:00:56,649
His secretary?

19
00:00:56,649 --> 00:00:58,210
He means Ava.

20
00:00:58,210 --> 00:00:59,009
No need.

21
00:00:59,009 --> 00:01:01,170
I don't have much, so I can do it.

22
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:04,849
Thanks, then I'll see you soon.

23
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:08,090
Oh my god, this is the last time I've ever done this myself.
