00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:10.019
Welcome, Ms. Chloe.

2
00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.019
Oh, my God!

3
00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:22.510
Hey, you guys!

4
00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:31.679
Sorry, I'm walking right by you.

5
00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:32.679
We're this.

6
00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:33.679
Fabulous.

7
00:00:33.679 --> 00:00:34.679
We have a life.

8
00:00:34.679 --> 00:00:36.679
Hashtag.

9
00:00:36.679 --> 00:00:39.579
Yellow.

10
00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:42.310
Heart eyes and lady.

11
00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:43.310
Here we are.

12
00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:50.369
Your bedroom.

13
00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:52.619
This is Edmund's bedroom?

14
00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:54.359
No.

15
00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:56.359
I'm supposed to be living with Edmund.

16
00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:57.359
Oh, I'm sorry, Ms.

17
00:00:57.359 --> 00:00:59.359
The Duke asked that you stay in this wing.

18
00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:01.359
His quarters are off limits to you.

19
00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:02.390
Well, that's nonsense.

20
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:08.099
What are you still doing here?

21
00:01:08.099 --> 00:01:12.420
Actually, draw me a bath and insta-cart me a green juice.

22
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:23.900
I don't know how you do business over there, but here,

23
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.900
once the deal memo is signed, there's no turning back.

24
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.900
You either move forward to the final agreement within one week

25
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.900
or pay the penalty, which is $20 million.

26
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.129
Those are the options.

27
00:01:38.129 --> 00:01:39.510
Oh, my God!

28
00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:40.670
I'm suing you.

29
00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.670
You can't even deliver coffee. Get out.

30
00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:44.670
Get out!
