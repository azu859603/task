1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,219
Oh, I'm sorry.

2
00:00:01,219 --> 00:00:03,680
This, his shirt is worth more than you.

3
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,259
Stupid idiots.

4
00:00:05,259 --> 00:00:07,059
My apologies, are you burned?

5
00:00:07,059 --> 00:00:08,500
We need to call it empty.

6
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:09,460
I'm fine.

7
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:11,099
It's not her fault.

8
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:14,939
Kristin, speak to my secretary that way again, before that.

9
00:00:14,939 --> 00:00:16,940
She answers to me, not you.

10
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:19,350
You're clear.

11
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:23,199
I'm really sorry, sir.

12
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,079
Sorry about your coffee.

13
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:28,239
I'm Clifford Harrington, and you are?

14
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:33,020
Eva Grant, I apologize again about your shirt, please.

15
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:35,939
Let me get it dry cleaned.

16
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:38,219
Is there something wrong, Mr. Harrington?

17
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:42,299
No, you just remind me of someone.

18
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:43,780
Eva Grant, is it?

19
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:48,140
Yes, Mr. Harrington.

20
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:52,060
I don't mean to speak out of turn,

21
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:56,100
but when I was listening to the meeting something dawned on me.

22
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,299
Go ahead?

23
00:00:57,299 --> 00:01:00,700
Even though JPG chains may not acquire M Hotel,

24
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,740
we could still be close partners.

25
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,900
There may be something to salvage here.

26
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:09,019
What the hell do you know about corporate partnerships?

27
00:01:09,019 --> 00:01:10,099
I apologize.

28
00:01:10,099 --> 00:01:12,540
She is not qualified to even be in here.

29
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,540
She should be a janitor.

30
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:15,939
Watch it, Kristin.

31
00:01:15,939 --> 00:01:19,260
And we're willing to come back to the table,

32
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:23,269
but only to hear Ms. Grant's proposal.
