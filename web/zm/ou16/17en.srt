1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:10,210
Fuck, no, no, Mr. Harrington. There is nothing to discuss. We have signed a deal memo. It is too late to back out of the acquisition.

2
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:12,210
Things change.

3
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:18,800
You'll need to tell me you're willing to walk away from the hotel acquisition.

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,500
If I see a collaboration plan, I can't refuse. Yes.

5
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:28,500
In that case, we'll do our very best to provide you with a plan that satisfies you.

6
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,429
But we, is grand.

7
00:00:31,429 --> 00:00:33,429
Of course, Mr. Harrington.

8
00:00:33,429 --> 00:00:40,579
Amazing job, David.

9
00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:43,579
Why did Clifford change his mind because of my secretary?

10
00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:48,500
We'll see you soon.

11
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,880
You little bitch.

12
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,100
You just killed promotion.

13
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,100
I swear.

14
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,100
I'm gonna make your life a living hell.

15
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,100
You will be scrubbing toilets when I'm done with you.

16
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:25,030
Mr. Green, one of our shareholders, is during a party at 8 p.m. tonight.

17
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:27,349
It was unclear whether you'd go with him.

18
00:01:27,349 --> 00:01:28,349
As his driver?

19
00:01:28,349 --> 00:01:29,349
His guest.

20
00:01:29,349 --> 00:01:31,349
His guest?
