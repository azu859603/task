1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,240
Mr. Green, allow me to introduce Ms. Ava Gromt.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,240
Edmond, nice to meet you.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,880
I didn't know you were bringing your girlfriend.

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,880
No, no, I'm not his.

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,880
Ms. Gromt is my secretary.

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,880
Oh, lucky for me.

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,879
Well, I know this is a work event, so I can still have a good time.

8
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:20,879
Oh, trust me, you don't want to see me drink.

9
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:22,879
Oh, no, I do.

10
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:29,539
Since we're going to be working together, I think we should get a chance to know each other.

11
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:31,539
Now, if you can now drink me, Ms. Grant,

12
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:34,539
I'll agree to work exclusively with Emo Tails.

13
00:00:34,539 --> 00:00:52,939
If that best stands, then I'll do all the drinking tonight for Ms. Grant.

14
00:00:52,939 --> 00:00:58,939
Now, if you'll excuse me, Ms. Grant, we would like to discuss the Oasis Project in Vegas.

15
00:00:58,939 --> 00:01:08,590
Mr. Sinclair, are you okay?

16
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:11,590
Look, I know you were trying to protect me and the Brits can drink,

17
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:14,590
but if you can't handle your liquor, you should really stop.

18
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:16,590
You were at least functional last time.

19
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:19,680
You lost time.
