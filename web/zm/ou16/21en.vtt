00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.560
Chloe, are you home?

2
00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:08.439
My God, she moved out?

3
00:00:08.439 --> 00:00:11.849
Smell right?

4
00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.669
What's that supposed to mean?

5
00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:21.670
This is a designer perfume that's only like 500 bottles in the world.

6
00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:22.670
What the?

7
00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:24.670
Chloe, where are you?

8
00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:25.670
I told you I moved it.

9
00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:27.670
I didn't think you were serious.

10
00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:28.670
You...

11
00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:30.670
Actually, I have a question for you.

12
00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:36.670
I'm looking for a new perfume and I always really like yours.

13
00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.670
Uh, what do you want?

14
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:39.670
Where'd you get it?

15
00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:40.829
Um...

16
00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.829
I think it's like some generic brand.

17
00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:44.829
I think I got it out in Nordstrom Rack.

18
00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:46.829
Well, could you send me a picture?

19
00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.829
I'm sorry we fought.

20
00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:52.829
I really miss you, but wearing your perfume makes me think of you.

21
00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.829
Hey, little Eva Smell.
