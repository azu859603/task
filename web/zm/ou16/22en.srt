1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:01,620
I miss you too.

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:04,660
Okay, perfect. Well, I gotta go. I'm really tired. Bye.

3
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:07,410
Hello? Chloe?

4
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:10,750
What is going on with her?

5
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:16,589
Well, either you're too easy.

6
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:19,070
Nordstrom rep, this is trash.

7
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:20,190
Why does it make me like it?

8
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:21,870
Good night, Madam.

9
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:24,079
Oh, you.

10
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:27,199
I need this perfume on my bedside table when I wake up.

11
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,800
But stores are closed.

12
00:00:29,949 --> 00:00:30,989
That's a you problem.

13
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:42,159
Good morning, Mrs. Gray.

14
00:00:43,179 --> 00:00:43,579
James?

15
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:45,420
Are you all right?

16
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:49,789
Ah, I was bitten by my dog last night.

17
00:00:49,789 --> 00:00:51,630
Just rough housing.

18
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:53,310
I didn't know you had a dog, sir.

19
00:00:54,689 --> 00:00:56,369
I guess I'm the dog.

20
00:00:56,369 --> 00:00:57,490
Wolf, asshole.

21
00:00:58,130 --> 00:00:59,810
You know what they say, Mr. Sinclair?

22
00:01:00,689 --> 00:01:03,009
Dogs don't bite people unless they're provoked.
