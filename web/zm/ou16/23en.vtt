00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.390
What are you talking about?

2
00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:22.359
Hey, you. Go fetch me my package from the mail room.

3
00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:24.190
You deaf?

4
00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:25.190
You hoo!

5
00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.190
Receptionist, I'm talking to you.

6
00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:30.190
Boss, you know she's clumsy and useless.

7
00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:32.189
Are you sure you even want her to grab your package?

8
00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.189
Probably has a disease.

9
00:00:34.189 --> 00:00:36.420
Mr. Nard.

10
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.509
First of all, I'm no longer the receptionist.

11
00:00:39.509 --> 00:00:43.509
Secondly, I don't take orders from you anymore.

12
00:00:43.509 --> 00:00:45.509
You have your own secretary.

13
00:00:45.509 --> 00:00:47.509
So I suggest you ask her.

14
00:00:47.509 --> 00:00:49.509
Bravo.

15
00:00:49.509 --> 00:00:52.640
You've been the CEO secretary for three days.

16
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.640
You think you can talk to me like that?

17
00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:55.640
Get out of my way.

18
00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.640
I heard about your mom.

19
00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.640
If you get fired, they're gonna have to unplug all those machines.

20
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:01.640
She'll die.

21
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.640
It must be shitty having a daughter like you.

22
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.640
One more word about my mom and I swear to God I'll slap you.

23
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:08.640
I dare you.

24
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.640
Doing great for little bitch.

25
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.640
Christine will have to fire you.

26
00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:13.640
She'll have no choice.

27
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:14.640
Let's test it.

28
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:22.579
She hit me.

29
00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:24.870
Fire her.

30
00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:26.870
Unfortunately, I can't.

31
00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.019
But let's be realistic.

32
00:01:30.019 --> 00:01:33.019
That fuck of a man is on vacation.

33
00:01:33.019 --> 00:01:36.019
And when he goes back to England, you are fired.

34
00:01:36.019 --> 00:01:38.599
Then mommy gets unplugged.

35
00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:42.019
How am I gonna get fired if you get fired first?

36
00:01:42.019 --> 00:01:46.500
What would Mr. Sinclair do if he found out you negotiated

37
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.500
a VP job with JPG Chains while you still collect money from his company?
