00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,040
Mr. St. Clair.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,299
Thank you.

3
00:00:05,299 --> 00:00:07,299
Mr. St. Clair, for your help.

4
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:12,880
I'm interrupting something.

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:22,050
Does she have to knock?

6
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:28,120
So who's this rich guy Chloe's marrying?

7
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:32,079
Marrying? She said she found a new job and moved out.

8
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,079
Wait, you didn't know?

9
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,079
Oh my God, you have to look at this.

10
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:42,450
Why does this house look familiar?

11
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,450
I'm sure all of rich people's houses look similar.

12
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:47,450
Look under her feet. It's like all over.

13
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:56,780
She blocked me.
