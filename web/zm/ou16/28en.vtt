00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.340
Chloe?

2
00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:04.500
I brought gifts for everyone.

3
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.500
I hope you like them.

4
00:00:10.439 --> 00:00:13.439
Is this a limited edition or may I scar?

5
00:00:13.439 --> 00:00:15.439
I can't believe it.

6
00:00:15.439 --> 00:00:17.440
Chloe, what happened to you?

7
00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.440
You look beautiful, stunning!

8
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.440
An elegant...wow.

9
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.019
Tell us what's going on.

10
00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.370
I just...got a new job.

11
00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:30.370
I love your instal.

12
00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:33.369
Are you actually living in a mansion with maids?

13
00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:38.009
I have to ask.

14
00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:41.140
Are you with a billionaire?

15
00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.679
Well, I like to keep my private life private.

16
00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:47.899
He's actually a trillionaire.

17
00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:50.100
Oh my God!

18
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.320
I've always knew not of something special.

19
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.340
Where the hell are you taking it?

20
00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.939
Who are you doing?

21
00:00:59.939 --> 00:01:01.939
You're with a billionaire?

22
00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:03.939
A trillionaire, actually.

23
00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:05.980
And he's everything I deserve.

24
00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.040
Why did you lie to me?

25
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.140
I've been wanting you to feel bad because he's everything you ever wanted.

26
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.140
You know I don't care about the money.

27
00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.140
I paid our entire rent for years.

28
00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.140
Are you really asking me for money right now?

29
00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.140
Just give me a number, I'll pay whatever to get you to shut up.

30
00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.140
That's not what I'm saying.

31
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.299
You're just jealous.

32
00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:28.359
Look, let's be realistic.

33
00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:30.359
We're different types of people.

34
00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:31.359
I'm rich.

35
00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:32.359
You're poor.

36
00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:34.359
You don't really have anything common.

37
00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:38.359
So you're sleeping with some rich guy and suddenly underneath you?

38
00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:40.359
You've always been beneath me.

39
00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:44.469
You know what?

40
00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:45.469
You're right.

41
00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:47.700
We're not the same kind of people.
