1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
It's getting late. I need to sleep.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,820
You don't really want to sleep, do you?

3
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:11,740
Go back to your room.

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:24,140
We're wearing a pair of blue earrings that night.

5
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,300
Blue earrings?

6
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:35,880
I mean, I might have a pair, but, you know, with everything that's happened, the moon and getting settled in, I'm not totally sure where I do ask.

7
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:43,700
I can go now. Emily, Emily, please escort Ms. Archer to her room.

8
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:49,960
Chloe, you're a guest in this house.

9
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,960
You have to stay out of my private quarters. Is that clear?

10
00:00:52,960 --> 00:01:15,260
Tim and wife, it's so weird over earrings.

11
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:19,260
Ava, you scheming bitch. You left your earring for him to find.

12
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:22,260
Do you think we're playing Cinderella?

13
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:25,260
Well, it's midnight. Ball's over, bitch.
