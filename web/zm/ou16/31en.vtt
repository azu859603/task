00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:02.839
We need to talk

2
00:00:02.839 --> 00:00:09.390
Now I may be poor, but I still play the rent and over the key

3
00:00:09.869 --> 00:00:12.259
I'm sorry

4
00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:18.780
Look we be both said things that we didn't mean yesterday. I didn't tell you about my boyfriend cuz I didn't want you to worry

5
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.739
That's not all

6
00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:23.850
My else are you here?

7
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.199
To apologize

8
00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:28.839
I brought a peace offering

9
00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:37.219
I accept your apology, but you know, I don't care about that stuff. I care about you

10
00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.420
I'm a lot more stable now, and I can cover the rent. What does our CEO have you doing that you're making so much money?

11
00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:47.020
What you working on?

12
00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.979
Just this presentation I've been working on for over a week

13
00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.740
We have a super important meeting this afternoon with JP G's chairman. My boss asked me to handle it

14
00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.619
Wow sounds like you're his right hand not just a secretary

15
00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:07.379
I guess it would be the dream job if Christine would stop picking on me. She keeps trying to get me fired

16
00:01:07.379 --> 00:01:12.140
She is I mean, that's terrible. Can she even do that?
