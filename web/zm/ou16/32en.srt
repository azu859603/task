1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,520
Not if Edmond has my back.

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,780
You're calling him Edmond?

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:06,780
How?

4
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:08,779
Really fallen for him, haven't you?

5
00:00:08,779 --> 00:00:12,320
I mean, royal title doesn't make him a good guy.

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,320
Just be careful, Ava.

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,089
He's just my boss.

8
00:00:17,089 --> 00:00:18,089
That's all.

9
00:00:18,089 --> 00:00:20,089
Besides, he has a girlfriend.

10
00:00:20,089 --> 00:00:22,910
So...

11
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:27,910
I just got this new dress that would go perfectly with those blue earrings your mom got you for Christmas.

12
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:28,910
Could I borrow them?

13
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:31,679
You're living the high life now.

14
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,679
Why do you want my earrings?

15
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:35,679
And I only have one left, unfortunately.

16
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:37,679
Oh, that's fine. That's the new trend.

17
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:57,420
Please, make sure to give it back to me. It means a lot.

18
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,420
Yeah, of course.

19
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:03,240
Well, I've got to go.

20
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,239
You use that limb?

21
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,780
I'll take this off your hands.

22
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:09,870
It reminds me of you.

23
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:13,760
Okay.

24
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,760
Sure.
