00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,120
Is this some sort of revenge thing for firing you? I'm calling security.

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,119
No need. My boyfriend owns the place.

3
00:00:10,119 --> 00:00:13,970
Boyfriend.

4
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:18,379
Yeah? I'm Edmond Sinclair's a live-in girlfriend.

5
00:00:18,379 --> 00:00:28,769
I told you. I'm Edmond Sinclair's live-in girlfriend.

6
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:35,640
So what brings you here, Miss Archer?

7
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,740
I thought that would change the tenor of this conversation.

8
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,799
I heard you want to get rid of Ava Grant.

9
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:43,799
And I heard the two of your best friends.

10
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:48,060
Not anymore. She seduced Edmond last night in our living room.

11
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:50,060
I knew there was something up with her.

12
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:53,600
What can I do? Edmond will never let me fire her.

13
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,109
Well, he can't protect her if she keeps messing up her job.

14
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:05,209
I have a feeling that today's important meeting may be a little more dramatic than expect.
