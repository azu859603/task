1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Of course. From now on, it will be in charge of the entire collaboration project.

2
00:00:09,289 --> 00:00:12,289
Young lady, you have a bright future ahead of you.

3
00:00:13,289 --> 00:00:15,289
I really appreciate it, Mr. Harrington.

4
00:00:15,289 --> 00:00:20,480
Sir, I don't mean to speak out of turn, but I don't have much experience.

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,480
I do want me to take this on.

6
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,859
Because I see the potential in you.

7
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,899
And you remind me of my daughter.

8
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:29,899
Does she work at the company?

9
00:00:29,899 --> 00:00:32,899
No, I haven't seen her in years.

10
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:37,600
I thought after my son's accident she would resurface.

11
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:44,859
I've tried to find her, but I think she stays away from me because she hates me.

12
00:00:45,859 --> 00:00:47,109
I doubt that.

13
00:00:47,109 --> 00:00:51,979
I think if you're meant to find each other, you will.

14
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:53,979
I hope so.

15
00:00:53,979 --> 00:01:00,539
Would I be fortunate enough to invite you to dinner sometime, Miss Ava?

16
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:04,250
Of course. It would be my honor.

17
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:19,129
Stop thinking about it. I'm taking you out to eat to celebrate the deal with Clifford.

18
00:01:19,129 --> 00:01:21,129
Pick anything you want.

19
00:01:21,129 --> 00:01:24,909
Of course.

20
00:01:24,909 --> 00:01:27,579
I'll drive so you don't change your mind.
