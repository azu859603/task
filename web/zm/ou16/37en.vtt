00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.100
How'd it go? Is she gone for good?

2
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:04.099
No.

3
00:00:04.099 --> 00:00:06.099
She's actually become the Project Leader.

4
00:00:06.099 --> 00:00:09.099
And your boyfriend's taken up to celebrate.

5
00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:10.099
What the hell?

6
00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:11.099
Just the two of them?

7
00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.099
Or are we going to kill that bitch?

8
00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:15.099
Don't resort to murder.

9
00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:16.100
Just yet.

10
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.149
I have another idea.

11
00:00:19.149 --> 00:00:23.000
We have arrived.

12
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
You sure were in the right place?

13
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.420
I don't see many restaurants.

14
00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:34.170
This is my favorite restaurant.

15
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.399
Sorry, I didn't realize you meant something so...

16
00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:41.750
Don't you worry.

17
00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.939
Excuse me.

18
00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:46.939
These are the best tacos in LA.

19
00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:50.000
You may have dined with royalty, but you've never had these.

20
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Every time something happy would happen, my mom would bring me here.

21
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.060
No way.

22
00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.899
Is it your first time having a taco?

23
00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:04.790
I suppose today was my first time.

24
00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.890
Well, then there's a first time for everything in your race.

25
00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.890
Let's go.

26
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.939
My lady?
