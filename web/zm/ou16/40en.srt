1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:02,690
You're actually fun when you're out of the office.

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:05,250
Mom, now I know what you really think about it.

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:08,509
I must say this, Barbara Cohen seemed interesting.

4
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:11,210
It's Barbara Cohen, and you'll love it.

5
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:12,210
Barbara Cohen.

6
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:13,210
Yeah.

7
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:15,679
Oh.

8
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:28,219
I asked why you're so determined to keep this hotel.

9
00:00:28,219 --> 00:00:33,420
Well, my dad let my mom design one of our hotels.

10
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,820
This was the one.

11
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,149
She poured all her love into it.

12
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:41,689
It was the last and only hotel she

13
00:00:41,689 --> 00:00:45,649
had but designed before she passed.

14
00:00:45,649 --> 00:00:52,380
I used to ride around the lobby on the roller carts.

15
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:55,399
I'm sorry.

16
00:00:55,399 --> 00:01:03,140
I know what it feels like to lose someone you love.

17
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:14,290
She has late stage brain cancer, and she's barely awake now.

18
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:15,290
I'll have a bite of that.
