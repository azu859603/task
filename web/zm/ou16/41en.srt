1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:06,740
No. No, I don't know what you mean.

2
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,580
I'm the Presidential Suite.

3
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:13,820
I leave work every day.

4
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:17,820
I'm not going to be renting Presidential suites.

5
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:24,379
I guess I was wrong with that.

6
00:00:24,379 --> 00:00:36,539
This is the necklace I had custom made for Vic's 12th birthday.

7
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:38,539
How does Ava have it?

8
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:40,539
Find out who she really is.

9
00:00:40,539 --> 00:00:51,320
I made you shots. Try one. Tell me what you like.

10
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,530
What's that?

11
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:56,530
Oh, the earring?

12
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:58,530
I was so out of it when you asked me about it last night.

13
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,530
I totally forgot what you were talking about.

14
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:02,530
Do you remember it, don't you?

15
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:04,530
I was wearing them the night we met.

16
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:08,530
I lost the other one, but I figured it symbolized our meeting,

17
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:10,530
so I thought I'd wear it anyway.

18
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:11,530
You like?

19
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,530
It was you.

20
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:16,900
What do you mean?

21
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:19,480
Nothing. Wait here.

22
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,799
Now you have no reason to doubt me.
