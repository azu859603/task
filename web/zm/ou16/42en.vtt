00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:05.769
You found it! Oh my gosh, this is like a real fairy tale.

2
00:00:05.769 --> 00:00:09.769
The prince putting his glass sliver on his true Cinderella.

3
00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:11.769
Can you put it on me?

4
00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:13.800
So they can be reunited by you.

5
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:24.820
Chloe, I offered you a place to stay here temporarily.

6
00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.820
You've been here a month. I think you should move out.

7
00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.820
What's wrong? Why are you being so cold out?

8
00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.820
I lost my job because of you.

9
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.549
I offered to give you a new one.

10
00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:38.869
I'd like you to leave first thing tomorrow morning.

11
00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:42.869
You want me and the baby out? Fine. We'll leave tomorrow.

12
00:00:42.869 --> 00:00:45.030
Hey, what? What do you mean, baby?
