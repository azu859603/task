1
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:04,990
Okay, what was so urgent that I needed to get here right away?

2
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:12,910
Povered Harrington from JPG, has invited Ava to a private dinner at his house tonight.

3
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:14,990
What? Why?

4
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:22,269
Why would a stubborn asshole who's been hell-bent on acquiring Enlottel suddenly changes attitude

5
00:00:22,269 --> 00:00:29,730
for that bitch? Because what's between her legs? That's why.

6
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,750
I can't believe she knew that love.

7
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:37,149
Clinging on to Edmund now seducing Clifford, he's old enough to be your grand father.

8
00:00:37,789 --> 00:00:42,240
As soon the whole world will know she's a whore. Kate's already falling.

9
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,939
I think I've fallen through someone I shouldn't.

10
00:00:55,969 --> 00:01:00,210
When I was young, I fell in love with a man no one wanted me to be with.

11
00:01:02,049 --> 00:01:08,930
Dad? But he was the perfect guy. He was. And he was our family's driver.

12
00:01:11,019 --> 00:01:15,709
Hey, why didn't you have a driver? I never told you this.

13
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:24,930
I was born into a wealthy family. When I ran away with your father, I gave up everything.

14
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:34,400
But I never regretted it for a second. So, Ava, if you love someone, be brave.

15
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:40,030
And if you need help being brave, just look at that lock.

16
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:47,040
I'll always be with you. Don't say that. You're with me now.

17
00:01:50,450 --> 00:02:02,159
Mr. Harrington? What are you doing here? Mr. Harrington? What are you doing here?

18
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:21,439
I shouldn't have kicked you off. I'm sorry we lost so much time.

19
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:38,000
What's going on? I am on each other to rely on.

20
00:02:41,710 --> 00:03:05,120
You're gonna be your best. No more Mr. Harrington.

21
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:13,789
Actually true. He's meeting her mother. I've been here for a while. It's really comfortable.

22
00:03:13,789 --> 00:03:16,990
That house up there is beautiful. Yeah, it is. Fountain over here.

23
00:03:18,189 --> 00:03:32,500
It's still surreal how I found you two. You know Ava, I'd like you to inherit JPG.

24
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:42,430
And we should make our relationship public. I appreciate it. But I'm not ready for everyone

25
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:46,349
to know. And besides, I'm not ready to leave. I'm a hotel just yet.

26
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:56,539
You mean you're not ready to leave, Edmund. I understand. Just let me know when you're ready.

27
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,360
Look, two flights to Seattle. We have a visit with a pondering hotel.

28
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,509
Were you? You were going with me. You were going with me.

29
00:04:54,139 --> 00:04:58,300
You accidentally slept with your boss twice in a month? What is wrong with you?

30
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:03,379
Whatever happened last night? Just forget about it.

31
00:05:05,069 --> 00:05:14,240
You don't remember what happened last night. What was that? Give you a key.

32
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:36,079
Ava, what are you doing? After all.

33
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:49,620
If we really feel... It looks like my night just got better.

34
00:05:51,060 --> 00:06:25,579
What do you say? Come on! I like to kill them. So we didn't...

35
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:29,839
We didn't know. We did the other time though.

36
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:42,589
What? I'm not sure what you're talking about. It looks like my night just got better.

37
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:48,670
It looks like my night just got better. Do you like tequila? Do you like tequila?

38
00:06:52,939 --> 00:06:55,100
You weren't the mysterious woman that night.

39
00:06:55,889 --> 00:07:02,689
That Mr. Sinclair. I think you had to meet him these with someone else. I think I'd remember if we...

40
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:18,300
You know. Honestly, a bit disappointed. I've been trying to ignore my feelings, but I care about you, Ava.

41
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:33,180
Why shouldn't we? You know why. I just want to be talked to you to dream beside you and to explore

42
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:39,980
your life to shield you from the sorrows of this world.

43
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:51,920
What am I supposed to do? Be your mistress? What about your girlfriend? What about your girlfriend?

44
00:07:53,839 --> 00:08:07,139
She's... I'm pregnant. It's complicated. So then this isn't happening, and the only relationship

45
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:20,529
between us is a professional. Excuse me. I meant... I'll have you shirt dry cleanser.

46
00:08:20,529 --> 00:08:28,079
I didn't even kiss him in the house for two days. Do you know where he is?

47
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:31,600
You should probably ask your best friend. She's traveling with him.

48
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,330
What the hell? They're together all the time now.

49
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:40,190
Probably sharing a hotel room this very moment.

50
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:43,870
Wernie Slett, it's none of your school room cliffer. Now you have to end in two...

51
00:08:45,389 --> 00:08:50,909
Um, ma'am. That vase was acquired by Mr. Sinclair at an auction for two million dollars.

52
00:08:51,470 --> 00:09:08,539
Make it so hot.

53
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:10,379
Me.

54
00:09:10,379 --> 00:09:16,399
What have you done? What have you done? You lost your mind.

55
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:23,779
Oh my god, and I'm so sorry, are you okay? I... pregnancy hormones, you know. I just get so sad

56
00:09:23,779 --> 00:09:30,179
when you're not home. Where have you been? On a business trip. With that little bitch.

57
00:09:30,179 --> 00:09:33,220
You know, I think it's time that we talk about our future.

58
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,980
I think we should get married as soon as possible for the baby.

59
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:39,700
For the long day of traveling, I need some rest.

60
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:44,509
I really will. Where's my balls?

61
00:09:45,389 --> 00:09:50,700
I'm afraid. I'm afraid madam knocked it over.

62
00:09:52,899 --> 00:10:03,419
It wasn't intentional. I was just holding it in my basement.

63
00:10:03,419 --> 00:10:08,460
Smirk all you want, dumbass maid. I'll fire you when I'm with Duchess.

64
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:25,299
The reason she became host of her annual prince is because bitch was death.

65
00:10:25,299 --> 00:10:30,159
She's ruthless. Doesn't she care that he has girlfriend? No.

66
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,940
She even seduced him, or right in front of her.

67
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:37,259
And there's something else about her.

68
00:10:37,259 --> 00:10:38,299
Something else about her.

69
00:10:39,309 --> 00:10:41,789
She hooked up JPG's chairman.

70
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:50,720
No fucking way. Gross. At least I think there's a heart.

71
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:57,440
Mr. Sinclair, you wanted to see me?

72
00:10:58,539 --> 00:10:59,740
Yes. It's for you.

73
00:11:01,259 --> 00:11:01,980
What's this for?

74
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,490
Well, today's a big day. We're leaving the press conference.

75
00:11:06,129 --> 00:11:07,169
So you should look upon.

76
00:11:11,409 --> 00:11:16,539
Wow. This is gorgeous. I've never worn anything this beautiful.

77
00:11:16,539 --> 00:11:18,210
Good. Wear it.

78
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,700
Nail the press conference.

79
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,340
I will, sir.

80
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:23,600
This just came from Mr. Harrington.

81
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,200
Or Eva.

82
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,320
Apparently, Mr. Harrington also thinks that it was too clean.

83
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:37,299
Go get ready. We saw in a now on.

84
00:11:42,659 --> 00:11:45,139
Sir, why is Harrington sending your secretary gifts?

85
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:50,480
To a little strange. I don't pay you to go subject.

86
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:57,389
Photographic evidence is much more impactful.

87
00:11:57,389 --> 00:12:05,629
All of the shareholders will be at the press conference this afternoon.

88
00:12:07,549 --> 00:12:10,509
We will make sure Eva is destroyed.

89
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:15,580
Once this gets out, Clifford Harrington will have no choice but to distance himself

90
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:19,580
from Eva to protect his reputation, and Edmund will be done with her.

91
00:12:20,769 --> 00:12:24,450
Well, in that case, there is no need for the disguise, Duchess.

92
00:12:26,259 --> 00:12:30,450
Your competition is about to lose, and your position is secure.

93
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:36,429
Chloe, I'm doing here.

94
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:40,110
Eyes just here for lunch.

95
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:42,750
At our office building?

96
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,580
Why didn't you tell me? We could catch up.

97
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:49,789
How do you have both of my earrings?

98
00:12:49,789 --> 00:12:51,330
You only let you one.

99
00:12:52,049 --> 00:12:54,210
I lost the other one that night at the hotel of Edmund.

100
00:13:01,169 --> 00:13:02,450
I'll take this off your hands.

101
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:10,159
I paid for your little hotel room and cleaned up your mess with your special guest.

102
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:11,200
There was a millionaire?

103
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,960
A trillionaire, actually.

104
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:17,200
I didn't want you to feel bad because he's everything you ever wanted.

105
00:13:18,139 --> 00:13:18,779
It was you.

106
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,120
You're the girl who moved in with Edmund.

107
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,990
That's what Edmund said.

108
00:13:25,549 --> 00:13:27,149
That he was still someone else for me.

109
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:30,269
You've been pretending to be me since that night.

110
00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:31,070
I have to tell him.

111
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:31,789
Wait, wait, wait.

112
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:34,639
It was an accident.

113
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:41,009
I was trying to help you, and we fell for each other.

114
00:13:41,009 --> 00:13:44,940
I wish I could give you everything back, but it's complicated now.

115
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,100
It's not just about you.

116
00:13:47,659 --> 00:13:49,100
I'm done taking care of you.

117
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,710
I'm having this baby.

118
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,370
You're pregnant?

119
00:13:54,370 --> 00:14:01,389
If you do, he's gonna leave me and the baby, and I can't be a single mom.

120
00:14:01,389 --> 00:14:02,429
I don't know how to do that.

121
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:04,909
Chloe, you're such a fool.

122
00:14:04,909 --> 00:14:07,809
This is the only thing I've ever wanted.

123
00:14:07,809 --> 00:14:11,059
Please, please take care of him.

124
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:12,179
I like you always do.

125
00:14:14,059 --> 00:14:20,639
Please let me have a promise I won't tell him.

126
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,759
I'll quit after the press conference, and I'll never see him again.

127
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,629
So, I'm so sorry about everything that I've done to you.

128
00:14:33,629 --> 00:14:36,980
You'll always be my best friend.

129
00:14:36,980 --> 00:15:00,049
Is that the same secretary?

130
00:15:02,509 --> 00:15:05,309
My skirt looks absolutely incredible today.

131
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,110
Okay, she's wearing the dress sent by Mr. Harrington.

132
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:16,500
First off, I want to thank you all for attending our press conference.

133
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:20,690
I am thrilled to announce the strategy collaboration

134
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:22,850
between M Hotel and JPG.

135
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:27,789
As you all know, this has been a huge undertaking.

136
00:15:27,789 --> 00:15:29,870
I didn't know that cow could clean up that well.

137
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:34,190
And we are glad to have finally reached an agreement with JPG

138
00:15:34,269 --> 00:15:38,830
and welcome Mr. Harrington and his company into our family.

139
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:57,460
What's happening?

140
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,879
Is your Clifford Harrington's mistress and you've been spying on M Hotel's?

141
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:05,570
What?

142
00:16:06,529 --> 00:16:08,769
How much Clifford pay you to steal?

143
00:16:08,769 --> 00:16:09,250
Nothing.

144
00:16:09,809 --> 00:16:10,929
Are you crazy?

145
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:12,529
This woman is trying to set me up.

146
00:16:12,529 --> 00:16:13,730
She's a liar.

147
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:14,529
I'm a liar.

148
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:21,279
Why would the chairman of JPG go to such great lengths for mere secretary unless he was screwing?

149
00:16:23,539 --> 00:16:24,419
Is this true?

150
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:28,980
M Hotel could not allow behavior like this.

151
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:35,169
These photos don't prove anything.

152
00:16:35,169 --> 00:16:39,919
And Mr. Harrington has absolutely nothing to do with our meeting today.

153
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:40,799
Friendship.

154
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:43,120
Clifford has been paying for all of her mother's medical bills.

155
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:44,879
That's more than a friend.

156
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:50,190
Mr. Harrington and I's relationship isn't unusual.

157
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:51,870
So you finally admit it.

158
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:54,190
Miss Grant, you are fired.

159
00:16:55,299 --> 00:16:57,860
We will investigate the corporate espionage

160
00:16:58,899 --> 00:17:01,299
and our lawyers will be in touch.

161
00:17:01,779 --> 00:17:04,529
We will do no such thing.

162
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,119
She is doing the only thing.

163
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,789
Hey look at them.

164
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:20,829
I wasn't lying.

165
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:22,029
She's a whore.

166
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:27,920
How dare you talk about my granddaughter like that.

167
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,640
Granddaughter?

168
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:31,650
What the fuck?

169
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:32,849
This shit just got pretty.

170
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:39,150
I wanted to respect Ava's wishes and keep her true identity private.

171
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:42,910
But I couldn't let her reputation get ruined like this.

172
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:47,619
May I introduce Ava Harrington.

173
00:17:47,619 --> 00:17:55,279
My granddaughter and Eris and future president of JPG Hotel Group.

174
00:17:55,839 --> 00:18:07,299
Granddaughter?

175
00:18:07,299 --> 00:18:09,539
Oh my god, that's why you gave all that money to me, Mom.

176
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:13,420
I was getting the wrong information.

177
00:18:15,329 --> 00:18:21,170
How dare you frame Mrs. Grant, you wicked bitch.

178
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:24,529
You blamed her for stealing a job that you wanted.

179
00:18:24,609 --> 00:18:28,369
And then you set her up and you used me in the process.

180
00:18:28,369 --> 00:18:30,369
I never should have listened to you.

181
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:31,650
Get out.

182
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:34,769
I never want to see your disgusting face again.

183
00:18:34,769 --> 00:18:36,930
But, boss, I did exactly as you told me to.

184
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:37,970
Don't fire me.

185
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:44,019
Ava, I have always admired your talent.

186
00:18:44,019 --> 00:18:46,980
This whole situation is just a big misunderstanding.

187
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,849
Let's find out.

188
00:18:48,849 --> 00:18:49,650
I think we should.

189
00:18:50,769 --> 00:18:51,650
And you should leave.

190
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:55,180
But don't we need to finish the meeting?

191
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:56,539
Yes, we'll continue.

192
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:00,940
But without you present, you're no longer the GM.

193
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:01,740
No, no, Terrace.

194
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,269
You're fired.

195
00:19:04,269 --> 00:19:04,990
You're fired.

196
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:08,400
Well, let's just say, Claire, I think everything I've done has been for

197
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,400
in the best interest of this company.

198
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,200
You can't just kick me out of here.

199
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:13,839
Security.

200
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,880
There's one more.

201
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:28,670
Her.

202
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,599
I started investigating the moment I heard these outrageous rumors.

203
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,559
This morning, I learned that this woman and Christine

204
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,200
had been working together to destroy my granddaughter.

205
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:54,500
After everything I gave up for you, you do this to me?

206
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,059
You know me, and you lied to me like this?

207
00:19:58,049 --> 00:19:59,250
You're my best friend.

208
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:01,650
I don't even recognize you anymore.

209
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:04,609
Best friend?

210
00:20:04,609 --> 00:20:06,529
I was manipulated by Christine.

211
00:20:06,529 --> 00:20:09,089
I really thought you and Clifford were involved.

212
00:20:09,089 --> 00:20:11,250
The first time at presentation you got deleted.

213
00:20:11,329 --> 00:20:12,529
It was you, wasn't it?

214
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,049
You had Edmund.

215
00:20:14,049 --> 00:20:15,009
But that wasn't enough.

216
00:20:15,009 --> 00:20:16,849
You had to ruin my career too.

217
00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:19,809
You were the only one with access to my computer before the meeting.

218
00:20:19,809 --> 00:20:22,609
Ava, I would never do anything to her.

219
00:20:22,609 --> 00:20:23,650
You have to believe me.

220
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:25,170
No, I don't.

221
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:27,569
You lie again and again.

222
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:29,630
I don't know who you are.

223
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:30,589
I don't understand.

224
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,670
You didn't know each other.

225
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:33,470
She's my roommate.

226
00:20:34,269 --> 00:20:38,289
You told me you lived alone.

227
00:20:38,289 --> 00:20:41,730
Edmund, I didn't say anything because I didn't want to make things weird.

228
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:45,170
I think you'd like me being your secretary's best friend.

229
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:49,539
Besides, we weren't close, but we rarely know each other now.

230
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:51,779
This woman knows nothing about me.

231
00:20:51,779 --> 00:20:52,180
Nothing?

232
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,920
Chloe, I'm done being manipulated by you.

233
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,279
I don't care that you have a baby.

234
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:01,440
Edmund, it was me that night.

235
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:02,940
Not her.

236
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,700
It was you though.

237
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:11,519
Okay, maybe it was her the first night,

238
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:13,440
but it's been me ever since.

239
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,480
We have a connection-

240
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,119
Science!

241
00:21:16,619 --> 00:21:17,180
That way?

242
00:21:18,269 --> 00:21:19,069
I want you to leave.

243
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:22,190
And I don't want to see it ever again.

244
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:25,710
Her child.

245
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:27,069
There is no child.

246
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,059
We never slept together.

247
00:21:36,829 --> 00:21:37,069
Wait!

248
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,099
There's something I need back.

249
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:49,220
I don't want you having any.

250
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:49,700
You win.

251
00:21:54,339 --> 00:21:57,250
I'm going to announce my retirement

252
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:02,000
so that I can spend more time with your mom the amount.

253
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Will you take over JPG?

254
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:05,519
What do you say?

255
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:12,109
If you ever mistreat my granddaughter again,

256
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:13,789
I'll ruin you.

257
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:16,210
You have my word.

258
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:17,420
I won't let it down.

259
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:25,470
Ever ignore it, was you?

260
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,099
Excuse me, sir.

261
00:23:09,099 --> 00:23:12,000
Madam, a special delivery.

262
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:26,450
It's a handwritten letter.

263
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:30,269
Is attending our wedding?

264
00:23:30,269 --> 00:23:31,869
Sorry, I didn't say anything.

265
00:23:32,509 --> 00:23:33,710
I send him an invitation.

266
00:23:34,539 --> 00:23:36,460
Technically, he is family.

267
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:38,609
But I'm poor.

268
00:23:38,609 --> 00:23:39,009
I mean...

269
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:46,400
I know I'm a duke, but first and foremost.

270
00:24:04,829 --> 00:24:06,509
So, I have all the hotels.

271
00:24:06,509 --> 00:24:07,630
This is the high mode suite.

272
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:09,569
Exactly.
