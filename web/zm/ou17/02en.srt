00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:03,620
It's a pleasure to meet you. Ethan Foster.

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:06,030
Foster?

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,699
I thought my name might ring a bell.

4
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:09,900
No shit.

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,900
Your ex-boyfriend Mason did leave you for my sister.

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,899
Hmm, hmm. Thank you so much. For that reminder, I'd almost forgotten.

7
00:00:16,899 --> 00:00:17,929
Sorry.

8
00:00:17,929 --> 00:00:21,050
Um, I feel like I'm gonna be sick.

9
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:23,559
Did you try?

10
00:00:23,559 --> 00:00:25,070
No.

11
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:27,070
Come on, I'll give you a ride.

12
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:30,070
Oh, I think I'm all right, Mr. Foster.

13
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:31,940
Are you sure?

14
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:35,060
I know what a ride home would hear me.

15
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:37,700
My reputation precedes me.

16
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,990
Where travels fast?

17
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:41,700
Suit yourself.

18
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,530
Let's go.
