1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,679
Your father isn't arrested.

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:03,879
Charlotte, what the hell is going on?

3
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:05,080
It's all Mason's doing.

4
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,139
They were worth some project.

5
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:08,259
Someone had to swim wrong.

6
00:00:08,259 --> 00:00:10,619
And Mason's put it all on your father.

7
00:00:10,619 --> 00:00:13,660
A grateful, miserable asshole.

8
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:16,179
Her family helped build his business up from the ground.

9
00:00:16,179 --> 00:00:30,329
He doesn't know, but even I met him.

10
00:00:30,329 --> 00:00:32,070
Evil, disgusting bastard.

11
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:34,149
Chloe, what are you doing here?

12
00:00:34,149 --> 00:00:35,829
I don't even care that you cheated on me

13
00:00:35,829 --> 00:00:37,310
and immediately proposed to her.

14
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:38,149
None of that matters.

15
00:00:38,149 --> 00:00:39,070
What does matter?

16
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:41,549
Very much to me, Mason is what you're doing to my father.

17
00:00:41,549 --> 00:00:43,070
In every business venture, there's

18
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:44,390
a certain degree of risk involved.

19
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:49,399
Don't be quiet with me.

20
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:53,450
You know, someone has to take a blame for the losses.

21
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:56,390
Touch me, Mason.

22
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:01,859
You know, Chloe, I still think of you all the time.

23
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:03,140
How about this?

24
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:08,780
You be my mistress and I'll let your father out for a hook.

25
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:15,359
You're sick, Mason.

26
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:17,959
My hands are tied, then.

27
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:21,640
My only suggestion, hire a very good lawyer,

28
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,359
because your father's looking at at least a decade

29
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:26,140
behind bars.

30
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:26,819
Oh, I'm sorry.

31
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:27,659
I don't mean to laugh.

32
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:30,379
It's just, who would actually dare to take your case

33
00:01:30,379 --> 00:01:31,819
and stay in my way?

34
00:01:31,819 --> 00:01:34,579
Remember, I'm marrying Sophia Foster, the daughter

35
00:01:34,579 --> 00:01:38,099
to only the richest family in town.

36
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:41,969
Maybe her brother Ethan Foster is a brilliant attorney,

37
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:43,049
but I don't think he's going to want

38
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:47,420
to go to court against his future brother-in-law.

39
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:53,299
Ethan Foster, the guy I kissed,

40
00:01:53,299 --> 00:01:55,700
is he really the only one who could help me now?
