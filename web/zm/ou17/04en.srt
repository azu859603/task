00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,370
Do you know what I said?

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:10,169
My door is always open, Chloe.

3
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:14,710
We are not able to take your father's case. No.

4
00:00:15,189 --> 00:00:20,260
I'm sorry, Ms. Gray.

5
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,890
Please, Ms. Gray. I don't want anyone to think I have anything to do with this case.

6
00:00:41,979 --> 00:00:43,320
Mr. Foster.

7
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:49,679
You're not waiting for me, are you? I am, actually.

8
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:56,850
I just wanted to return your coat.

9
00:00:57,609 --> 00:01:02,240
Okay, thanks.

10
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:08,969
Is that all?

11
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:14,590
Mr. Foster, I need your help.
