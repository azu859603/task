00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,100
Some thugs broke into our house and took away all the cash at jewelry.

2
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:22,100
They said it's for Mason's clients, and if we don't pay them back, they will show up again.

3
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:26,350
Chloe, I'm so worried. Our bank accounts were frozen.

4
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:28,350
Now this. What are we gonna do?

5
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:39,659
I'll make some money. Uh, yes, actually, um, kinda. I have to go.

6
00:00:39,659 --> 00:00:40,659
Call me if you need anything.

7
00:00:40,659 --> 00:00:53,119
We're phones behind the pillow.

8
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:57,079
Right. Um, Mr. Foster...

9
00:00:57,079 --> 00:00:58,079
Wait.
