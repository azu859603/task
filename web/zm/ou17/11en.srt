1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,660
What am I doing? I've refused Mason, but now I'm begging for Ethan?

2
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:09,160
Mr. Foster, please. You're my only hope.

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:14,240
I'm flattered, but I'm afraid I'll have to disappoint you, Miss Gray.

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,839
My sister Sophia once tried to run away because my mother tried to break up her and Mason.

5
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:26,339
She loves the son of a bitch, and I care for her deeply.

6
00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:33,460
So, I promised myself that I wouldn't intervene in her relationship, and I won't let you do that either.

7
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:35,960
Then why did you make me drink all of that whiskey?

8
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,960
Why save me and bring me back here?

9
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,960
To reject me, insult me as this kind of sick game to you?

10
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:53,259
Should I have left you in the street? If not, then you're welcome.

11
00:00:53,259 --> 00:00:55,259
Don't forget your coat this time.

12
00:00:55,259 --> 00:01:15,260
I wasn't. I don't want to give you any other reason to pester me.

13
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:22,030
Why can't I get you out of my mind? Chloe, you make me want to play more games with you.
