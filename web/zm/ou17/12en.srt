00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:05,169
Have you heard from Manita recently?

2
00:00:05,169 --> 00:00:06,169
No.

3
00:00:06,169 --> 00:00:07,169
Great.

4
00:00:07,169 --> 00:00:11,550
Don't answer if she calls you the way she betrayed you.

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,599
Enough about me.

6
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:15,699
Tell me about Mr. Mason.

7
00:00:15,699 --> 00:00:17,739
Why is he so into you?

8
00:00:17,739 --> 00:00:21,780
My good looks, my educational background.

9
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:25,859
And he loves that I am from a decent family.

10
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,179
And of course you.

11
00:00:27,179 --> 00:00:29,140
My capable brother.

12
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:31,030
Mason admires you.

13
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:32,469
He talks about you and your friend,

14
00:00:32,469 --> 00:00:36,320
like, all the time.

15
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:42,939
Here he is.

16
00:00:42,939 --> 00:00:45,939
Ethan, nice to finally meet you in person.

17
00:00:45,939 --> 00:00:46,740
Sorry I was late.

18
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:48,939
I, uh, had a business meeting.

19
00:00:48,939 --> 00:00:50,579
I understand.

20
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:53,259
I heard about you in case.

21
00:00:53,259 --> 00:00:54,219
Tricky won the deal with.
