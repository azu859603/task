00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.160
I love her execution.

2
00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.160
Mason, you should totally ask her to play at her wedding.

3
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.429
Are you okay, babe?

4
00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:20.320
I'm fine, I...

5
00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.820
Sophia, don't you think that's a little much for the wedding?

6
00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.820
I think it's a brilliant idea.

7
00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.320
You should invite her over to the table for dessert.

8
00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.519
Talk about it then.

9
00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.020
I'm sure the violinist could play something a little more...

10
00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.119
personal and romantic for your wedding.

11
00:00:35.119 --> 00:00:37.310
I'm gonna go ask her.

12
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:43.799
Do you know her?

13
00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:44.799
Save it, Mason.

14
00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:47.630
I know you two used to date.

15
00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.780
If you're keeping my sister in the dark for her happiness,

16
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.780
I'll stay quiet.

17
00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.579
As long as you stay away from Chloe.

18
00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.579
I mean, we used to date, but did she tell you all this?

19
00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:01.579
No.

20
00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:04.189
We met the other night in a pub.

21
00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:06.420
Had a great time.

22
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.549
Your name was barely mentioned.

23
00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.549
Everyone, this is Chloe Gray.

24
00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.549
Chloe, this is my brother Ethan and my fiance.

25
00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.549
Mason.

26
00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:21.549
It's a pleasure to meet you.

27
00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:24.280
Monster.

28
00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.280
It's nice to meet you.
