00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.540
Who are you looking at, Mason?

2
00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:03.540
Sophia?

3
00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.500
We're Chloe.

4
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:15.080
Oh, my God.

5
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.079
My brother is so into you.

6
00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:19.079
Your totally is tight.

7
00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:20.079
Chloe.

8
00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:22.899
I don't think he's...

9
00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:23.899
Can I have a word with Chloe?

10
00:00:23.899 --> 00:00:26.160
In private, please.

11
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.160
I'll wait for you in the car.

12
00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.160
By the way, my brother is single.

13
00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.939
What are you doing here?

14
00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:36.939
I'm rising by a lens star.

15
00:00:36.939 --> 00:00:39.939
I was laid off because of some nasty rumors.

16
00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:40.939
Was it Mason?

17
00:00:40.939 --> 00:00:41.939
Probably.

18
00:00:41.939 --> 00:00:44.969
Look, this restaurant is the only one in town that would hire me.

19
00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.969
I didn't know you'd be here.

20
00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:48.969
If you say so.

21
00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:51.600
You're a smart girl.

22
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.729
Don't mention any of your past with Mason,

23
00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:54.729
and what is this?

24
00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:55.729
You'd break her heart.

25
00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:56.729
I won't.

26
00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:57.729
Promise.

27
00:00:57.729 --> 00:01:01.420
So, about my case?

28
00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:02.420
Not here.

29
00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.379
Come to my office tonight.
