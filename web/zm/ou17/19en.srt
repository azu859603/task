1
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:03,680
You're always getting into trouble, Chloe.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:07,679
You got some balls coming down here alone to try to be a hero.

3
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:21,899
Who said I was the one?

4
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:23,129
Well, me.

5
00:00:23,129 --> 00:00:24,129
Mr. Foster.

6
00:00:24,129 --> 00:00:37,039
How are you feeling?

7
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:40,299
My sister said you protected her from the kidnappers.

8
00:00:40,299 --> 00:00:41,299
Rather bravely.

9
00:00:41,299 --> 00:00:44,420
Is that why you're so attentive now?

10
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:46,520
Because I protected your sister.

11
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,520
Maybe so.

12
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:53,130
If you'd want to express your gratitude, then please.

13
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:55,130
Take my father's case.
