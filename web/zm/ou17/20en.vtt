00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
You really choose the worst moments to make your demands.

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.669
Suit yourself.

3
00:00:05.669 --> 00:00:07.669
I'll tell Sophia everything about Mason.

4
00:00:07.669 --> 00:00:16.660
Just when I was starting to like you, Miss Gray.

5
00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.109
Good impressions really mean that much to you?

6
00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:31.710
Let's talk business.

7
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.780
How long you're with Mason? Four years, right?

8
00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.119
Yes. Why?

9
00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:43.100
How often did you sleep together?

10
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.100
None.

11
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.859
Look, if you take my father's case, I'll leave the country before the wedding.

12
00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:52.859
And I'll never come back.
