1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,199
Do we have a deal?

2
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:05,019
Yes.

3
00:00:05,019 --> 00:00:06,019
Good.

4
00:00:06,019 --> 00:00:07,139
See, it's not.

5
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:17,780
You know the address.

6
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:18,780
Hey, Sofia.

7
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:20,980
What's a good gift idea?

8
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:22,239
Oh, my God.

9
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:24,440
Please don't tell me that Anita is back.

10
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,640
No, it's not for her.

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,640
Then who are you trying to impress?

12
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:30,640
You know what?

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,960
Forgot to ask.

14
00:00:31,960 --> 00:01:00,049
Should I take off my clothes now?

15
00:01:00,049 --> 00:01:01,049
That depends.

16
00:01:01,049 --> 00:01:03,619
Do you sleep naked?

17
00:01:03,619 --> 00:01:04,620
What?

18
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:12,280
Goodnight, Chloe.

19
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,680
Goodnight.

20
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:34,459
Do I need to teach you how to tie a tie?

21
00:01:34,459 --> 00:01:37,920
No.

22
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,319
You're going to be my plus one tonight at a dinner party.

23
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:45,769
It'll be very important people leave, so just to kill them.

24
00:01:45,769 --> 00:01:47,170
Sofia and Mason will be there, too.
