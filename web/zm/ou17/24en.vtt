00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.029
I don't know if Chloe would call us friends.

2
00:00:03.029 --> 00:00:08.339
She's my client, and Sophia's violent teacher.

3
00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:12.460
I'll catch you later.

4
00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.460
Thank you for not talking about our arrangement.

5
00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.460
Ethan? Chloe?

6
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.460
You were just talking about your Chloe.

7
00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.460
Did you know that you and Mason went to the same university?

8
00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.460
Oh, really? What a coincidence.

9
00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.460
I'm so glad to know you're doing okay, Miss Gray.

10
00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.460
I'm sorry about everything that happened during the kidnapping.

11
00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.460
I just was so, so worried about Sophia, you know.

12
00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:34.460
I understand.

13
00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.460
No, I was wondering.

14
00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.649
Did you decide in the moment,

15
00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:40.649
or did you already know that Chloe had been kidnapped

16
00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.649
when you decided to abandon her?
