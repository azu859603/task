1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:03,520
What do you mean by lost?

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,519
Well clearly, somebody doesn't want the Peter Gray case to be solved.

3
00:00:06,519 --> 00:00:09,519
So they broke in last night and stole the security footage.

4
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:13,519
The security footage is the most important piece of evidence.

5
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:14,519
Yeah.

6
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:15,519
My shit.

7
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:20,519
I'll look for some backups, but I don't think Mason would be so stupid as to leave any behind.

8
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:21,519
Be quick.

9
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:23,519
We need it before the trial.

10
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,519
This case is very important.

11
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:26,519
Make it a top priority.

12
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:28,809
Hi, Captain.

13
00:00:28,809 --> 00:00:41,399
Are you sure you want me to sell all of it?

14
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:47,399
I mean, some of these pieces have some real sentimental value, especially your mother's necklace.

15
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:49,399
That's a family air loan.

16
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:50,399
I know.

17
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,460
But we need the money to start up our new business.

18
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,460
Our own music studio.

19
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:00,899
I could lend you some money.

20
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:02,899
And we could look for an investor.

21
00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:04,900
Do you think Ethan Foster would be interested?

22
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,900
Vivian, please, I can't take your money.

23
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:08,900
Or his.

24
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:09,900
I made up my mind.

25
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,060
Okay.

26
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:18,500
Come to my office.

27
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,500
Now.
