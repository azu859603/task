00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
Chloe, I owe you an apology.

2
00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:05.480
You have no idea how worried I was

3
00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:06.799
when the housekeeper called to tell me

4
00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:09.300
that you were dying of a fever.

5
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.589
I should have noticed.

6
00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:16.179
So my father's free.

7
00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:19.309
The case is over.

8
00:00:19.309 --> 00:00:20.579
Yeah.

9
00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:24.260
And about Mason, I should have believed you.

10
00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.780
I was blinded by jealousy.

11
00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:30.179
How did you know?

12
00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.070
Sofia found out he was stalking you.

13
00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.869
He put a camera in the room and recorded everything.

14
00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:38.350
Sofia was heartbroken,

15
00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.179
but Mason's in custody now.

16
00:00:42.179 --> 00:00:50.030
So he can't hurt you anymore.

17
00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.670
Sorry she had to find out like this.

18
00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:53.710
I was an idiot.

19
00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.789
I thought that keeping her in the dark would protect her,

20
00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:03.399
but instead I hurt you both.

21
00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:05.799
So the case is over,

22
00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:10.019
and Sofia knows.

23
00:01:10.019 --> 00:01:13.180
You don't have to buy my silence anymore.

24
00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.420
It's all over now.

25
00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:33.620
Yeah, it's all over now.

26
00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.150
You asked me to move out?

27
00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:38.950
Does that mean our deal is done?
