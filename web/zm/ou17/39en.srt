00:00:08,179 --> 00:00:21,289
You should get some rest. I'll come back later.

2
00:00:21,289 --> 00:00:24,289
Mr. Foster, what brings you here?

3
00:00:24,289 --> 00:00:30,829
Wait, let me guess. You got bored and came to order Chloe around and humiliate her for fun.

4
00:00:30,829 --> 00:00:33,280
That was not my intention.

5
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,280
I very much feel that it was. So you can forget sneaking into her room and just leave.

6
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:43,710
I'd be grateful if you could help me with that.

7
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:51,570
If you think that buying her new violin is going to erase everything, I will tell you right now, it won't.

8
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:56,369
Wait a minute. Is this handmade by Giovanni DeLuca?

9
00:00:56,369 --> 00:01:05,060
There's only like, ten of these left in the world. Chloe's always dreamed of having one.

10
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:12,500
It suits her. It'd be a shame if she didn't get to try it before she sends me away. What do you think?

11
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:36,980
Try it. It's a gift for you.

12
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:45,260
I can't accept this. It's too valuable. Too precious.

13
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:48,219
Do you like it?
