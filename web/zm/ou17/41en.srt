1
00:00:02,899 --> 00:00:07,679
You should get some rest.

2
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:09,779
You just got all over a bad fever.

3
00:00:09,779 --> 00:00:21,820
I still haven't thanked you properly for saving my father.

4
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:26,699
Was that kiss just your way of saying thank you?

5
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:30,660
I don't know.

6
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,840
I don't want us to just be a contract.

7
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,060
I don't want to be your servant or your mistress.

8
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:41,789
So will you.

9
00:00:41,789 --> 00:00:45,939
Do you feel anything for me?

10
00:00:45,939 --> 00:00:46,939
Of course I do.

11
00:00:46,939 --> 00:00:49,380
Every day and every night.

12
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,579
I can't sleep without you.

13
00:00:51,579 --> 00:00:54,020
I don't think I can either.

14
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,020
You spoiled me.

15
00:00:56,020 --> 00:01:15,620
Don't leave me Chloe.

16
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:18,420
Is Ethan here?

17
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,420
No.

18
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:21,480
He's home with Miss Gray.

19
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,480
Who are you?

20
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,480
I'm his wife.

21
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,480
Anita Foster.

22
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,150
Nice to meet you.
