1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:16,379
It's sweeter than usual.

2
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:19,609
Oh my God, get a room, you two.

3
00:00:19,609 --> 00:00:23,809
Sophia, I'm sorry for not telling you about Mason.

4
00:00:23,809 --> 00:00:27,129
Chloe, I know it was my brother just trying to protect me.

5
00:00:27,129 --> 00:00:30,300
I am more than happy to get rid of that bastard.

6
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,840
And plus I have a new bestie because of it, so it was totally worth it.

7
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,640
What brings you here, Sophia?

8
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,640
Well, I wanted to check on Chloe.

9
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:43,520
You know what Mason did to you was horrible.

10
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,159
Plus, mom is holding a family dinner tonight.

11
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:48,159
I'll be there.

12
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:51,640
And I told her that you're bringing Chloe.

13
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,640
What?

14
00:00:52,640 --> 00:01:08,349
Ethan, who is this?

15
00:01:08,349 --> 00:01:10,269
Mother, this is Chloe.

16
00:01:10,269 --> 00:01:16,219
Ethan, it's been a long time.

17
00:01:16,219 --> 00:01:17,420
Have you missed me?
