You've got some nerve coming in here. You cheated on my brother, and then you bolted before the wedding. You are no lost her.

2
00:00:07.139 --> 00:00:10.140
Sit down, Sophia. Don't embarrass yourself.

3
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:16.820
I raised Anita like she was my own. My house will always be her home.

4
00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:23.940
I don't completely agree, but I guess somehow it is yours. If you'll excuse us.

5
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.730
Ethan!

6
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:37.369
Never told me you were married.

7
00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:42.490
Almost married. It was a long time ago. I need you to tell.

8
00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:54.479
I'm not interested. I'm very jealous.

9
00:00:54.479 --> 00:01:01.219
How did you say I'm your girlfriend? Am I just so excused you can send her away?
