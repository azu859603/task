1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,580
He also helped my mother with the board when my father passed away.

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:05,580
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:12,710
I need his father died, saving Sophia from drowning.

4
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:16,289
Ever since then, my mother has taken care of her.

5
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:22,120
So, you two are raised together, like family.

6
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:26,820
In a sense, we have the same rare blood type.

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,980
So, any time she was ill, I would donate blood.

8
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:32,979
That's how you two fell in love.

9
00:00:32,979 --> 00:00:42,109
You know, some people would say that you two are destined to be together.

10
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:44,109
Sophia used to think the same thing.

11
00:00:44,109 --> 00:00:48,060
And we see how that turned out.

12
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:50,420
She abandoned me at the wedding.

13
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:56,149
And I'm just not one of those people that believes in destiny or fate.

14
00:00:56,149 --> 00:00:59,719
What do you believe in?

15
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:05,400
I believe in the choices that we make.

16
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:16,180
Like my choice to kiss you right now.
