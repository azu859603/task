00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.720
Well, me and Chloe will be going now.

2
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:10.419
Ethan, wait! You're not seriously in love with her, are you?

3
00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:15.330
What if I am?

4
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.579
Ethan, I need a word with you. Now.

5
00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:25.190
Wait for me here.

6
00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:35.320
I am concerned about Anita's mental health. Her doctor says she is not doing well.

7
00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.320
Why can't you just be nicer to her like you used to be?

8
00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.320
Her condition aside, we both know Anita's not going to take no for an answer.

9
00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.640
Whatever she wants, she gets.

10
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:54.759
Maybe you're right. I spoiled her. Please try not to upset her on purpose. She's delicate.

11
00:00:54.759 --> 00:00:57.759
I won't. As long as she leaves me and Chloe alone.

12
00:00:57.759 --> 00:01:00.759
Why does this Chloe mean so much to you?
