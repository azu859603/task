1
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,900
Should you be drinking wine if you're not feeling well?

2
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:17,100
Look, I know Ethan's been playing around the last few years, but it's my fault.

3
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,329
I broke his heart.

4
00:00:19,329 --> 00:00:22,329
So don't consider yourself too special, Miss Gray.

5
00:00:22,329 --> 00:00:32,399
I mean, look at you.

6
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,399
You're just a nobody.

7
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:38,880
From a bankrupt family, a whore he's paid to sleep with.

8
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:44,420
You're gonna pour that glass of wine over your own head and say that I did it.

9
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:49,079
Chloe's just different.

10
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:53,210
Well, she's from a family that cannot benefit ours financially.

11
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:57,009
Besides, she has a reputation for dating rich men.

12
00:00:57,009 --> 00:01:00,939
Who told you that? Anita?
