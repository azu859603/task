I think Taylor is more interested in you than our business.

2
00:00:02.919 --> 00:00:05.000
That's why he asked you to bring your violin next time

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.219
and give him a private concert.

4
00:00:07.219 --> 00:00:09.580
It's just an audition.

5
00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:11.380
Anyways, it's pretty cute.

6
00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.570
And we're so close.

7
00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:22.660
That's Ethan.

8
00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.379
Come on, let's follow him.

9
00:00:24.379 --> 00:00:29.339
I don't think we should.

10
00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:30.179
I'm not.

11
00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.939
Actually, his, anything.

12
00:00:32.939 --> 00:00:36.140
I don't even really know what we are.

13
00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.810
Why are you acting so weird?

14
00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.219
It's me.

15
00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:47.679
Your wife?

16
00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:51.479
You can't keep acting like this, Anita.

17
00:00:51.479 --> 00:01:06.230
Like what?

18
00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:07.230
What's wrong?
