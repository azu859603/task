Don't want to do business with you, Mr. Foster.

2
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:07,280
Heard what she said. Sometimes it's just not about the money, right? Should we continue, Chloe?

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:12,320
I have my answer now, Chloe. I can't keep lying to you or to myself. Please.

4
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:16,449
Sorry, Taylor.

5
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:21,390
It's all right. I'll see you at the studio. Buy yourself out, Tiger.

6
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:23,230
So what did you want to tell me?

7
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:31,410
This morning when you left, I was terrified. I can't stay in the idea of losing you. I've never

8
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:42,130
met it. Anyone like you and my feelings towards you are so strange and I think I didn't know what

9
00:00:42,130 --> 00:01:04,849
those feelings were until now. I love you, Chloe. Ethan, marriage and family are so incredibly

10
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:12,879
important to me. I can't be with someone who doesn't think the same. To take it back,

11
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:14,480
that's not what you're expecting.

12
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:21,200
Will you marry me?
