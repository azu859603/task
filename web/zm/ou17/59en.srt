1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,089
Who are you marrying me?

2
00:00:03,089 --> 00:00:10,560
Yes, I'm marrying you.

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:24,260
I will be the only woman you marry, Ethan.

4
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:28,859
I'm going to make sure there is no other wedding.

5
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:30,859
You have no idea what I'm cute with alone.

6
00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:51,259
Happy Valentine's Day.

7
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:53,840
Is this an invitation, boy?

8
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,840
There's no details on it, just an address and a date.

9
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,060
That's for tonight?

10
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,130
It's a surprise.

11
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:04,129
Trying to maintain some level of mystery here.

12
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:06,420
I also have a surprise for you.

13
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,579
What is it?

14
00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:10,959
Not until tonight.

15
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:12,959
I can be quite mysterious, too.

16
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:22,000
Do you like it?

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,540
I want to make the same cake for your wedding.

18
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:39,790
Chloe?

19
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:40,790
You okay?

20
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:42,790
Ethan is going to kill me if I got you sick.

21
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:43,790
It's not the cake.

22
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:44,790
Well, are you sure?

23
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,790
Maybe I should call a doctor.

24
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:49,209
I took a test last night.

25
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:50,209
I'm pregnant.
