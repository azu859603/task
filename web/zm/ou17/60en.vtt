00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.230
Oh my God. Oh my God. I'm going to be an aunt.

2
00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:08.730
Can you give it a secret?

3
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.230
I want to wait until even tonight during our Valentine's Day day.

4
00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:18.129
Then you used to call me a hopeless romantic. Please, deal.

5
00:00:18.129 --> 00:00:22.480
Maybe I should just stay with you until Ethan comes back.

6
00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.480
Don't overreact, Aunt Sophia.

7
00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.480
Besides, what bad things could happen in just a few hours.

8
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:36.820
How's it going over there?

9
00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:42.859
All done. The roses are set in the studio you bought for us, and the fireworks are set to go off at midnight.

10
00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:48.710
Thank you so much. I hope she likes it.

11
00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.939
She's going to love it. You should keep doing things like this.

12
00:00:52.939 --> 00:01:11.980
Mother.

13
00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:19.239
Anita's in the hospital. She attempted suicide and has lost a lot of blood. You are her only hope.
