00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:10,220
Where are you, Ethan?

2
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:12,220
We're having a baby.

3
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:17,620
We're gonna be parents. I can't wait to tell you.

4
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:21,989
I should have known Anita was up to something.

5
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:25,600
Thank you for doing this for her.

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,050
It makes me happy seeing how much you care for her.

7
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:33,689
And I'm sure Anita will feel the same way when she wakes up.

8
00:00:33,689 --> 00:00:37,100
I can't stay alone. I have a date with Chloe.

9
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:47,060
Sorry, I'm not in the office. Building's closed.

10
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,500
Oh, I see.

11
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,100
Sound upset.

12
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:58,850
No, but thanks for telling me.
