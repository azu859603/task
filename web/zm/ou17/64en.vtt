00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.720
You can't keep playing the sick game in here.

2
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.780
If you hurt yourself again, I will happily watch you die.

3
00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:09.980
No, you won't.

4
00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.099
You still love me.

5
00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:14.099
That's why you always come on a call.

6
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:22.219
I'm a wedding ring.

7
00:00:22.219 --> 00:00:23.219
Remember?

8
00:00:23.219 --> 00:00:26.219
Remember how you told me you loved me when you gave it to me?

9
00:00:26.219 --> 00:00:28.260
You're my husband.

10
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
Mine! Not Chloe Grace!

11
00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.259
The only reason I asked you to marry me is because it's what you and Mother wanted.

12
00:00:34.259 --> 00:00:39.700
You'd be my trophy wife right now if you hadn't left on a wedding day.

13
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.700
Let's face it, Anita. We were never a loving cop.

14
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:43.700
I don't believe you.

15
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.700
Marriage is nothing more than a pile of signed paper.

16
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:47.700
No!

17
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.700
Marriage can be broken at any time for any number of you.

18
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:50.700
You told me you loved me!

19
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.979
That was just a familiar fantasy.

20
00:00:56.979 --> 00:01:03.950
So what does her engagement mean to you then?

21
00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.140
Another fantasy?
