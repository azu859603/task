00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:02,940
Chloe, what are you doing here?

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:09,259
Our engagement, our marriage, what?

3
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:12,259
Some pretty little lie to keep me around?

4
00:00:12,259 --> 00:00:14,259
No, of course not.

5
00:00:14,259 --> 00:00:16,260
Yes, I've been exactly where I was.

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:17,260
You never let me...

7
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:20,620
Shut up!

8
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:23,679
I'm soaking wet, what happened?

9
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:27,120
What happened?

10
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,600
My father died, and I couldn't even be there.

11
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,600
Because I was too busy waiting for you.

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,340
I was such an idiot.

13
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:38,340
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

14
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,340
I thought that we had something real.

15
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:43,340
But apparently, it was just a big joke to you.

16
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,340
My phone died while I was giving blood.

17
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:48,979
To Anita, you chose her tonight.

18
00:00:48,979 --> 00:00:52,939
I haven't even know I'm surprised.

19
00:00:52,939 --> 00:00:54,939
It was never going to work between us anyway.

20
00:00:54,939 --> 00:00:57,130
What are you talking about?
