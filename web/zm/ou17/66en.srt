1
00:00:02,509 --> 00:00:06,179
I'm not taking that back.

2
00:00:06,179 --> 00:00:20,339
Throw it away.

3
00:00:20,339 --> 00:00:25,379
It's...

4
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:26,570
Ethan?

5
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:27,890
It's mine!

6
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:29,530
Mine wouldn't even know!

7
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:34,250
Chloe, I can't let you leave like this.

8
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:37,240
Yes, for everything we've been through.

9
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,899
I don't deserve this.

10
00:00:40,899 --> 00:00:43,320
Then let's end it.

11
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,320
Once and for all.

12
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:51,259
I only said those things to Anita because I needed to leave me alone.

13
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:53,259
To stay away from us.

14
00:00:53,259 --> 00:00:58,259
Can you look me in the eyes and tell me that you think the marriage is more than just a contract?

15
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:02,299
See, you can't eat her than our deal before.

16
00:01:02,299 --> 00:01:04,530
Look, Ethan, I get it.

17
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:08,530
What I want from marriage is something you can't give me, so it's not going to work.

18
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:10,530
It's different now because now I know how much I care.
