00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
It's different now because now I know how much I care, before I didn't.

2
00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.740
And how much?

3
00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.339
It's not just some fantasy you're trying to sell me.

4
00:00:09.339 --> 00:00:16.449
If you don't want me to pack my things, I can just go now.

5
00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:28.750
Now, just stay. Please. Chloe, you said you had a gift for me for Valentine's Day.

6
00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:29.949
What was it?

7
00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:32.189
It's not important.

8
00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.109
What was it?

9
00:00:33.109 --> 00:00:34.429
I said nothing.

10
00:00:34.429 --> 00:00:43.020
Please, don't make me beg. I hate me now.

11
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:51.100
Yes! Step back, cook cake, we fell down.

12
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.100
Are you okay?

13
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.100
Get back on my way.
