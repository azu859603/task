1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:05,099
Did you know she was pregnant?

2
00:00:05,099 --> 00:00:10,980
No. Why wouldn't she tell me that earlier?

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,980
If I'd known I'd never would have left her.

4
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:17,140
Because of her pregnancy, I can't give her any drugs.

5
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:22,140
She needs rest and 24-hour care until her fever goes down.

6
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,219
I'll stay with her.

7
00:00:25,219 --> 00:00:27,989
When do you think she'll wake?

8
00:00:27,989 --> 00:00:28,989
It depends.

9
00:00:28,989 --> 00:00:33,990
Her mind is struggling and her body needs time to recover.

10
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:37,380
They could take a few days.

11
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,049
I'll come back tomorrow.

12
00:00:40,049 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm sorry. I'm sorry for what I said.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,540
I just came out wrong. I love you.

14
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:12,659
Me, too.

15
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:17,219
Chloe, look over here. Here when you wake up.

16
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:29,150
I'm kicking Chloe home. Get him out of here.
