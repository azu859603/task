1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:06,780
You're home. I'm not going to let Ethan hurt you anymore. He's done enough.

2
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:14,029
I remember breaking up with Ethan and my baby.

3
00:00:14,029 --> 00:00:20,530
She's fine, my daughter. I think Ethan.

4
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:30,059
Do you want to see him again? I won't stop you if so, but I really don't think it's in your best interest.

5
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:39,340
Raise your child together then. She'll have the best life possible.

6
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:54,969
Can I ask you one more favor? Of course. You help me leave the country.

7
00:00:54,969 --> 00:01:05,689
We'll arrange for something as soon as the doctor allows.

8
00:01:05,689 --> 00:01:08,689
What do you mean you can't find Chloe?
