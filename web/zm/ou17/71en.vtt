1
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.500
Anita had a mental breakdown.

2
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.500
She had to be sedated and admitted into a psychiatric hospital.

3
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.500
You didn't visit her once.

4
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.500
Why should I?

5
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.500
Her father died saving Sophia's life.

6
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.500
We are supposed to be her family.

7
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.500
We... we owe her.

8
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.500
Can't you see?

9
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.660
Anita has never seen us as family.

10
00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.910
She just takes advantage of our guilt.

11
00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:32.909
No.

12
00:00:32.909 --> 00:00:35.909
No, Anita, she's a good girl.

13
00:00:35.909 --> 00:00:38.969
You two love each other.

14
00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.969
The only woman I love is Chloe, Mom.

15
00:00:41.969 --> 00:01:01.310
What did the doctor say?

16
00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:06.879
I'm afraid we'll have to wait until the baby's born.

17
00:01:06.879 --> 00:01:08.980
We can leave whenever you want.

18
00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.010
I have properties in Paris, Berlin, London.

19
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:18.079
You're the best, Vivian.

20
00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:20.079
She's giving you a hard time again.

21
00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:25.739
Would you like to see Ethan one more time before we go?
