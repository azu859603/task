00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.140
Would you like to see Ethan one more time before we go?

2
00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:25.160
He's been trying very hard to find you these past six months.

3
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:32.299
Chloe.

4
00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:36.369
Chloe Gray, do you take this man, Ethan Foster,

5
00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:41.369
to be your husband, promising to love him, comfort him,

6
00:00:41.369 --> 00:00:46.369
respect him, and care for him for the rest of your life?

7
00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:54.380
No.

8
00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.380
All alone when I needed you, kind of husbandry.

9
00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:02.219
And since you don't even believe in getting married, why are we getting married?

10
00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.340
I've made a mistake.

11
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:06.530
I'm sorry.

12
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:34.579
I think she needs you.
