1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,510
Where's Chloe?

2
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:02,640
She okay?

3
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:03,640
Not good.

4
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,639
She got really depressed with pregnancy.

5
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:10,640
Her condition is at risk the doctor had to do an emergency C-section and I don't know

6
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:11,640
I panicked.

7
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,240
You're taking away from me and this is what happens.

8
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:24,339
She insisted on keeping the baby, even though every doctor told her it was risky.

9
00:00:24,339 --> 00:00:40,219
Miss Gray is out of danger, but your daughter, my daughter, it's been a tough day for all

10
00:00:40,219 --> 00:00:42,240
of us.

11
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,210
She gets some risk, Vivian.

12
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:54,829
Call me if she wakes up.

13
00:00:54,829 --> 00:01:05,359
So much Chloe.

14
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:06,359
Even.

15
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:09,480
Where's my daughter?

16
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,519
She's an incubator.

17
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:12,519
Under medical observation.

18
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:18,189
She's so small.

19
00:01:18,189 --> 00:01:20,469
So fragile.

20
00:01:20,469 --> 00:01:25,799
You need to be prepared.

21
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:30,420
Her condition's not good.

22
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,420
The doctor says she could leave us at any moment.
