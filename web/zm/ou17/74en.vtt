00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
You're a soup, baby.

2
00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:12.099
I don't know how to live without her.

3
00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:16.890
I don't know how to do it.

4
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.890
I'm nothing else else but with runners.

5
00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:35.350
My daughter, she needs me.

6
00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.840
Chloe, wait!

7
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.840
No, no, she's leaving.

8
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.840
I can feel it.

9
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:45.840
She's okay.

10
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:46.840
She's okay.

11
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:47.840
The doctor is gonna take care of her.

12
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:48.840
No.

13
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.479
No.

14
00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:52.479
Mother, I take care of her.

15
00:00:57.259 --> 00:01:14.780
Miss Gray is experiencing severe postpartum depression.

16
00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.129
Your daughter's critical condition has taken a toll on her.

17
00:01:19.129 --> 00:01:28.569
You know, all the suggestions from the tests say that the baby probably will not pull through.

18
00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:33.180
She could remain in this condition for a long time.

19
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.340
You have to separate Miss Gray from the baby.
