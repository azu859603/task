1
00:00:02,609 --> 00:00:05,790
Where's my daughter?

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,109
Our daughter died.

3
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:11,199
No, Luke.

4
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:12,199
Is that a joke?

5
00:00:12,199 --> 00:00:17,429
She couldn't make it.

6
00:00:17,429 --> 00:00:21,670
We did everything we could.

7
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:27,679
You forgot to pull yourself together now, Chloe.

8
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:30,679
She must know that you've never wanted her.

9
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:37,009
I loved her just as much as you did.

10
00:00:37,009 --> 00:00:45,340
I don't want to see you.

11
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:46,340
Hey, Ethan.

12
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:47,340
Is she alright?

13
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:58,880
I don't think so.

14
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:04,950
Hey, Chloe, what happened?

15
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:07,780
My daughter died.

16
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:10,769
Oh, my God.

17
00:01:10,769 --> 00:01:13,629
I'm so sorry, Chloe.

18
00:01:13,629 --> 00:01:14,629
I want to leave.

19
00:01:14,629 --> 00:01:17,849
Leave town.

20
00:01:17,849 --> 00:01:22,180
There's nothing left for me here.

21
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:25,400
I'll arrange a private jet for us.

22
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,400
But only if you're sure this is what you truly want.

23
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,670
Can't stand.

24
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:37,640
Staying here.

25
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,640
There's...

26
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,120
Where's the patient?
