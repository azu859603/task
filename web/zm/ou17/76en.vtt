She just checked out and left with her friend.

2
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.239
I just don't know if I made the right decision.

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:21.059
It's best for Ms. Gray to stay away.

4
00:00:21.059 --> 00:00:24.670
You know, we should go shopping after this.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:32.590
Cheers. Cheers.

Harris is such a great place to lift your spirits.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.490
You look fantastic now.

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:42.049
Ethan's been looking for you all these months,

9
00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:46.189
but don't worry, I'm going to make sure he doesn't find you.

00:00:46.189 --> 00:00:48.109
Thank you.

11
00:00:48.189 --> 00:00:50.590
Just want to forget everything that happened.

12
00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:25.180
If I have to turn the world upside down, I will find your mother.
