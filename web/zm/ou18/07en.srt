1
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,500
Did you get all the boxes I told you?

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:01:11,340
I did.

3
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,340
So if you're going to reach out of stuff now?

4
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,629
Because what the hell you scared me?

5
00:01:15,629 --> 00:01:17,629
What are these? I've never seen them before.

6
00:01:17,629 --> 00:01:20,629
It's none of your fucking business, Myra.

7
00:01:20,629 --> 00:01:22,629
I really hate this questioning attitude.

8
00:01:22,629 --> 00:01:25,790
Enough. Like I'm trying to hide something from you.

9
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:28,790
Yeah, I do feel like you're trying to hide something from me all the time.

10
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:30,790
Enough of this shit, Myra.

11
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:32,790
No, you haven't heard enough.

12
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:35,790
I still don't know why we moved to this shitty place.

13
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:39,790
I won't be stupid for taking the backseat of your stupid life.

14
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:42,790
Fuck are you seeing? Do you even hear yourself?

15
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:44,790
Why just let me go?

16
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:45,819
Myra.

17
00:01:45,819 --> 00:01:48,079
Why just let go of me?

18
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,079
Don't make me do things I don't want to.

19
00:01:51,079 --> 00:02:04,579
If you step out of that door, you know what's going to happen.

20
00:02:04,579 --> 00:02:08,219
Don't come here.

21
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:10,219
I can't even go for a fucking run, can I?
