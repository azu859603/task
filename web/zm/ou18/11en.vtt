1
00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:05.049
Oh.

2
00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:07.650
Ronald, how many times do you fuck them?

3
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:09.849
It's that's what you want.

4
00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:12.449
Why the hell have you been dragging me around?

5
00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:14.250
What am I doing here?

6
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.250
Huh?

7
00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.300
Who the thing?

8
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.500
You can't say whatever you want.

9
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.579
We both know you cannot leave me.

10
00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:29.269
No.

11
00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:30.269
They did.

12
00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.000
Put them back.

13
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.600
Yeah!

14
00:00:34.600 --> 00:02:32.830
That was nothing serious.

15
00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:39.060
Just forget about it.

16
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.500
So that's our apology.

17
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.099
My allergy.

18
00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:45.699
You don't even remember.

19
00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:47.699
Ronald, don't be so fucking dramatic.

20
00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:48.900
You don't have an allergy.

21
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.699
You just get an itch.

22
00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:52.500
Do you even fucking care?

23
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.500
Look, I'm here.

24
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.349
Aren't I?

25
00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:58.150
Maybe I should fuck another woman and see if it rocks my boat.

26
00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.949
Am I enough?

27
00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:02.949
Just let's forget about it.

28
00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:04.949
Are you fucking serious right now?

29
00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:11.090
I'm not gonna let you get away with everything you want this time.

30
00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.740
Fine.

31
00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.340
I'm sure that a lot of people will appreciate your hard nipples.

32
00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:22.169
If you want to have a life, you will do as I say.

33
00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:27.129
Now, stay here and wait for me.

34
00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:28.330
Understood?

35
00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:51.560
If you want to have a life, you will do as I say.

36
00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.620
Now, stay here and wait for me.

37
00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:57.620
Understood?

38
00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:30.410
So you're a black male in the neighborhood?

39
00:04:30.410 --> 00:05:14.420
Who the fuck?

40
00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:21.079
I'm Simon.

41
00:05:21.079 --> 00:05:57.990
Who the fuck are you?

42
00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:01.389
I'm Simon.

43
00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:08.699
Looks like we're both having problems with ladies.

44
00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:14.139
Perhaps there are other places to see happiness.

45
00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:17.129
Happiness?

46
00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:20.449
It's a long stretch.

47
00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:23.339
What are your plans after dinner?

48
00:06:23.339 --> 00:06:30.040
So, you just woke up the random strangers like this.

49
00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:33.769
I'm the adventurous type.

50
00:06:33.769 --> 00:06:44.839
It seems my luck is turned around.

51
00:06:44.839 --> 00:06:49.839
You must be desperate if you're gonna pick it up after she stood up like this.

52
00:06:49.839 --> 00:06:53.920
And other time, perhaps.

53
00:06:53.920 --> 00:07:32.939
I'm sorry I'm late.

54
00:07:32.939 --> 00:07:36.100
I hate making people wait.

55
00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:39.100
Sorry, I had something much more romantic in mind.

56
00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:41.100
Why are you really?

57
00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:44.509
How come you just popped in my life?

58
00:07:44.509 --> 00:07:46.509
You mean earlier in the woods?

59
00:07:46.509 --> 00:07:47.509
No.

60
00:07:47.509 --> 00:07:49.509
I wonder if I've seen you before.

61
00:07:49.509 --> 00:07:51.509
Your face seems quite familiar.

62
00:07:51.509 --> 00:07:54.509
Maybe I'll remember if you just take off your sunglasses.

63
00:07:54.509 --> 00:07:55.509
Sorry, I can't.

64
00:07:55.509 --> 00:07:56.509
Why?

65
00:07:56.509 --> 00:07:57.509
It's my secret.

66
00:07:57.509 --> 00:08:01.639
I'm willing to share with you for one of yours in return of course.

67
00:08:01.639 --> 00:08:02.639
Fine.

68
00:08:02.639 --> 00:08:19.779
This world is all much older than people that you know, to realize.

69
00:08:19.779 --> 00:08:28.290
Sometimes things happen because they are beyond reality.

70
00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:41.559
Not even a person, but a person.

71
00:08:41.559 --> 00:08:43.559
But a person, you know.

72
00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:46.360
Reality is the light.

73
00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:48.360
We're through a real itself.

74
00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:54.580
You know, that's a show.

75
00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:56.580
It's magic.

76
00:08:58.450 --> 00:08:59.450
Your sunglasses.

77
00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:01.450
Are they still a part of the show?

78
00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:03.450
Please take them off.

79
00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:05.450
I said it I can't.

80
00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:09.539
But instead, I'll let you in another secret of mine.

81
00:09:09.539 --> 00:09:13.120
Have you ever heard of vampires?

82
00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:17.659
Just when I thought you were in a cliche.

83
00:09:17.659 --> 00:09:19.659
You won't prove.

84
00:09:19.659 --> 00:09:22.100
And I will prove it.

85
00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:27.259
But you'll have to share one of your secrets with me in return.

86
00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:40.860
Not for blood at this.

87
00:09:40.860 --> 00:10:12.779
I was expecting a cave or something when you said vampires, but this is kind of nice.

88
00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:16.490
Well, this is my cave.

89
00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:24.009
And this is the first time I'm bringing someone else with me.

90
00:10:24.009 --> 00:10:28.129
This could be a line for some rich bastard.

91
00:10:28.129 --> 00:10:31.129
But with these looks highly debatable.

92
00:10:31.129 --> 00:10:36.309
I don't like having people around for a company.

93
00:10:36.309 --> 00:10:39.750
Maybe you could try owning a pet.

94
00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:40.750
But.

95
00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:48.519
Thanks, vampire myth.

96
00:10:48.519 --> 00:10:52.940
It's the rest of your vampire clan.

97
00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:55.059
That's enough about me.

98
00:10:55.059 --> 00:10:56.059
It's your turn.

99
00:10:56.059 --> 00:10:59.340
Be ahead of the help.

100
00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:14.659
Well, I still haven't seen the proof yet.

101
00:11:14.659 --> 00:11:15.820
Go ahead.

102
00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:17.980
You will see it's you.

103
00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:19.179
I am.

104
00:11:19.179 --> 00:11:21.980
Don't believe you.

105
00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:23.259
Okay.

106
00:11:23.259 --> 00:11:24.259
It's your turn now.

107
00:11:24.259 --> 00:12:11.190
I'm actually married.

108
00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:13.440
No.

109
00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:28.139
First.

110
00:12:28.139 --> 00:12:29.139
Yes.

111
00:12:30.649 --> 00:12:31.649
Do you really feel unblun?

112
00:12:31.649 --> 00:12:35.370
I don't kill them.

113
00:12:35.370 --> 00:15:16.269
Look like dog shit.

114
00:15:16.269 --> 00:15:19.620
Thanks, Stark.

115
00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:20.620
Today is my birthday.

116
00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:23.029
You still count your birthdays?

117
00:15:23.029 --> 00:15:24.029
Really?

118
00:15:24.029 --> 00:15:27.029
It's nearly 700 years, Stark.

119
00:15:27.029 --> 00:15:30.029
And I still don't know shit about this world.

120
00:15:30.029 --> 00:15:33.029
Well, you might not see your next birthday like this.

121
00:15:33.029 --> 00:15:35.899
You're feeding yourself enough.

122
00:15:35.899 --> 00:15:38.899
Things have been going downhill lately.

123
00:15:38.899 --> 00:15:42.090
And I couldn't find out anything about not either.

124
00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:43.090
Listen, Rigo.

125
00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:44.090
You gotta be careful.

126
00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:48.120
Things are getting out of hand and the hell is about to break loose.

127
00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:50.120
You lived long enough for a vampire.

128
00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:52.759
You gotta watch your diet.

129
00:15:52.759 --> 00:15:54.559
Dark.

130
00:15:54.559 --> 00:15:56.559
I believe I found her.

131
00:15:56.559 --> 00:15:57.559
Really?

132
00:15:57.559 --> 00:15:58.720
So what about the necklace?

133
00:15:58.720 --> 00:15:59.720
Did it open?

134
00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:00.850
Not yet.

135
00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:02.850
Well, you have to be sure, Rigo.

136
00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:06.850
And you cannot be sure until the eminent responds.

137
00:16:06.850 --> 00:16:07.850
It's real.

138
00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:09.980
I'm sure about it.

139
00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:11.980
No doubt now.

140
00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:31.179
Might have come here.

141
00:16:31.179 --> 00:16:32.179
No.

142
00:16:32.179 --> 00:16:33.179
I want to talk.

143
00:16:33.179 --> 00:16:35.179
I want to sleep.

144
00:16:35.179 --> 00:16:36.179
Myra!

145
00:16:36.179 --> 00:16:39.500
Don't make me repeat myself again.

146
00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:40.500
Come here.

147
00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:48.480
Here.

148
00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:51.750
What's this?

149
00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:53.750
You want to show me your fuckbodies?

150
00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:55.750
That was nothing important.

151
00:16:55.750 --> 00:16:57.750
It was just an experience.

152
00:16:57.750 --> 00:16:59.750
I don't have the energy for this right now.

153
00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:00.750
What about you?

154
00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:03.200
What about me?

155
00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:06.579
Who the fuck sounds was it that I picked you up from?

156
00:17:06.579 --> 00:17:08.960
I told you before.

157
00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:12.960
An old friend from high school lives around and I went to visit him.

158
00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:14.960
Don't you dare try to cover your shit out.

159
00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:16.960
I told you to stay put.

160
00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:20.730
What the hell did you get out anyways?

161
00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:22.730
Why would I tell you that, huh?

162
00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:26.839
Let's see what you've been up to.

163
00:17:26.839 --> 00:17:28.839
Marcus, give me my phone.

164
00:17:28.839 --> 00:17:32.839
Marcus, do you already know all about me?

165
00:17:32.839 --> 00:17:33.839
You act like you own me.

166
00:17:33.839 --> 00:17:36.839
I don't know everything, but I'll find out.

167
00:17:36.839 --> 00:17:39.660
How do you know Vigo?

168
00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:48.420
I saw pictures of him on your computer.

169
00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:51.289
So he already got to you.

170
00:17:51.289 --> 00:17:52.349
Got to me.

171
00:17:52.349 --> 00:17:54.480
How do you know Vigo?

172
00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:55.480
Tell me.

173
00:17:55.480 --> 00:18:02.950
I was trying to protect you.

174
00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:07.259
That's why we moved here in the first place.

175
00:18:07.259 --> 00:18:30.960
You look terrible.

176
00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:32.960
Are you sure you're okay?

177
00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:36.119
I'll be fine.

178
00:18:36.119 --> 00:18:44.029
Emma, Tini, and a double mark was shot for her.

179
00:18:44.029 --> 00:18:49.029
You disgust me, but you're so hot.

180
00:18:49.029 --> 00:18:51.029
It makes up for it.

181
00:18:52.029 --> 00:18:54.029
I don't like it of you.

182
00:18:54.029 --> 00:19:01.220
You all live such short lives and still manage to spread your field their own.

183
00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:06.069
You mean like carbon footprint?

184
00:19:06.069 --> 00:19:08.069
Are you a fucking vegan?

185
00:19:08.069 --> 00:19:10.069
You didn't strike like one.

186
00:19:10.069 --> 00:19:13.069
I thought you were a Trump supporter like myself.

187
00:19:13.069 --> 00:19:16.029
But it doesn't matter.

188
00:19:16.029 --> 00:19:22.319
I've always wondered what it would be like to fuck a Democrat.

189
00:19:22.319 --> 00:20:20.559
This time I was trying to protect you from Vigo.

190
00:20:20.559 --> 00:20:23.900
He's a vampire.

191
00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:26.819
I know.

192
00:20:26.819 --> 00:20:28.240
You don't?

193
00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:30.269
And why the hell did you meet with him?

194
00:20:30.269 --> 00:20:32.269
He was honest.

195
00:20:32.269 --> 00:20:34.819
He means no harm.

196
00:20:34.819 --> 00:20:36.819
I even offered himself my blood.

197
00:20:36.819 --> 00:20:37.910
What?

198
00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:38.910
Are you serious?

199
00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:39.910
Show me the bite.

200
00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:40.910
Did he try to turn you?

201
00:20:40.910 --> 00:20:41.910
Relax!

202
00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:44.039
He didn't bite me.

203
00:20:44.039 --> 00:20:46.039
And he told me he doesn't kill for blood.

204
00:20:46.039 --> 00:20:48.039
At least not anymore.

205
00:20:48.039 --> 00:20:50.039
So that's the line of bullshit he fed you.

206
00:20:50.039 --> 00:20:58.259
If you don't believe me, go see it yourself.

207
00:20:58.259 --> 00:21:02.700
I'll send you the location.

208
00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:04.849
Go.

209
00:21:04.849 --> 00:21:05.849
You'll see it.

210
00:21:05.849 --> 00:22:10.059
Today is your lucky day.

211
00:22:10.059 --> 00:22:38.490
What's your part in this shit?

212
00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:41.700
Take a guess.

213
00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:42.700
Are you up?

214
00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:43.930
Are you back?

215
00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:45.440
Don't worry.

216
00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:50.190
I'm one of the good ones.

217
00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:51.190
Why me?

218
00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:52.289
Huh?

219
00:22:52.289 --> 00:22:54.509
What am I for you to?

220
00:22:54.509 --> 00:23:02.339
Did you know that spirits never die and they are born again and again?

221
00:23:02.339 --> 00:23:04.940
In different bodies.

222
00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:11.839
I have more than enough spiritual shit for they Marcus.

223
00:23:11.839 --> 00:23:13.839
What are you talking about?

224
00:23:13.839 --> 00:23:20.940
You were my wife 500 years ago.

225
00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:21.940
You and I.

226
00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:24.329
We reigned over Romania.

227
00:23:24.329 --> 00:23:31.230
I used to have you on my side all the time.

228
00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:34.700
But there was another man.

229
00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:37.339
Another man who wanted you.

230
00:23:37.339 --> 00:23:40.019
We go.

231
00:23:40.019 --> 00:23:45.640
One day I was away from war.

232
00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:47.960
From my castle.

233
00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:53.000
From our castle.

234
00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000
A message was delivered.

235
00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.059
The note said.

236
00:23:58.059 --> 00:24:00.059
The war has been lost.

237
00:24:00.059 --> 00:24:03.339
And I died.

238
00:24:03.339 --> 00:24:06.339
It was Vigo who sent the note.

239
00:24:06.339 --> 00:24:12.289
He just couldn't accept you were in love with me.

240
00:24:12.289 --> 00:24:16.269
You took your own life.

241
00:24:16.269 --> 00:24:19.910
Either I could make it back in time.

242
00:24:19.910 --> 00:24:22.970
In a hope to find your soul again.

243
00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:26.740
I choose to become an immortal vampire.

244
00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:30.119
But so did Vigo.

245
00:24:30.119 --> 00:24:34.119
I found you before him and protected you.

246
00:24:34.119 --> 00:24:36.180
Until now.

247
00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:43.049
I do believe you.

248
00:24:43.049 --> 00:24:48.619
But you could find a better way to keep me close than blackmailing me.

249
00:24:48.619 --> 00:24:50.619
You're right.

250
00:24:50.619 --> 00:24:55.789
I got lazy.

251
00:24:55.789 --> 00:25:48.579
I'll delete pictures now.

252
00:25:48.579 --> 00:25:50.579
You said you did it all for my own good.

253
00:25:50.579 --> 00:25:53.150
I told you everything.

254
00:25:53.150 --> 00:25:56.109
I'm just curious.

255
00:25:56.109 --> 00:25:59.210
So you fucking that guy?

256
00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:01.210
Was that for my own good too?

257
00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:04.160
Look.

258
00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:06.160
They live for hundreds of years.

259
00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:10.630
It doesn't matter after a while if it's a man or a woman.

260
00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:11.630
Please, please.

261
00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:20.200
I do feel loyal to you in my heart.

262
00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:28.599
And that should be enough.

263
00:26:28.599 --> 00:26:33.509
I guess I'm making things up.

264
00:26:33.509 --> 00:26:35.509
I'll go out for a run.

265
00:26:35.509 --> 00:26:37.509
I need some fresh air.

266
00:26:37.509 --> 00:26:39.509
This is kinda too much.

267
00:26:39.509 --> 00:26:40.509
I told you baby.

268
00:26:40.509 --> 00:26:45.589
It's not safe until I kill Vigo.

269
00:26:45.589 --> 00:26:57.099
How can you even kill a vampire?

270
00:26:57.099 --> 00:26:59.940
Can't we move to somewhere else?

271
00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:01.940
I didn't like this place anyways.

272
00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:02.940
Come here.

273
00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:04.940
He will always be one step behind.

274
00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:10.779
No matter how far we run.

275
00:27:10.779 --> 00:27:13.779
The only way out is to kill him.

276
00:27:13.779 --> 00:27:15.940
You saw what he's capable of.

277
00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:18.450
Don't you need it too?

278
00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:22.980
Blood, I mean.

279
00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:23.980
That man you saw earlier.

280
00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:24.980
Andy.

281
00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:27.839
The guy you fucked.

282
00:27:27.839 --> 00:27:29.839
He provides me.

283
00:27:29.839 --> 00:27:31.839
So that I don't have to kill people.

284
00:27:31.839 --> 00:27:34.000
With his own blood or someone else's.

285
00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.829
You know, just leave it all to me, okay?

286
00:27:37.829 --> 00:27:42.140
Can I at least have my phone back?

287
00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:51.950
Are you gonna try to run away again?

288
00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:52.950
I won't.

289
00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:59.660
I will keep it for now.

290
00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:00.660
You're dying.

291
00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:03.210
Listen, the helmet has opened.

292
00:28:03.210 --> 00:29:48.660
It is her.

293
00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:52.329
I have finally.

294
00:29:52.329 --> 00:29:58.339
I have finally found her.

295
00:29:58.339 --> 00:30:01.259
What?

296
00:30:01.259 --> 00:30:03.259
You cannot afford to get weaker now.

297
00:30:03.259 --> 00:30:04.259
You cannot die now.

298
00:30:04.259 --> 00:30:05.259
Listen to me.

299
00:30:05.259 --> 00:30:07.259
Find something to feed on.

300
00:30:07.259 --> 00:30:09.259
Find a fresh blood.

301
00:30:09.259 --> 00:30:11.259
Like, right fucking now.

302
00:30:11.259 --> 00:30:14.420
Right fucking now.

303
00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:16.420
What do you want me to do?

304
00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:29.099
He is weak now.

305
00:30:29.099 --> 00:30:35.490
Should be easy for you.

306
00:30:35.490 --> 00:30:36.490
Find somewhere quiet.

307
00:30:36.490 --> 00:30:38.579
And call me when it's done.

308
00:30:38.579 --> 00:30:39.900
Are you serious?

309
00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:41.900
How the fuck am I supposed to do that?

310
00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:42.900
Ugh, it's done.

311
00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:43.900
Are you serious?

312
00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:44.900
How the fuck am I supposed to do that?

313
00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:45.900
Ugh, Ugh, it's done.

314
00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:46.900
Are you serious?

315
00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:47.900
How the fuck am I supposed to do that?

316
00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:49.099
Ugh, Ugh is old and weak.

317
00:30:49.099 --> 00:30:53.119
Plus, you've had to send me a raise.

318
00:30:53.119 --> 00:30:54.119
Find one.

319
00:30:54.119 --> 00:31:00.029
Tell me you're gonna leave that bitch.

320
00:31:00.029 --> 00:31:02.029
When we're done with Ugh.

321
00:31:02.029 --> 00:31:03.130
Promises.

322
00:31:03.130 --> 00:31:04.130
Promises.

323
00:31:04.130 --> 00:31:06.150
Oh.

324
00:31:06.150 --> 00:31:09.200
My.

325
00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:10.200
My.

326
00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:14.759
You know what to do.

327
00:31:14.759 --> 00:31:16.240
Tell me.

328
00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:17.240
Tell me Marcos.

329
00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:19.240
Tell me you'll love me.

330
00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:21.460
Or I won't do it.

331
00:31:21.460 --> 00:32:08.640
Why you a drink?

332
00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:15.460
You look like shit.

333
00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:20.250
Same story different than.

334
00:32:20.250 --> 00:32:23.920
I'll be friends.

335
00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:37.440
I was told to hand you over.

336
00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:44.750
But now that I see you.

337
00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:47.750
I cannot see myself going through Marcos's shit deal.

338
00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:50.170
Like what?

339
00:32:50.170 --> 00:32:56.420
If you make me promise.

340
00:32:56.420 --> 00:32:58.460
I will save your life.

341
00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:05.130
What promise?

342
00:33:05.130 --> 00:33:07.130
Marcos refused to turn me.

343
00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:12.460
No matter how many times I asked him.

344
00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:14.460
I guess he did me a favor.

345
00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:22.480
If you agree to my terms.

346
00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:28.480
I will save you.

347
00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:31.859
You lost your fucking mind.

348
00:33:31.859 --> 00:33:32.859
Your choice.

349
00:33:32.859 --> 00:34:00.039
Be calm.

350
00:34:00.039 --> 00:34:02.970
It should be easy for you.

351
00:34:02.970 --> 00:34:06.970
Find somewhere quiet and calm me when it's done.

352
00:34:06.970 --> 00:34:10.449
Weco is old and weak.

353
00:34:10.449 --> 00:34:14.900
Plus, you've had to send me a raise.

354
00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:16.219
Find one.

355
00:34:16.219 --> 00:34:22.469
Tell me to be calm.

356
00:34:22.469 --> 00:34:24.730
You know what to do.

357
00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:33.460
Watch market 10.

358
00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:43.949
Still don't trust me do you bitch.

359
00:34:43.949 --> 00:34:45.980
I do trust you.

360
00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:52.170
Calm down.

361
00:34:52.170 --> 00:34:54.550
I'm just scared.

362
00:34:54.550 --> 00:35:05.719
And you're not making things easier for me to understand.

363
00:35:05.719 --> 00:35:12.880
One last thing by the one last thing.

364
00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:14.260
Take it.

365
00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:16.360
I'll be back.

366
00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:39.800
You had your chance.

367
00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:42.019
But you fucked it up.

368
00:35:42.019 --> 00:35:50.570
However, I'm the kind of person who believes in second chances.

369
00:35:50.570 --> 00:35:54.570
So, do you want me to call Marcos or not?

370
00:35:54.570 --> 00:35:56.980
Fuck you.

371
00:35:56.980 --> 00:36:01.900
I guess not then.

372
00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:06.099
It's too late now.

373
00:36:06.099 --> 00:36:07.099
Is it done?

374
00:36:07.099 --> 00:36:14.449
Are you at the location?

375
00:36:14.449 --> 00:36:15.449
I'm on my way.

376
00:36:15.449 --> 00:36:24.800
My law.

377
00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:28.570
It's all going to be over soon.

378
00:36:28.570 --> 00:36:31.570
Weco will no longer be a part of our lives.

379
00:36:31.570 --> 00:36:33.570
Doesn't mean that I can go out now.

380
00:36:33.570 --> 00:36:35.760
Just a bit more patience.

381
00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:37.860
I'm almost done.

382
00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:44.360
Hey.

383
00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:46.739
Hey.

384
00:36:46.739 --> 00:36:47.739
Are you there?

385
00:36:47.739 --> 00:36:49.659
Hello.

386
00:36:49.659 --> 00:36:52.460
I'm alone with a vampire,

387
00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:55.460
waiting another vampire in the middle of fucking nowhere.

388
00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:57.909
What could possibly go wrong?

389
00:36:57.909 --> 00:36:59.909
It's not safe here.

390
00:36:59.909 --> 00:37:00.909
Marcos, I'm telling you.

391
00:37:00.909 --> 00:37:01.909
It's really not.

392
00:37:01.909 --> 00:37:04.199
What can I do now?

393
00:37:04.199 --> 00:37:05.199
You tell me.

394
00:37:05.199 --> 00:37:10.719
Okay, good point.

395
00:37:10.719 --> 00:37:11.719
Yes, I found the keys.

396
00:37:11.719 --> 00:37:13.719
We are going to his house now.

397
00:37:13.719 --> 00:37:21.469
Meet me there.

398
00:37:21.469 --> 00:37:22.469
Such a damn shame.
