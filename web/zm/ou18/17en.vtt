00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.900
Vigga, Vigga, Vigga, are you all right?

2
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.980
I've been looking for you for a long time, Jugeta.

3
00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.469
Why didn't you tell me before?

4
00:00:18.469 --> 00:00:21.539
I had to be sure.

5
00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.670
Mark told me the whole story.

6
00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.469
He lied, of course, as he always does.

7
00:00:27.469 --> 00:00:33.679
They have only two nights to go for the blood star.

8
00:00:33.679 --> 00:00:35.679
Blood star?

9
00:00:35.679 --> 00:00:40.700
I found you just some time.

10
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.979
Or perhaps the gods are on my side for a change.

11
00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:52.479
Vigga, I don't understand. What do you mean?

12
00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:58.060
When you took care of life, I created a talisman.

13
00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:07.219
Bring you back to life, you and Marcus.

14
00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:10.219
They have been cursed since that day.

15
00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:15.599
When the blood star appears, among the three lovers,

16
00:01:15.599 --> 00:01:21.430
only those who hold the amulet will stay alive.

17
00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.430
But what has Marcus got to do with this?

18
00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.590
According to Spel, I had to sacrifice someone else.

19
00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.709
I chose Marcus, but it all went wrong.

20
00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:39.019
All three of us were cursed.

21
00:01:39.019 --> 00:01:42.019
So that's why he wants to kill you?

22
00:01:42.019 --> 00:01:49.750
If he survives the blood star, nothing will stand on his way to the Journal of Life.

23
00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:56.939
But fortunately, the talisman's has fought his two owners.

24
00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:10.490
You son of a bitch!
