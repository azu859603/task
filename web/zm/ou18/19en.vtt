00:00:06.099 --> 00:00:08.099
Of course, it's not going to be this easy.

2
00:00:09.699 --> 00:00:43.100
No, you're still hungry, Pico.

3
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:49.969
Then I'll feed you.

4
00:00:49.969 --> 00:01:00.130
The sun's about to rise.

5
00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:02.130
Why didn't you invite me?

6
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:08.219
Right.

7
00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:11.299
Many times before,

8
00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:14.140
many of you were my wife.

9
00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.140
And I wasn't a vampire.

10
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:50.579
When I came down,

11
00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.739
there is so much you forgot.

12
00:01:52.739 --> 00:01:59.650
I made you remember every moment of it.

13
00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.650
You know, the simple latest rhyme.
