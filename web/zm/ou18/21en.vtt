00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:15.449
That's when I saw the video call.

2
00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:18.969
So, what's your profession, La Pienak?

3
00:00:18.969 --> 00:00:21.289
Do I look worse than usual?

4
00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:22.929
This is supposed to be funny.

5
00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:24.929
Police have together men for fuck's sake.

6
00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:26.890
I know, I know.

7
00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.089
I had to teleport with Myra.

8
00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:30.170
You did what?

9
00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.890
I had to do it for her.

10
00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.090
When was this?

11
00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:35.289
Five hours ago.

12
00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:37.130
You shouldn't have done that thing over.

13
00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:38.369
That's dark magic.

14
00:00:38.369 --> 00:00:40.289
It can't kill your spot.

15
00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:41.770
I can't believe you're still alive.

16
00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:43.920
We have six hours.

17
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.479
What I need to do now.

18
00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:46.759
Well, like I said before,

19
00:00:46.759 --> 00:00:49.200
fresh blood, a lot of it.

20
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.640
You'll have to kill this time.

21
00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:22.480
How did I get here?

22
00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:23.599
Signal.

23
00:01:23.599 --> 00:01:37.739
I mean, to scare you.

24
00:01:37.739 --> 00:01:41.060
You don't see many people around here this late.

25
00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.760
Are you okay?

26
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.640
Just a small cat.

27
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.939
And I guess I had a bit too much drink.

28
00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:51.980
How about you?

29
00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.930
Are you all right yourself?

30
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.530
I'm not.
