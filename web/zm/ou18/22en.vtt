00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:45.350
What did you think would happen, Bigo?

2
00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.859
That I would leave you alive and have a life with you yet or forever.

3
00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:56.250
You stole my love.

4
00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.250
My life from me!

5
00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.289
That's never allowed you.

6
00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:04.290
Never!

7
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.120
Poor Bigo.

8
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.469
Does love really matter?

9
00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:12.980
You poisoned me because you can't face me.

10
00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.980
Just as you couldn't in the past.

11
00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:16.980
Yeah.

12
00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:25.760
Isn't it?

13
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:32.090
It looks like you don't have much time to figure it out.

14
00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.340
Do you?

15
00:01:33.340 --> 00:02:15.180
My wife's blood stars.

16
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.949
That's a lie.

17
00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:22.939
You die once.

18
00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:23.939
You'll do it again.

19
00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:31.379
It has all we told you tonight.

20
00:02:31.379 --> 00:03:07.340
Time's up, you fucking freak.

21
00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.580
It lost your own your way to hell.

22
00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.969
It was me who deserved Maira.

23
00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:16.969
It was me who deserved your life.

24
00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:28.759
The invincible is no more.

25
00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:34.289
Marcus's eternal reign begins.

26
00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:35.289
Marcus?

27
00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:44.810
Marcus, where are you?

28
00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:45.810
What's going on? Are you okay?

29
00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.810
I'm okay.

30
00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.379
It's all done.

31
00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:55.330
What? What do you mean?

32
00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:56.330
I kill them.

33
00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.389
We're finally rid of Count Vigo.

34
00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:02.219
But what about the curse?

35
00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:11.650
Good-bye, Count Vigo.

36
00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.650
Good-bye, my barge enemy.

37
00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.740
It will take months for you to rot and disappear.

38
00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:23.060
And I will enjoy every fucking minute of it.

39
00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:52.709
What's going on, where's Vigo?

40
00:04:52.709 --> 00:05:04.769
Vigo the invincible is no more.

41
00:05:04.769 --> 00:05:08.889
That curse of a bitch is gone forever.

42
00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:19.259
Do you remember what happened the last time I heard of this, Marcus?

43
00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:35.779
But choose Visor.

44
00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:37.779
One fateful bitch.

45
00:05:37.779 --> 00:07:17.819
Aah!

46
00:07:17.819 --> 00:07:19.819
We're not here, we're exhausted.

47
00:07:19.819 --> 00:07:21.980
Relax now.

48
00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:24.360
We all have time to talk.

49
00:07:24.360 --> 00:08:10.709
Vigo is gone.

50
00:08:10.709 --> 00:08:12.870
Gone forever.

51
00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:15.579
Do you understand?

52
00:08:15.579 --> 00:08:17.579
You fucking ungrateful bitch.

53
00:08:17.579 --> 00:08:18.579
Please bring him back.

54
00:08:18.579 --> 00:08:20.579
There must be a way.

55
00:08:20.579 --> 00:08:21.579
Tell me there is a way.

56
00:08:21.579 --> 00:08:24.740
Stop humiliating yourself like a fucking human.

57
00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:26.740
You're not one anymore.

58
00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:27.740
I love him.

59
00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:31.740
I love him so much and I remember everything now.

60
00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:34.740
And I remember that I cannot live without him.

61
00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:36.740
Shut up, Julietta.

62
00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:41.220
The blood star is ours away and we are the only two left.

63
00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:44.220
I'm making new markets.

64
00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:50.269
If you do this, I'll be yours forever.

65
00:08:50.269 --> 00:08:52.389
Stop begging.

66
00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:01.889
It's too late now.

67
00:09:01.889 --> 00:09:02.889
Don't you understand?

68
00:09:02.889 --> 00:09:06.559
I never loved you and I never will.

69
00:09:06.559 --> 00:09:08.559
You just killed him and I loved.

70
00:09:08.559 --> 00:09:09.590
Again!

71
00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:15.750
And passes.

72
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:19.419
And everyone changes.

73
00:09:19.419 --> 00:10:38.320
All will be forgiven in time.

74
00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:42.669
Let's say I'm trying to remind people of myself.

75
00:10:42.669 --> 00:11:21.950
Ita sanguinis!

76
00:11:21.950 --> 00:12:34.779
No sumus desirio!

77
00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:04.820
Demon's scissors and it's killing me.

78
00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:08.279
You're right.

79
00:14:08.279 --> 00:14:10.279
It's only half a mile of antidote.

80
00:14:10.279 --> 00:14:11.279
Fresh and clean blood.

81
00:14:11.279 --> 00:14:19.289
I'm on it.

82
00:14:19.289 --> 00:14:21.990
I call you when it's all done.

83
00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:22.990
Don't mention it.

84
00:14:22.990 --> 00:15:27.259
Am I dreaming again?

85
00:15:27.259 --> 00:15:28.259
Our sleep forever.

86
00:15:28.259 --> 00:15:52.629
Does love really matter?

87
00:15:52.629 --> 00:15:55.629
You poisoned me because you can't face me.

88
00:15:55.629 --> 00:15:58.629
Just as you couldn't in the past.

89
00:15:58.629 --> 00:16:45.980
You turned.

90
00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:49.710
I was scared.

91
00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:51.970
I told I'd never see you again.

92
00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:55.970
Nothing can separate us to the attack.

93
00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:58.159
Not even yet.

94
00:16:58.159 --> 00:17:00.480
It's only to begin to hear my love.
