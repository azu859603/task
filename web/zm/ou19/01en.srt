00:00:05,389 --> 00:00:07,389
Happy birthday, Nolan.

2
00:00:07,389 --> 00:00:10,779
I have a present for you.

3
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:14,779
Happy birthday, honey.

4
00:00:22,699 --> 00:00:27,170
Nolan, not right here.

5
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:30,579
This is a public event. I'm still your Luna.

6
00:00:30,579 --> 00:00:31,579
Not anymore.

7
00:00:31,579 --> 00:00:34,130
Nolan?

8
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:37,829
I, Nolan Heming,

9
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:39,829
Alpha of the Blue Ridge pack,

10
00:00:39,829 --> 00:00:40,829
reject to you,

11
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:42,829
will Heming about for,

12
00:00:42,829 --> 00:00:44,829
as my mate and Luna.

13
00:00:44,829 --> 00:00:45,829
Hi.

14
00:00:45,829 --> 00:00:47,829
Nolan, we've been mates for a year.

15
00:00:47,829 --> 00:00:51,829
I gave up everything for you for the pack.

16
00:00:51,829 --> 00:00:52,829
So what?

17
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:55,829
I deserve your she-wolf who matches my station.

18
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:59,149
The meal here is the daughter of our beta.

19
00:00:59,149 --> 00:01:01,729
And you're just a peasant.

20
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:06,420
Ting your child.

21
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,950
You observe my child,

22
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:11,950
except my rejection now.

23
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:18,069
Why cry?

24
00:01:18,069 --> 00:01:20,230
I know I'm hard to leave, but-

25
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:22,230
I accept your rejection.

26
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:25,129
You are a demon,

27
00:01:25,129 --> 00:01:28,129
and you deserve to be with a bitch like her.

28
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:31,620
I-

29
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:32,620
No!
