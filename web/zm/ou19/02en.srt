1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Enough!

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,429
Is that Prince Draco's?

3
00:00:05,429 --> 00:00:07,429
Out of the most powerful werewolf pack?

4
00:00:07,429 --> 00:00:11,070
I didn't know he had two of these kind of events.

5
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:29,269
Prince Draco's side didn't know you were coming.

6
00:00:29,269 --> 00:00:32,840
She's my mate. I can feel it.

7
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:38,100
I know you've been searching for her for years, but she was Alpha no one's mate.

8
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,100
I don't care.

9
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:43,500
Bring me about to cross the moon today.

10
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,820
It should be my choice for life.

11
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:52,579
Alpha, we're late for the others meeting. We need to leave.

12
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:54,579
I'm not in the mood.

13
00:00:54,579 --> 00:00:55,899
Look the boy.

14
00:00:55,899 --> 00:00:58,979
We must go.

15
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:12,340
There are elders.

16
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,340
I took the rest of my days.
