00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,769
You know what I think? I think Alvin Nolan's too nice.

2
00:00:16,769 --> 00:00:18,769
The truth is, he was just tired of you.

3
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:20,769
I don't even care about that anymore.

4
00:00:20,769 --> 00:00:22,769
You leave with my baby.

5
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:24,769
Will I? I can't make you have this child.

6
00:00:24,769 --> 00:00:26,769
It's a threat to my position.

7
00:00:26,769 --> 00:00:28,769
You took everything from me.

8
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:30,769
You were not taking anything else.

9
00:00:30,769 --> 00:00:33,770
Just die peacefully. No one cares about you.

10
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:37,310
What are you doing?

11
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:47,409
Look, look away!
