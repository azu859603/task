1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,350
Willa, Willa, Willa, Willa, Willa, Willa Minabelle for.

2
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:23,350
Who are you?

3
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:26,149
Your second chance is close by.

4
00:00:26,149 --> 00:00:29,390
He has been searching for you for the past seven years.

5
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:32,369
You're the moon goddess.

6
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:37,490
Okay, listen, that whole faded mate thing that you set me up with, it nearly got me

7
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:38,490
and my son killed.

8
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:40,890
Is that not enough for you?

9
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:42,369
I don't want a second chance.

10
00:00:42,369 --> 00:00:44,049
I don't want another faded mate.

11
00:00:44,049 --> 00:00:45,049
You understand me?

12
00:00:45,049 --> 00:00:47,530
I am done with your games.

13
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:50,649
From now on, I'm going to choose my own mates.

14
00:00:50,649 --> 00:00:52,289
Leave me and my son alone.

15
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:55,090
Tragedy is part of your fate.

16
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:59,850
Just like your upcoming happiness is part of your fate.

17
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:01,649
See?

18
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:02,649
He's waiting.

19
00:01:02,649 --> 00:01:06,900
You're not going to make another decision for me.

20
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,659
I reject him.

21
00:01:08,659 --> 00:01:10,260
Remember.

22
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,790
Black hair and red eyes.

23
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:14,989
He is noble and wears a red ring.

24
00:01:14,989 --> 00:01:17,950
He will take you to the most miraculous place.

25
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:19,670
He will meet his end.

26
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:20,670
Because of you.

27
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:34,090
Shut up!

28
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:37,439
You're not going to make another decision for me.

29
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:38,319
I reject him.
