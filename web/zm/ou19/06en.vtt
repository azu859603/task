00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
Thank you.

2
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.389
Bye.

3
00:00:06.389 --> 00:00:07.389
What's wrong?

4
00:00:07.389 --> 00:00:09.419
Is that your babysitter?

5
00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:10.419
Yeah.

6
00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:13.419
She said that three more bills came in the mail today and it's late.

7
00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:15.419
I meant wants to see me.

8
00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:16.420
Hey, don't worry.

9
00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.420
If it's a good kid, he's gonna be okay.

10
00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.420
By the way, what happened to that handsome man I introduced to you last week?

11
00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.420
Yeah, I don't know what I'm saying for that.

12
00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:26.420
I have, I'm in.

13
00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:27.420
And work.

14
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.420
And school.

15
00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:29.420
And housework.

16
00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:30.420
Student loan.

17
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.420
Alright, alright, I get it.

18
00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.420
I just think it's a waste for a girl like you to be single.

19
00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.420
You just got back into town.

20
00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:38.420
You should meet someone new.

21
00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.420
I just got out from school.

22
00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:41.420
Getting a new job.

23
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.420
And then everything is gonna change.

24
00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.049
Welcome.

25
00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:49.049
Table for one.

26
00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:51.049
By the way, we don't accept food stamps.

27
00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:52.049
Shut up, mortal.

28
00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:58.219
Here you are.

29
00:00:58.219 --> 00:00:59.219
My little gold mine.

30
00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.219
Sir, we do have security cameras.

31
00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.219
How bad we just get you a beer on the house and we'll call it a night.

32
00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:07.219
No.

33
00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:08.219
The mad is young.

34
00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:10.219
There's plenty of time to play.

35
00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:13.219
No one is going to interrupt us.
