00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Oh, good news! It appears as if that handsome stranger has returned. He's waiting for someone.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,279
He's, you know, humans no longer get their news this way, right?

3
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:20,339
Yeah. Yeah, no, I know it. It's actually been in the human world for quite some time now, so...

4
00:00:20,339 --> 00:00:23,339
Really? So what was last night about then?

5
00:00:23,339 --> 00:00:26,339
Just a brave mortal saving an innocent mortal?

6
00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:30,339
Yep. Just a simple mortal in this city.

7
00:00:30,339 --> 00:00:33,340
Well, humans don't refer to each other as mortals.

8
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:35,140
Right.

9
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:36,140
Okay, sir.

10
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:39,140
Caspian. Please.

11
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:43,140
Okay. Caspian. What can I get for you?

12
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:50,649
I love you.
