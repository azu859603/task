1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Willa, I love you.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,019
What are you doing?

3
00:00:05,019 --> 00:00:08,630
I was told humans give rings when they start relationships.

4
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:10,630
I said that we're in a relationship.

5
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:13,630
That is too fast to put it away.

6
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:14,630
Right.

7
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:15,630
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:17,629
I'm not that familiar with humans' love rituals.

9
00:00:17,629 --> 00:00:19,629
You know, our race doesn't have to do these things.

10
00:00:19,629 --> 00:00:24,629
Okay, well, our hands just touched and no red line appeared,

11
00:00:24,629 --> 00:00:26,629
so it looks like I'm not your mate.

12
00:00:26,629 --> 00:00:29,629
Perhaps you should go and find your faded mate.

13
00:00:29,629 --> 00:00:32,979
I tried.

14
00:00:32,979 --> 00:00:34,979
I tried looking for her for a long time,

15
00:00:34,979 --> 00:00:37,070
but she never came.

16
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,070
So I decided to find my own.

17
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:41,070
Why me?

18
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:49,899
Shall I compare me to Summer's Day?

19
00:00:49,899 --> 00:00:52,899
They're all more lovely and more temperate.

20
00:00:52,899 --> 00:00:54,899
They're all twins.

21
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:58,219
God, stop.

22
00:00:58,219 --> 00:01:00,950
You are embarrassing yourselves.

23
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:02,950
Do that anymore.
