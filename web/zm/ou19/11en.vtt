1
00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.640
You were embarrassing yourself.

2
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.929
Just don't do that anymore.

3
00:00:04.929 --> 00:00:08.330
Yeah.

4
00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:13.330
You know, human things are just, you know, weird, you know, that was stupid.

5
00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.529
That's my bad idea.

6
00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:20.769
Okay, sir, before you do anything else, even more stupid, can I get you anything?

7
00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:21.769
That's it.

8
00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:22.769
Casper.

9
00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.750
Mm.

10
00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.750
I guess I'll take coffee to go.

11
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:28.750
Please.

12
00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:29.750
Okay.

13
00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:30.750
Anything else?

14
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:31.750
Small.

15
00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:32.750
Real.

16
00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:33.750
Hmm.

17
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:46.659
That's not for sale.

18
00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:49.369
Thank you.

19
00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:56.140
Take that with me.

20
00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.100
Casper.

21
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.500
I think you should know that I have a son.

22
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.540
Casper.

23
00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.500
Huh?

24
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.129
I think you should know that I have a son.

25
00:01:11.129 --> 00:01:19.620
He's seven, so maybe you and I aren't the best choice for each other, but thank you.

26
00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:20.620
Okay.

27
00:01:20.620 --> 00:02:07.200
Thank you, sweetheart.

28
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.939
Did you pass your teeth?

29
00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:10.939
Mama?

30
00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:11.939
Let's go to bed.

31
00:02:11.939 --> 00:02:13.969
And I'm in a baby.

32
00:02:13.969 --> 00:02:15.409
I gotta sleep too far real fast.

33
00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:17.330
Let me do it for you.

34
00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:18.569
I can protect my pack.

35
00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:23.449
Yes, my little alpha.

36
00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:26.050
Mom, you seem tired.

37
00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.849
Do we need another member?

38
00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:29.039
I got you.

39
00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:31.159
And that is all I need.

40
00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:47.139
I hate the early morning shifts.

41
00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:48.699
I'm so cold.

42
00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:49.699
You're always cold.

43
00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:52.430
Mm.

44
00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:53.430
Oh, somewhere.

45
00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.810
I'll get that.

46
00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:56.810
Thank you.

47
00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:05.199
I don't know where you said all last night.

48
00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:06.919
Were you out there all night?

49
00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:09.020
I didn't know your schedule.

50
00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:23.460
Idiot.

51
00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:27.689
Wait, wait, please.

52
00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:31.210
I think you should know that I have a son.

53
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:40.180
He's seven, so maybe you and I aren't the best choice for each other, but thank you.

54
00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.099
I'm an answer.

55
00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:48.360
I'm an answer.

56
00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.780
And the answer is, I don't care.

57
00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.259
If you kid, I don't care.

58
00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:59.860
You don't believe in fate?

59
00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.729
I still don't care.

60
00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:06.289
All I want is to be with you.

61
00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:31.019
All I want is just one opportunity that's not it.

62
00:04:31.019 --> 00:04:33.439
You have one chance.

63
00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:37.029
Don't you dare go back on your word.

64
00:04:37.029 --> 00:05:26.800
And that's the story so far.

65
00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:27.800
What do you think?

66
00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:28.800
Pretty close.

67
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.019
Yeah?

68
00:05:30.019 --> 00:05:31.019
Prince Draco's.

69
00:05:31.019 --> 00:05:33.220
Why are you acting like a five-year-old puppy?

70
00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.500
With all due respect out for Draco's.

71
00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.019
You're not even close.

72
00:05:37.019 --> 00:05:38.019
Okay?

73
00:05:38.019 --> 00:05:39.800
What would you do?

74
00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:40.800
Just be honest.

75
00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.680
She might reject you as a stranger, but she will definitely be your main if she knows

76
00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:45.680
you're the prince.

77
00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:46.680
I don't think so.

78
00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.439
She doesn't care about those things.

79
00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:50.360
She has her own life.

80
00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.360
Like those humans.

81
00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.319
But you're the best choice on the market.

82
00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:54.319
I think you're old.

83
00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:58.639
But even if there was a case, it's not my choice to make.

84
00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:01.839
It's up to her and I'll respect that, no matter what it is.

85
00:06:01.839 --> 00:06:07.959
Oh, Draco, as much as I'm enjoying this conversation, I must say we have a very important matter

86
00:06:07.959 --> 00:06:08.959
to discuss.

87
00:06:08.959 --> 00:06:09.959
Oh, I'm out in the mood, Griffin.

88
00:06:09.959 --> 00:06:10.959
Let's figure this out first.

89
00:06:10.959 --> 00:06:11.959
Yeah?

90
00:06:11.959 --> 00:06:12.959
It's about Miss Ball for safety.

91
00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:20.939
And it are.

92
00:06:20.939 --> 00:06:27.069
The Blue Ridge back to this?

93
00:06:27.069 --> 00:06:29.329
The Blue Ridge back to this?

94
00:06:29.329 --> 00:06:31.290
Why are they hunting for Willa?

95
00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:33.250
They must have heard she move back to town.

96
00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:38.209
But EBITN shows that a leader of the Blue Ridge pack put a bounty on Miss Willemina Bell

97
00:06:38.209 --> 00:06:39.209
for.

98
00:06:39.209 --> 00:06:40.209
Must be that Luna.

99
00:06:40.209 --> 00:06:44.449
Cass, what did you do when Miss Ball for escape from that pack seven years ago?

100
00:06:44.449 --> 00:06:45.649
Electra all night.

101
00:06:45.649 --> 00:06:50.050
When I returned that morning that, that she will, what's her name, Griffin?

102
00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:51.050
Camille.

103
00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:52.050
Camille.

104
00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:53.050
That'd become the new Luna.

105
00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:54.050
Hold all the elders.

106
00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:55.050
Miss Willem.

107
00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:56.050
I'm a character.

108
00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:57.050
What a bitch.

109
00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:00.089
Griffin, take Will off the hunt list.

110
00:07:00.089 --> 00:07:05.610
Make sure all worlds know she's under my protection now.

111
00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:08.730
Take Miss Ball for off the list and send guards to protect her.

112
00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:13.610
But don't disrupt her life.

113
00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:14.610
Alpha.

114
00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:15.610
Miss Aston just took the job this morning.

115
00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:28.110
Oh no, it's your acting like Emmett.

116
00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:29.350
You waiting for your man?

117
00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:30.350
No.

118
00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:31.350
You're lying.

119
00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:33.670
You're worrying about whether or not he's going to come in here today.

120
00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:34.670
Oh, what?

121
00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:35.990
Maybe.

122
00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:39.540
Look, I am more worried about my student loans.

123
00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:44.019
If I pay them next week, I'm not going to have enough money to pay my bills.

124
00:07:44.019 --> 00:07:46.019
Aww, good girl.

125
00:07:46.019 --> 00:07:47.019
Tender bills.

126
00:07:47.019 --> 00:07:48.019
Good girl.

127
00:07:48.019 --> 00:07:49.019
Hey.

128
00:07:49.019 --> 00:07:50.019
I'm a wolf.

129
00:07:50.019 --> 00:07:51.019
Not a dog.

130
00:07:51.019 --> 00:08:06.730
Okay, well if you're a wolf, I'm super girl.

131
00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:08.769
Ball for?

132
00:08:08.769 --> 00:08:13.600
What's going on?

133
00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:14.600
What's going on?

134
00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:15.600
Callie's shush.

135
00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:17.129
Go out the back door.

136
00:08:17.129 --> 00:08:18.189
No.

137
00:08:18.189 --> 00:08:19.189
Mortal must stay.

138
00:08:19.189 --> 00:08:21.600
You seem to know me.

139
00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:22.600
Girl.

140
00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:25.480
Alpha Nolan hired a killer with a white bandana before.

141
00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.240
Yeah, are you again?

142
00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:28.879
Alpha, Luna.

143
00:08:28.879 --> 00:08:29.879
What does it matter?

144
00:08:29.879 --> 00:08:42.990
The money's still the same.

145
00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:43.990
Don't worry.

146
00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:46.350
Your son's going to do it real soon.

147
00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:54.679
You're being strong.

148
00:08:54.679 --> 00:08:56.679
But that doesn't matter.

149
00:08:56.679 --> 00:08:58.960
No one's going to save you.

150
00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:00.879
And who is going to save you?

151
00:09:00.879 --> 00:09:01.879
Zach, whoa.

152
00:09:01.879 --> 00:09:05.870
Who is going to save you?

153
00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:06.870
Exactly.

154
00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:07.870
You're late.

155
00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:08.870
Sorry, honey.

156
00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:10.610
You can suck at traffic.

157
00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:13.539
I'm going to get me a coffee.

158
00:09:13.539 --> 00:09:14.539
Chris Jacob's.

159
00:09:14.539 --> 00:09:15.539
I didn't know.

160
00:09:15.539 --> 00:09:17.980
What are you?

161
00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:19.460
Please.

162
00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:21.070
Please.

163
00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:22.070
I'm sorry.

164
00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:26.179
Are you?

165
00:09:26.179 --> 00:09:28.399
You're a werewolf?

166
00:09:28.399 --> 00:09:31.289
Chris Jacob's.

167
00:09:31.289 --> 00:09:34.120
What's going on out there?

168
00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:36.440
Something that you are better off not seeing, okay?

169
00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:40.080
You want me to give you nightmares?

170
00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:43.200
Okay, so you're a werewolf.

171
00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:45.279
Is Cass being a werewolf too?

172
00:09:45.279 --> 00:09:46.279
Oh my gosh.

173
00:09:46.279 --> 00:09:49.769
Do you guys kill vampires like in the movies?

174
00:09:49.769 --> 00:09:52.759
You almost just got killed by a werewolf.

175
00:09:52.759 --> 00:09:56.980
You're not afraid of us?

176
00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:59.200
No.

177
00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.200
I mean, hello.

178
00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:01.200
You're my best friend.

179
00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:02.440
Plus you make the best coffee in town.

180
00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:05.960
I cannot live without my werewolf coffee.

181
00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:09.039
You do know that this is instant coffee, right?

182
00:10:09.039 --> 00:10:20.830
Whatever it's in the details.

183
00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:23.879
Thank you.

184
00:10:23.879 --> 00:10:28.620
Sounds good.

185
00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:32.629
You heard?

186
00:10:32.629 --> 00:10:33.629
Sorry I didn't consider.

187
00:10:33.629 --> 00:10:38.600
Hey, right.

188
00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:40.860
I don't want to get you bloody.

189
00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:46.110
Thank you.

190
00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:47.779
Cass Pan.

191
00:10:47.779 --> 00:10:50.580
Thank you.

192
00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:51.580
Coming.

193
00:10:51.580 --> 00:11:02.399
As for out.

194
00:11:02.399 --> 00:11:08.169
Will it be with you?

195
00:11:08.169 --> 00:11:12.440
Would you go out with me?

196
00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:13.440
As my reward.

197
00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:15.620
Okay.

198
00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:16.620
Are you?

199
00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:19.580
Hard?

200
00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:20.580
That's just scratch.

201
00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:27.509
I don't think that's going out.

202
00:11:27.509 --> 00:11:28.509
Okay.

203
00:11:28.509 --> 00:11:33.179
Can't manifest why you've been in a new pocket.

204
00:11:33.179 --> 00:11:42.149
I mean, he's always hurting himself, so try to be prepared.

205
00:11:42.149 --> 00:11:52.789
We should get you out of that shirt to make sure you don't have any wounds.

206
00:11:52.789 --> 00:12:25.059
Do you think you can help me?

207
00:12:25.059 --> 00:12:26.519
Okay, folks.

208
00:12:26.519 --> 00:12:27.519
I got good news.

209
00:12:27.519 --> 00:12:28.759
Just got off the phone with the boss.

210
00:12:28.759 --> 00:12:29.759
We can leave.

211
00:12:31.399 --> 00:12:34.740
Right here.

212
00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:35.769
Come on with me tonight.

213
00:12:35.769 --> 00:12:36.769
You promised.

214
00:12:36.769 --> 00:12:38.309
Yeah.

215
00:12:38.309 --> 00:12:45.649
You have to take a shower though.

216
00:12:45.649 --> 00:12:46.649
Yeah.

217
00:12:46.649 --> 00:12:47.649
I guess I should.

218
00:12:47.649 --> 00:12:55.299
Stop worrying.

219
00:12:55.299 --> 00:13:00.039
It's actually quite enjoyable to punch in the uniform.

220
00:13:00.039 --> 00:13:02.860
It doesn't hurt at all.

221
00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:06.379
Of course you'd say that.

222
00:13:06.379 --> 00:13:07.379
The ring.

223
00:13:07.379 --> 00:13:09.379
I thought it was green.

224
00:13:09.379 --> 00:13:10.379
Mmm.

225
00:13:10.379 --> 00:13:11.379
It is.

226
00:13:11.379 --> 00:13:12.379
It's Alexandra.

227
00:13:12.379 --> 00:13:14.480
You're in during the day.

228
00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:16.769
Right at night.

229
00:13:16.769 --> 00:13:17.769
Remember.

230
00:13:17.769 --> 00:13:20.169
Black hair and red eyes.

231
00:13:20.169 --> 00:13:22.980
He is noble and wears a red ring.

232
00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:27.690
He will take you to the most miraculous place.

233
00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:37.129
Caspian, did that crazy you goddess tell you anything about your fated mate?

234
00:13:37.129 --> 00:13:41.250
Did that crazy you goddess tell you anything about your fated mate?

235
00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:43.019
No.

236
00:13:43.019 --> 00:13:44.019
Not really.

237
00:13:44.019 --> 00:13:49.559
But I'm just an ordinary wolf, so probably not even our list.

238
00:13:49.559 --> 00:13:51.740
Hmm.

239
00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:53.740
Ordinary wolf.

240
00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:55.740
Hmm.

241
00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:58.740
Of course Prince Draco's would be an ordinary wolf.

242
00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:01.370
Well, I'm sorry.

243
00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:03.370
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

244
00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:04.370
I just...

245
00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:05.370
I didn't know how to tell you.

246
00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:07.370
I don't care.

247
00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:08.370
Unbuckless.

248
00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:10.940
Just don't expect me to bow.

249
00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:14.779
Oh, you don't ever have to bow.

250
00:14:14.779 --> 00:14:15.870
Recalls.

251
00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:18.870
So, why is it that you hate the moon goddess so much?

252
00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:21.899
I guess fate's unreliable.

253
00:14:21.899 --> 00:14:23.899
So is its creator.

254
00:14:23.899 --> 00:14:27.000
She wanted a tragedy, so she made me.

255
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.000
Aye.

256
00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
Nolan Hemming, Alpha of the Blue Ridge Pack.

257
00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.000
Reject you.

258
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
Will Hemming a doll for?

259
00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.049
As my mate and Luna.

260
00:14:39.049 --> 00:14:56.340
Can I take you somewhere that your smell's so good here?

261
00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:58.340
That would make this place special to you.

262
00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:01.779
This is the only natural forest near the city.

263
00:15:01.779 --> 00:15:04.299
No pack claims this place.

264
00:15:04.299 --> 00:15:07.299
A neutral ground for all packs, I've...

265
00:15:07.299 --> 00:15:13.500
And the only place that belongs to pack was wolves.

266
00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:19.379
Especially those that live amongst humans.

267
00:15:19.379 --> 00:15:20.379
At least your marks?

268
00:15:20.379 --> 00:15:25.379
At first night that I became packless, I slept under this stream.

269
00:15:25.379 --> 00:15:30.990
Here.

270
00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:36.629
Alone?

271
00:15:36.629 --> 00:15:38.629
Seven years ago.

272
00:15:38.629 --> 00:15:41.629
You know, I always really wanted to come back here.

273
00:15:41.629 --> 00:15:44.629
It's not exactly the safest place to visit alone.

274
00:15:44.629 --> 00:15:47.009
Cass?

275
00:15:47.009 --> 00:15:51.500
Just thought I'd found you sooner.

276
00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:53.500
Cass, that's not it, you're full.

277
00:15:53.500 --> 00:16:03.480
Like a revenge for your house.

278
00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:07.559
I don't care about that anymore.

279
00:16:07.559 --> 00:16:13.580
I have my son, and he is all I need.

280
00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:20.379
Now, I have my first victory against the goddess.

281
00:16:20.379 --> 00:16:28.779
I found someone beyond my fate and mate.

282
00:16:28.779 --> 00:16:33.389
Stay with me and be my equal partner.

283
00:16:33.389 --> 00:16:36.779
As I promised, to the end of the lot.

284
00:16:36.779 --> 00:16:56.669
So your Draco's his mate?

285
00:16:56.669 --> 00:16:58.379
Hm.

286
00:16:58.379 --> 00:17:01.379
Our partner's not mates.

287
00:17:01.379 --> 00:17:04.599
Mates are like husbands and wives.

288
00:17:04.599 --> 00:17:07.599
And partners are like boyfriend girlfriend.

289
00:17:07.599 --> 00:17:09.599
My mom, I gotta take things slow.

290
00:17:09.599 --> 00:17:13.019
He is a really good partner though.

291
00:17:13.019 --> 00:17:16.019
I just don't know how him and Emmett are gonna get along.

292
00:17:16.019 --> 00:17:20.019
Where wolves are often pretty possessive.

293
00:17:20.019 --> 00:17:21.109
Damn.

294
00:17:21.109 --> 00:17:22.109
Being a mom sounds hard.

295
00:17:22.109 --> 00:17:29.579
What's wrong?

296
00:17:29.579 --> 00:17:31.579
Cass being paid my student loans.

297
00:17:31.579 --> 00:17:32.579
All of them.

298
00:17:32.579 --> 00:17:36.019
Prince comes to save the day from solved.

299
00:17:36.019 --> 00:17:37.019
What?

300
00:17:37.019 --> 00:17:38.019
What's wrong with that?

301
00:17:38.019 --> 00:17:40.059
Now you can use the money to pay off your bills.

302
00:17:40.059 --> 00:17:42.059
Why can't you follow my orders?

303
00:17:42.059 --> 00:17:43.059
You think because you're the future Luna,

304
00:17:43.059 --> 00:17:45.059
that gives you the right to contradict me?

305
00:17:45.059 --> 00:17:46.059
I'm the Alpha.

306
00:17:46.059 --> 00:17:47.059
I give the orders.

307
00:17:47.059 --> 00:17:48.059
I'm sorry.

308
00:17:48.059 --> 00:17:51.759
Alpha, no, no.

309
00:17:51.759 --> 00:17:52.759
No, this is not what I want.

310
00:17:52.759 --> 00:17:57.759
I want an equal partnership where I get to make my own calls,

311
00:17:57.759 --> 00:17:58.759
so we're gonna have a talk.

312
00:17:58.759 --> 00:17:59.759
And hold on.

313
00:17:59.759 --> 00:18:01.759
I want you to find the best design of the city.

314
00:18:01.759 --> 00:18:03.759
I want a custom dress made for Willa.

315
00:18:03.759 --> 00:18:04.759
Nothing but the best.

316
00:18:04.759 --> 00:18:06.759
Happy that, Alpha Draco.

317
00:18:06.759 --> 00:18:07.759
Shh.

318
00:18:07.759 --> 00:18:09.759
That's the 26th item on my list.

319
00:18:09.759 --> 00:18:11.759
I guarantee your mate will be terribly pleased.

320
00:18:11.759 --> 00:18:14.019
Our mates yet?

321
00:18:14.019 --> 00:18:15.019
Just partners.

322
00:18:15.019 --> 00:18:16.019
Why?

323
00:18:16.019 --> 00:18:18.019
You've been through so much together.

324
00:18:18.019 --> 00:18:20.019
Why not just tell her the truth,

325
00:18:20.019 --> 00:18:22.019
that you two are fated mates?

326
00:18:22.019 --> 00:18:24.019
It's a camera smoothin' your gun.

327
00:18:24.019 --> 00:18:25.109
Can't go another.

328
00:18:25.109 --> 00:18:27.109
Just seven years without her.

329
00:18:27.109 --> 00:18:29.529
But if the perfect moment arises,

330
00:18:29.529 --> 00:18:31.910
I'll tell her that.

331
00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:34.910
Does she know that you've ordered so many luxurious items for her?

332
00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:35.910
No, Holden.

333
00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:37.910
It's a surprise.

334
00:18:37.910 --> 00:18:39.910
Just make sure it's all here in two weeks.

335
00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:41.910
She'll create the perfect moment to tell her.

336
00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:44.910
I don't think she's the type to be swayed by nice things, Alpha Draco's.

337
00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:47.910
In fact, I don't think this is a good idea at all.

338
00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:49.910
Why don't you just tell her the truth?

339
00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:54.180
Who is it?

340
00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:55.500
Willa.

341
00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:56.500
What have you done?

342
00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:59.500
I had a girlfriend pay off her student loans yesterday.

343
00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:01.500
You are doomed.

344
00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:05.190
Pretend you're in a meeting or something.

345
00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:06.190
Willa.

346
00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:07.190
Hi.

347
00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:09.569
What?

348
00:19:09.569 --> 00:19:10.569
I'm coming down now.

349
00:19:10.569 --> 00:19:14.900
Well, it doesn't sound good.

350
00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:17.990
Just fine-griffin' and hide yourself.

351
00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:20.339
I might need you later.

352
00:19:20.339 --> 00:19:35.690
I-I need to see Caspian.

353
00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:36.750
Mr. Draco's.

354
00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:37.750
Do you have an appointment?

355
00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:38.750
No.

356
00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:39.750
But we're...

357
00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:40.750
Friends.

358
00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:41.750
Sorry, waitress.

359
00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:42.750
He's in a meeting.

360
00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:43.750
He can't see you.

361
00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:44.750
Alright.

362
00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:46.750
I'll just give him a call.

363
00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:48.750
If you need to make a call, you can do it outside.

364
00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:50.750
This isn't a place for a dishwasher.

365
00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:51.750
Casp.

366
00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:55.670
Are you in your office?

367
00:19:55.670 --> 00:19:56.670
Are you available?

368
00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:57.670
No.

369
00:19:57.670 --> 00:19:58.859
No.

370
00:19:58.859 --> 00:19:59.859
I'm in the lobby.

371
00:19:59.859 --> 00:20:01.859
Yet your receptionist won't let me through.

372
00:20:01.859 --> 00:20:06.849
Well, I guess we'll just see who gets kicked out first.

373
00:20:06.849 --> 00:20:09.849
Lady, this little joke you're playing isn't clever.

374
00:20:09.849 --> 00:20:11.849
Stop pretending like you have a millionaire boyfriend.

375
00:20:11.849 --> 00:20:13.849
If you want me to apologize to you.

376
00:20:13.849 --> 00:20:15.849
And you will apologize.

377
00:20:15.849 --> 00:20:19.440
Apologize.

378
00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:21.730
Right away.

379
00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:24.849
Sorry, Mr. Draco's.

380
00:20:24.849 --> 00:20:27.099
Not to me.

381
00:20:27.099 --> 00:20:28.099
To her.

382
00:20:28.099 --> 00:20:30.190
Miss, I'm sorry.

383
00:20:30.190 --> 00:20:31.190
Please forgive me.

384
00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:33.480
How long have you been away to darling?

385
00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:34.990
Not long.

386
00:20:34.990 --> 00:20:39.900
I'm so sorry, Miss.

387
00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:41.900
It has been a pleasure to serve you.

388
00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:44.630
Is that so hard?

389
00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:46.730
This is a will I mean a bell for?

390
00:20:46.730 --> 00:20:47.730
Memorize your face.

391
00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:49.730
It seems to be even all security clearances.

392
00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:51.859
And no matter what I'm dealing with,

393
00:20:51.859 --> 00:20:54.049
when she shows up,

394
00:20:54.049 --> 00:20:56.049
be sure to my office and be doing it.

395
00:20:56.049 --> 00:20:57.049
Yes, Mr. Draco's.

396
00:20:57.049 --> 00:21:07.329
Thank you.

397
00:21:07.329 --> 00:21:15.190
So, what brings you here today, Ivy?

398
00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:16.349
Surprise?

399
00:21:16.349 --> 00:21:17.349
Like friend?

400
00:21:17.349 --> 00:21:18.539
Martin?

401
00:21:18.539 --> 00:21:24.849
Caspian, did you pay my student loans?

402
00:21:24.849 --> 00:21:27.319
What's that, Martin?

403
00:21:27.319 --> 00:21:28.319
What's going on?

404
00:21:28.319 --> 00:21:29.319
You seem stressed.

405
00:21:29.319 --> 00:21:30.319
Casp.

406
00:21:30.319 --> 00:21:32.319
Did you pay my student loans?

407
00:21:32.319 --> 00:21:36.369
What makes you think that?

408
00:21:36.369 --> 00:21:39.819
Well, your name was on their seat.

409
00:21:39.819 --> 00:21:42.130
No.

410
00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:43.220
No.

411
00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:44.220
That's impossible.

412
00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:45.220
Yes.

413
00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:47.220
It was paid for by an organization.

414
00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:49.220
The Caspian group.

415
00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:51.220
Mr. Caspian.

416
00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:55.529
What are you looking at?

417
00:21:55.529 --> 00:21:56.529
Well, look.

418
00:21:56.529 --> 00:21:57.589
Yes.

419
00:21:57.589 --> 00:21:58.589
I'm sorry.

420
00:21:58.589 --> 00:21:59.589
I paid you certain loans.

421
00:21:59.589 --> 00:22:01.589
I sure told you.

422
00:22:01.589 --> 00:22:03.460
Why?

423
00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:07.940
Because I couldn't see you just struggle like that and do nothing.

424
00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:09.930
I love you.

425
00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:15.690
This is not how I envision this relationship.

426
00:22:15.690 --> 00:22:18.720
This is supposed to be an equal partnership.

427
00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:21.720
No one is going to make decisions for me.

428
00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:26.670
Let's just talk about this later.

429
00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:28.670
Why not wait, please?

430
00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:30.730
Please don't go.
