00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,160
Oh, hi, thank God you're here.

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,039
Thank you so much, so, so much.

3
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:10,960
You are such a lifesaver.

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,599
You have no idea how much I appreciate this.

5
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:14,519
Do you know what time you'll be?

6
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:15,839
Bye.

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:16,679
See ya.

8
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:17,679
Gonna be back.

9
00:00:22,059 --> 00:00:22,899
Hi.

10
00:00:22,899 --> 00:00:24,219
Hi.

11
00:00:24,219 --> 00:00:25,059
Hi.

12
00:00:25,059 --> 00:00:26,899
You said that already.

13
00:00:26,899 --> 00:00:28,660
Sorry.

14
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:31,600
Hi.

15
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,719
Do I fit it against?

16
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,840
Yeah, but we don't have any.

17
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,359
We have no solution.

18
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:45,740
This house is cool.

19
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:49,479
Come on, buddy.

20
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:51,200
Cass, please be patient with Emet.

21
00:00:51,200 --> 00:01:00,299
Please, please, please.

22
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:03,460
No, come on.

23
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:08,400
Come on, come on.

24
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,650
Come on, come on, come on.

25
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:14,450
All right, one more round, one more round.

26
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:17,569
Cass Bien, you said we would watch cartoons if I won.

27
00:01:17,569 --> 00:01:20,540
Well, patience, young racer.

28
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,430
OK.

29
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:25,950
One more round, and if you win, you get to watch cartoons?

30
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:26,549
OK.

31
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:29,459
I'll allow it just this round.

32
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:31,819
Pick you a racer.
