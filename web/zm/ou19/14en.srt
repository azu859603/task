1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,330
The night calls, there's only one place for the fucking town, where will the burgers,

2
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:11,929
where we take the wildest country without a legendary wolfback burger,

3
00:00:11,929 --> 00:00:19,129
sink your teeth into a beast of a burger, with a juicy maddie, melted cheese, and fresh, crisp toms.

4
00:00:19,129 --> 00:00:23,129
I thought that male werewolves were supposed to be possessive.

5
00:00:23,129 --> 00:00:33,829
Guess who we're good there?

6
00:00:33,829 --> 00:00:35,829
Let's go to another meal.

7
00:00:35,829 --> 00:00:36,829
Why not?

8
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:53,490
And he becomes Max the Whale.

9
00:00:53,490 --> 00:01:23,430
I'll show you.

10
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,590
What do you think of Emmon?

11
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:26,590
Emmon?

12
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:28,099
Amazing.

13
00:01:28,099 --> 00:01:32,099
If he was mine, he'd be my best friend.

14
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:33,099
He's a blessing.

15
00:01:33,099 --> 00:01:36,219
He really is.

16
00:01:36,219 --> 00:01:37,219
Yes.

17
00:01:37,219 --> 00:01:39,079
Yeah.

18
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:41,239
Do you really love me?

19
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:45,099
Everything about me?

20
00:01:45,099 --> 00:01:48,799
With all my heart and soul.

21
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,799
Then you were my chosen Caspian Draco's.

22
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:53,890
Mark me.
