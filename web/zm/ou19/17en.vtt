00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So the messenger blew her back immediately.

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Yes, Alpha.

3
00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.009
Alpha Nolan.

4
00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:13.359
Get out!

5
00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:16.359
Alpha Nolan, a messenger is here from the Crescent Moon pack.

6
00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:18.359
He insists on meeting with you right away.

7
00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.359
I said get out!

8
00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:21.359
Stop!

9
00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.359
Tell the messenger I'll be right there.

10
00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:24.359
Nolan?

11
00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.359
The prince is messenger. He knows this is serious.

12
00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.359
You know, Willa wouldn't be so impolite.

13
00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.359
Maybe she was the better choice.

14
00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:35.130
You're in love with that bitch!

15
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.130
You think she's better than me? What are you thinking?

16
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.130
I'm thinking. I made a mistake seven years ago.

17
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.130
She've chosen a better she will.
