1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,980
You nervous?

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:07,400
All right, all.

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:11,400
Luna, Willa, I can't believe Nolan demanded to see you all alone.

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,400
I failed my mission.

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,400
No.

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,400
I should just go there by myself.

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,399
It's not your fault.

8
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:22,640
Nolan is cool and impulsive.

9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,640
I, Nolan Heming, Alpha of the Blue Ridge Pack.

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,640
Reject to you.

11
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,640
Will Heming about for?

12
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,640
As my mate and Luna.

13
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,630
It's gonna be okay.

14
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:35,630
You're the Luna.

15
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:37,630
The future Alpha Queen.

16
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:39,729
They should be afraid of you.

17
00:00:39,729 --> 00:00:42,079
I trust you.

18
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,079
His eyes are green.

19
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,079
He can't be my faded mate.

20
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,079
Luna, Willa, Prince Drake goes.

21
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,079
It's time.

22
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,429
Hey, I'm just gonna be right.

23
00:00:52,429 --> 00:00:54,429
I'll be waiting right inside.

24
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:56,560
If anything happens, you say the word.

25
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,560
Turn this entire place down.
