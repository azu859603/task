1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:07,870
You're stronger than I thought Willabelle for, but didn't anybody ever tell you not to

2
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:09,869
play with other people's mates?

3
00:00:09,869 --> 00:00:12,509
That's really funny coming from you.

4
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:16,910
You uh, tell your little servants about your love story, or are they fucking you too?

5
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:17,910
You're pathetic.

6
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,550
No one even showed up to help you.

7
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:24,190
You're like a stray, wandering around like a beggar.

8
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,550
Get ready to die, Willabelle for.

9
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,190
Don't you dare.

10
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:34,460
It's fine.

11
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:35,460
I'm here now.

12
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:38,100
I'll kill anyone who tries to hurt you.

13
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:43,310
Dear Prince Dragos, I'm Camille, the Luna of the Blue Ridge.

14
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:44,909
We met seven years ago.

15
00:00:44,909 --> 00:00:47,149
Do you remember?

16
00:00:47,149 --> 00:00:51,950
Camille, you were charged with insulting the royal family and intentionally causing harm.

17
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:54,509
Your judgment will be delivered at the next alpha meeting.

18
00:00:54,509 --> 00:00:58,670
Insulting the royal family, Prince Dragos, I didn't insult you.

19
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:00,509
How did you become a Luna?

20
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:06,590
Miss Balfour here is the Luna of Crescent Moon and Princess of the entire race.

21
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:10,060
No, she can't be the Princess, she's just...

22
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:13,900
And as for you, Nolan, since you're an awful leader to the elders,

23
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,299
it's really a little strip of that title very soon.

24
00:01:16,299 --> 00:01:18,510
Come on, Princess, let's go.
