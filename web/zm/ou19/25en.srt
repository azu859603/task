00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I think you'd be a kind of person out of a picnic set.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Oh, yeah.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Well, it's my grandmother, so...

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Grandmothers.

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
That's about two and a year's old, so...

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Cheers.

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Cheers.

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,140
I want to show you something.

9
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:20,140
Oh, I did?

10
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:21,140
Yes, I did.

11
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:24,199
Yes, what is this?

12
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:26,969
Here, take a look.

13
00:00:26,969 --> 00:00:31,429
One minute.

14
00:00:31,429 --> 00:00:34,460
Look, that fella.

15
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:35,460
See?

16
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:42,740
I made it your shower.

17
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:47,890
God, this is the most miraculous thing I've ever seen.

18
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,560
He will take you to the most miraculous place.
