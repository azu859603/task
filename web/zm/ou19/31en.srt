1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,280
20 miles in three minutes must be a little tired to kill you

2
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:38,700
Sorry, I was late see you home trade that plane might be a little too simple for me, buddy

00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,280
Nolan's a psychopath. He's gonna do anything to hurt you. Well, that's the case

13
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,919
You're more danger than I thought

14

I need to finish him off sooner rather than later. Cass you could die

15
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:24,870
It's a small price to pay for your safety. It's okay

This is a cursed dagger one scratch will kill even the strongest of one whoops

23
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:14,370
What did you find this the King's dungeon took me a while to break in

24
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:22,340

Noble

30
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,899
Where's a red ring?

31
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:26,740
He will take you to the most miraculous place. I don't want another faded mate. You understand me

32
00:04:26,740 --> 00:05:21,980
We'll meet his end because of you who wears gasps

33
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:26,060
I'm sorry Luna. They just left. No

34
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:36,459
No, no, he's stopping. That is an order. Luna. I'm following the Alphas orders

35
00:05:36,459 --> 00:05:42,420
I don't give a fuck about the Alphas orders. You are going to stop him that idiot is gonna die

36
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:47,399
Oh my god, please don't leave me believe

37
00:05:47,399 --> 00:06:37,519
Caspian won the battle he killed no one but the best of stabbing with a fucking dagger

38
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:39,769
Luna

39
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:45,879
Alpha Drake goes lost a lot of blood. He needs a blood transfusion immediately. Then what are you waiting for do it?

40
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:49,360
There's not enough blood in the blood bank. We can't find enough blood

41
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:56,980
Take mine, but Luna. He's an alpha. He needs a lot of blood. It would be extremely dangerous that I said take mine

42
00:07:20,259 --> 00:07:21,379
Caspian

43
00:07:21,379 --> 00:07:27,410
Cass

44
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:28,910
Cass

45
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:30,910
Hey, can you hear me?

46
00:07:31,629 --> 00:07:34,189
Don't you hurry. Why are you doing anything?

47
00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:37,500

48
00:07:37,579 --> 00:07:43,060
No, you have to stay with me. You have to stay with me. Okay. This is not how our story is supposed to end

49
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:56,980
Seems like the fallen chapter for me. That's a good life. Met him by grace

50
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:04,110
Good friends

51
00:09:04,110 --> 00:10:16,519
Asteries with remembering. Take me back. Take me back to them. Let's go home. Mom was waiting. I don't believe it

52
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:20,110
It's a miracle. Alpha Drinkos is alive

53
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:49,940
You would a meteor shower some web

54
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,759
Save my life

55
00:10:53,759 --> 00:11:00,549
That's his gift power of resurrection and redemption. He's a son with the meteor

56
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:16,110
The moon goddess is greatest gift. What do you're looking at? Pretty someone in the whole world

57
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:36,100
I'm a platter. I need you to tell me something. I'm not your food in me. Yes. Yes

58
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:39,289
It's the only way I could keep you

59
00:11:40,649 --> 00:11:44,309
Sorry a lot. I love

60
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:47,539
Can't say a regret of this

61
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:52,490
Can you forgive me? What are you willing to do?

62
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:58,480
I mean, everything

63
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,159
I guess you're stuck with me then

64
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:05,299
You're my reward for all my past sufferings

65
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:29,509
I was born through and I loved it. You've got your degree a new job a husband

66
00:12:30,509 --> 00:12:32,509
It's a fairytale ending

67
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,080
No, go get your happily ever after

68
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:46,139
Well, I mean a bell for when you protect these people not only as their Luna, but as their princess

70
00:12:52,899 --> 00:13:00,399
From now on you will be the princess of all werewolves the Luna of the crescent moon

71
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:11,179
It is my absolute pleasure and honor to present my grandson

72
00:13:11,539 --> 00:13:16,019
Prince Emmet Draco's of the crescent moon path
