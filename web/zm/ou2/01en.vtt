00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.250
Are you sure we can afford to be here?

2
00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.170
This place looks expensive.

3
00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.329
Come on, Sarah, you need to relax.

4
00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:21.250
This guy ran into inviting me,

5
00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.210
set at some fancy party for people in fashion.

6
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.289
But I'm just here for the drinking and dancing.

7
00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:27.210
So cheers.

8
00:00:30.969 --> 00:00:33.450
I know I seem beside myself lately and I'm sorry.

9
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.570
It's just everything with my brother

10
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.530
and no more talking about your brother tonight.

11
00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.049
It's not your fault that he's in jail.

12
00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:43.369
Drug-businessing for everybody.

13
00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:45.490
Yeah, yeah, you're right.

14
00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:47.450
Come on, it's time to dance.

15
00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:53.780
Hey, one dance with me?

16
00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.259
No, but go with me.

17
00:00:55.259 --> 00:00:56.700
No, this is one dance, just don't do it.

18
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:57.939
I said, like, go, what's up?

19
00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:59.420
The lady said, back off.

20
00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.579
Fuck, Mr. Snyder, I just...

21
00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.500
Let's re-face again and we'll spline your brains

22
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.180
across the wall, repeat it.

23
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.030
Okay, are you okay?
