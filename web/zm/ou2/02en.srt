00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:06,080
Good morning. How did you sleep?

2
00:00:07,339 --> 00:00:09,339
Oh my god. What?

3
00:00:09,539 --> 00:00:11,140
What happened?

4
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:16,500
Mom? Is everything okay?

5
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:17,859
Sarah!

6
00:00:17,859 --> 00:00:21,309
Where the hell were you? I need you home now!

7
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:24,690
I have to go. It's my mom.

8
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:26,690
Okay. Well, what do I see again?

9
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:32,619
Um, last night was great, but it was a mistake. I'm sorry.

10
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:34,710
Okay. Well, let me drive you home.

11
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,710
I can just Uber. That's fine.

12
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:37,710
No, I insist.

13
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:54,109
Amber, what's going on?

14
00:00:54,109 --> 00:00:56,109
One step closer and I'll put some bullets in your face.

15
00:00:56,109 --> 00:00:57,240
No, please.

16
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,240
Huh. You're pretty. What's your name?

17
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,240
Just let my mom and sister go, please.

18
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,239
Your brother owed me a bunch of money for his dumb-ass guy locked up.

19
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:07,239
So, you know, I'm here to collect.

20
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:12,340
Sarah, what do you have here?
