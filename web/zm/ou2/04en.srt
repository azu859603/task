00:00:05,419 --> 00:00:07,419
Glad you're doing business with you, sir.

2
00:00:07,419 --> 00:00:19,870
My brother is in jail for selling drugs.

3
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:26,190
My dad left us when I was a baby, and my mom, well, you've met her.

4
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:28,190
That's why I try to keep you away.

5
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:31,350
I didn't want to drag you into this mess.

6
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:37,439
Well, I think we're special, and I'm not afraid of those people you're out.

7
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:43,340
Sarah, I can handle.

8
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:49,780
You're a great guy, but we're from two completely different worlds.

9
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:54,070
Sorry, but I just don't think we should see each other again.

10
00:00:54,070 --> 00:01:03,210
So this is your decision.

11
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:05,209
Goodbye, Elliot.
