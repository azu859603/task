1
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:04,349
You sure you want to go back in there?

2
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:10,750
My life's a mess right now, and I don't think it's fair to get you involved

3
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:17,339
We barely know each other like this dress costs more than everything. I've ever owned

4
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,399
combined

5
00:00:19,399 --> 00:00:22,600
Well, you don't owe me anything. Okay

6
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:27,719
Just just call me if you need me at least

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,320
please

8
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:41,350
Fuck if you've been what are you wearing just a gift some cheap counterfeit you need to chip

9
00:00:41,409 --> 00:00:43,409
In if you want to stay here, Sarah

10
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:51,490
Those could go for a few bucks for what so you can buy more booze and cigarettes you watch how you speak to me, lady

11
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:57,789
I raise this family all by myself. You wanted to sell me to the mob if it wasn't for Elliot

12
00:00:59,229 --> 00:01:04,909
So you got yourself a rich boyfriend, and now you think you're better than all of us. He's not my boyfriend

13
00:01:04,909 --> 00:01:06,829
But he's rich just ask him for money

14
00:01:06,829 --> 00:01:10,870
I'm not gonna ask him for anything, and I'm not gonna give you another dime

15
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:15,659
away from you crazy bitch home you calling crazy
