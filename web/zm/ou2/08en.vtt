You should really... get over her, boss.

2
00:00:18.649 --> 00:00:22.679
Hello? You're out there.

3
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.440
What is it, boss?

4
00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.440
Good evening, Miss Sarah. You had a vasovagal reaction.

5
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:30.940
A what?

6
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.939
A vasovagal reaction. That's when your body reacts to certain triggers caused by emotional or physical trauma.

7
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.439
And you have a big drop in blood pressure and blood flow to the brain.

8
00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:45.939
But don't worry, you're gonna be fine. We ran a myriad of different tests.

9
00:00:45.939 --> 00:00:48.439
And both you and your baby are gonna be just okay.

10
00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:49.439
What'd you say?

11
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.520
Up, baby.
