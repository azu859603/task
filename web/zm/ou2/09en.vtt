00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.449
What baby? Are you pregnant?

2
00:00:11.449 --> 00:00:16.780
Yes. It's ours.

3
00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.780
Look, I get it if you don't want to get involved.

4
00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:26.280
But I'm keeping it. And I won't be bothering you.

5
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.730
Did the doctor say you're good to go?

6
00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.949
Yeah, he said everything's fine.

7
00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:32.780
Well, let's go.

8
00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.460
Where are we going?

9
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.460
Well, we're going to get married.

10
00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:43.450
Are you sure about this?

11
00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.450
You father, I'm not going to let you risk spending a while.

12
00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.020
Congratulations.

13
00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:55.859
We need to are now officially married.

14
00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:57.859
I guess you better start calling me a husband.

15
00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:00.630
I guess I'd better start trying.

16
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:12.980
Of groceries. How can you be so irresponsible?

17
00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.590
I'm fine. Thanks for asking.

18
00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:21.459
Besides, I just got married, so I'm dumb babysitting you.

19
00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:22.459
Goodbye, Mom.

20
00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:24.579
Sarah.

21
00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:25.579
Is everything all right?

22
00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:30.439
Mommy's here. Mommy's not going to let anyone hurt you.
