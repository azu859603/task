1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.639
Do you haven't been answering my texts?

2
00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:03.560
Do you haven't picked up my calls?

3
00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.200
I thought you were a kidnapped.

4
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.440
No, I'm fine.

5
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.759
I'm at a friend's place.

6
00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:10.599
Friend?

7
00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:11.560
What friend?

8
00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:12.919
Is it someone we know?

9
00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:14.560
Um...

10
00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:15.519
Well...

11
00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:17.600
I think it's about time you show me your face.

12
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.920
Let's go out today.

13
00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.280
I want to know everything about this friend.

14
00:00:23.559 --> 00:00:25.559
So there's Elliot guy.

15
00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:27.480
You really want stories of the baby with you?

16
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.640
Yeah.

17
00:00:28.719 --> 00:00:30.800
He was actually a member of me.

18
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.560
I've been looking for you since the day I met you.

19
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:33.520
Let go of me.

20
00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.880
I'm calling that place.

21
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.090
Where is he?

22
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:38.810
Stop! Let go!

23
00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:44.079
Go!

24
00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:46.049
Elliot, help!

25
00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:54.909
Sarah's in danger.

26
00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:58.140
Cordy, what are you doing here?

27
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.619
I was on set nearby filming my new movie.

28
00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:02.250
Where should I get to in here tonight?

29
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.259
I'm sorry, I really...

30
00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:03.979
Oh, come on.

31
00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:05.420
It's been so long since I've seen you

32
00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:06.700
and I know what you've drifted apart.

33
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.739
Listen, I'm sorry, I really need to go.

34
00:01:08.739 --> 00:01:15.709
Mr. Bad, Mr. Walsh, we can't come here and save you now, can't it?

35
00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:17.150
What do you want?

36
00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.150
Just get the fuck away from me!

37
00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:20.670
We're here together.

38
00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.340
This is you and me.

39
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.340
I am the first time I saw you.

40
00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.500
I cannot wait for our wedding day.

41
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:27.780
Just leave me alone!

42
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.519
Sarah, if you harm her,

43
00:01:33.519 --> 00:01:34.799
listen to the worst day of your life,

44
00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:35.760
what do I promise you?

45
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.120
You want to watch her die?

46
00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.590
Put her down, please.

47
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.900
Here, take this.

48
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:43.939
It's going to happen a million dollars

49
00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:44.900
on it, just take it and leave.

50
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:45.859
Please leave her alone.

51
00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:48.019
Your money doesn't work this time, buddy.

52
00:01:48.019 --> 00:01:49.700
Sarah and I miss to be together.

53
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:50.420
It's going to be okay.

54
00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:51.459
You're going to be fine.

55
00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:52.260
Are you sure about that?

56
00:01:53.379 --> 00:01:54.579
Yeah, I believe so.

57
00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:55.379
One more step!

58
00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:31.389
Okay.

59
00:02:31.389 --> 00:02:47.740
Your father saved us again today.

60
00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.300
I know, cookies.

61
00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.139
I know he'll love those.

62
00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:01.550
Courtney, what do I do with pleasure?

63
00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.189
I just want to say thank you for coming to my movie premiere.

64
00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:08.699
And then I'll have to make you want to go get dinner on me?

65
00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:10.560
Thank you, Courtney.

66
00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.840
But I prefer for you to remain strictly professional.

67
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.120
If that's okay with you.

68
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.159
Is that the famous actress Courtney Clark?

69
00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:24.129
What is she doing here?

70
00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:27.759
They seem like they belong in the same world.

71
00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:34.990
Maybe a lip belongs with her instead of me.

72
00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:41.789
Hey, I made it to work so I'll see you in a bit.

73
00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:42.349
Can I come?

74
00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:48.560
I think I'm ready to work again and I would love to get out of that.

75
00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.159
I got somewhere in Monadola.

76
00:03:50.159 --> 00:04:37.019
What a surprise to see you here.

77
00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.230
Courtney?

78
00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:40.350
How sweet!

79
00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:41.069
He brought a friend.

80
00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:43.949
I'm sorry, do I know you?

81
00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:45.069
You must know me.

82
00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.000
I'm just surprised Elliot's here with a nobody.

83
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.800
Well, maybe it's because Elliot chose me.

84
00:04:53.519 --> 00:04:55.199
A nobody instead of you.

85
00:04:57.329 --> 00:04:59.439
Courtney, look at your shit.

86
00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.079
Well, when is it in your business?

87
00:05:07.899 --> 00:05:08.699
Why are we here?

88
00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:11.420
It's a fashion exhibition.

89
00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:12.860
I thought you might like it.

90
00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:13.899
Keep an eye on her.

91
00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.699
Find out what she's doing with Elliot.

92
00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:21.660
Works, the design, everything, it's perfect.

93
00:05:23.149 --> 00:05:24.350
You know how long I might like this one?

94
00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:25.680
Your mom?

95
00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:27.920
That's the birthday next week.

96
00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.360
Figured I might buy her nice dress.

97
00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:31.259
Well, it is beautiful.

98
00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.279
Excuse me, sir.

99
00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:34.860
I think I'll take this one.

100
00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:37.410
If you get wrapped up too, they'll be nice.

101
00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:40.259
Wait, I think there's something wrong with this dress.

102
00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:46.879
Do not buy that dress.

103
00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:50.620
It's really telling Elliot this night or what to do.

104
00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.339
Some people can't tell art when it's right in front of their face.

105
00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.220
Sorry, are you surveying that piece?

106
00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:58.459
I guess not.

107
00:05:58.779 --> 00:05:59.339
Don't worry.

108
00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:01.259
I'll buy it for you, Elliot.

109
00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:03.250
Anything for you?

110
00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:09.490
You okay?

111
00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:09.810
Yeah.

112
00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:12.399
Just that dress is a counterfeit.

113
00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.879
Someone tried to replicate it and sell it.

114
00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:18.420
All right, well, what about this one?

115
00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:21.329
It says it's a Victorian dress.

116
00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:23.649
It's clearly Edwardian.

117
00:06:23.649 --> 00:06:26.129
The sleeves are loose, not fitted.

118
00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:27.889
The fabric is slight and simple.

119
00:06:28.689 --> 00:06:32.000
No woman in the Victorian era would wear.

120
00:06:32.079 --> 00:06:34.240
Wow, you are a woman of many surprises.

121
00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:38.689
How many more hidden talents I should know about?

122
00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:44.019
Maybe you'll have to find out for yourself.

123
00:06:44.019 --> 00:06:54.850
Hey, are you okay?

124
00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:58.269
Are you okay? Do you want to take you to the hospital?

125
00:07:01.339 --> 00:07:02.459
What's your problem, Courtney?

126
00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:06.420
Is she just rewriting to me?

127
00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:07.779
She must have cut your shit.

128
00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:09.709
I saw what you did.

129
00:07:09.709 --> 00:07:12.589
And from here on, you're done with Sutter Enterprise.

130
00:07:12.589 --> 00:07:14.610
Never cast you again.

131
00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:15.490
I could promise you that.

132
00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:28.110
You're lost.

133
00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:36.779
You still need to find a present for your mom's birthday.

134
00:07:37.339 --> 00:07:37.819
Don't worry.

135
00:07:37.819 --> 00:07:38.529
I'll close.

136
00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:41.579
I'll take you there tomorrow.

137
00:07:41.579 --> 00:07:51.310
Morning, Mr. Snyder.

138
00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:52.350
What are you, Frank?

139
00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:53.310
Looking for a new suit?

140
00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:56.699
Actually, my wife has some ideas for dress.

141
00:07:56.699 --> 00:07:57.500
That's okay.

142
00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:58.060
Why, of course.

143
00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:00.379
Whatever you'd like to try, Mrs. Snyder.

144
00:08:00.379 --> 00:08:06.050
Wow, this is amazing.

145
00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:09.810
And Frank and I go way back, so feel free to use whatever you want.

146
00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:14.399
I'm sure whatever you do make, my mom's gonna love us.

147
00:08:14.399 --> 00:08:15.199
Don't worry about that.

148
00:08:18.079 --> 00:08:18.800
I will have fun.

149
00:08:19.819 --> 00:08:21.259
Frank and I will be in the back of the news.

150
00:08:21.819 --> 00:08:53.500
What are you doing here?

151
00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:54.220
You need to go.

152
00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:55.740
No one wants to work with me.

153
00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:57.419
My career is over.

154
00:08:57.659 --> 00:08:59.019
Oh, is that my fault?

155
00:08:59.019 --> 00:09:01.139
I'm sorry.

156
00:09:01.139 --> 00:09:02.419
Okay, but please.

157
00:09:04.899 --> 00:09:06.019
For whatever reason he lives.

158
00:09:06.019 --> 00:09:07.299
The hell's going on here.

159
00:09:07.299 --> 00:09:08.259
Are you all right?

160
00:09:08.259 --> 00:09:08.899
I'm fine.

161
00:09:08.899 --> 00:09:10.419
She just shook me a little.

162
00:09:11.059 --> 00:09:12.419
What the hell is your problem?

163
00:09:12.419 --> 00:09:13.700
I'm gonna call the cops on you.

164
00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:15.570
I was apologizing, actually.

165
00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:16.210
Okay.

166
00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:17.970
Look, Elliot, I'm so sorry.

167
00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:19.889
And this isn't how we're supposed to be.

168
00:09:19.889 --> 00:09:21.330
Yeah, well, this is all your fault.

169
00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:22.289
I have to see your ass again.

170
00:09:22.289 --> 00:09:23.409
I'm gonna take you to jail.

171
00:09:23.409 --> 00:09:24.690
Came to get her out of here.

172
00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:25.730
No, that's...

173
00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:29.120
No, wait, wait.

174
00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:29.679
Are you all right?

175
00:09:29.679 --> 00:09:30.399
I'm so sorry.

176
00:09:35.279 --> 00:09:38.929
Forgive me, Miss, but did you make this?

177
00:09:40.259 --> 00:09:41.700
Yeah.

178
00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:42.820
This is just remarkable.

179
00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:43.220
I...

180
00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:45.139
You sure have some serious talent.

181
00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:50.110
This Mr. Snyder is a replica of the dress

182
00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:52.110
that Miss Catherine Hepburn wore

183
00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:53.789
in her movie, The Philadelphia Story.

184
00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:57.490
All my life, I never thought I would see

185
00:09:57.490 --> 00:09:59.970
another dress with that level of artistry.

186
00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:02.049
But here it is, right in front of me.

187
00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:06.340
Mrs. Snyder, your talent is next level.

188
00:10:07.519 --> 00:10:08.559
What do you think?

189
00:10:08.639 --> 00:10:10.080
I guess I took you to the right place.

190
00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:13.919
You are full of surprises.

191
00:10:13.919 --> 00:10:15.279
I mean, how do you even do all that?

192
00:10:16.289 --> 00:10:17.570
The girl needs a hobby, right?

193
00:10:18.559 --> 00:10:20.799
At least now we have a gift for your mom's birthday.

194
00:10:20.799 --> 00:10:23.100
I really hope she likes it.

195
00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:23.980
But she's gonna love it.

196
00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:26.059
Especially knowing you've been in this garage.

197
00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:55.730
Mom, go to your room member.

198
00:11:00.769 --> 00:11:01.169
Stop it.

199
00:11:01.809 --> 00:11:03.169
I'm calling the cops.

200
00:11:03.169 --> 00:11:05.090
Are you Sarah's mother or grandmother?

201
00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:06.769
You look like a hundred.

202
00:11:06.769 --> 00:11:07.970
Oh, fucking dare you.

203
00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:10.850
Tell that bitch to keep her dirty hands off of Elliot Snyder.

204
00:11:16.669 --> 00:11:18.960
Mom, are you okay?

205
00:11:19.519 --> 00:11:22.320
Your sister is tearing this family apart.

206
00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:23.679
We've got to make her pay.

207
00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:27.700
Mom, I don't know those girls.

208
00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:31.220
And besides, why would I send someone to trash the house?

209
00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:33.460
I don't know who posted those rumors about me.

210
00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:34.259
They weren't true.

211
00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:39.629
Is this all my fault?

212
00:11:40.799 --> 00:11:43.440
Did I put my mom and my sister in danger?

213
00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:44.399
It's not your fault.

214
00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:46.480
I'm gonna get down to the bottom of this

215
00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:48.879
and figure out how to spread those fake rooms on my trusty, okay?

216
00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:51.500
You just stay here and rest.

217
00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:54.129
I'm gonna take care of this.

218
00:11:54.129 --> 00:12:03.549
What was that boss?

219
00:12:04.559 --> 00:12:07.279
Find out who spread those fake rumors about Sarah online.

220
00:12:07.279 --> 00:12:08.740
You got it boss.

221
00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:18.610
Jamie, you found anything?

222
00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:21.090
We aren't a hundred percent sure yet,

223
00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:23.889
but the articles might have come from someone on Courtney Clark's team.

224
00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:27.299
Courtney, I knew she was her.

225
00:12:27.299 --> 00:12:28.820
I knew she was involved and I warned her.

226
00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:30.259
I warned her to leave Sarah alone.

227
00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:31.299
We don't know.

228
00:12:31.299 --> 00:12:32.419
I want to organize a party.

229
00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:35.809
And I want you to call all the executives we know and invite them.

230
00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:36.850
A party?

231
00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:37.730
Yes, a party.

232
00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:41.299
I want to make sure Courtney Clark has an invitation.

233
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:46.480
Helliot.

234
00:12:47.519 --> 00:12:48.080
Helliot.

235
00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:49.440
Oh, Mr. Monroe.

236
00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:50.960
It's so good to see you out in public.

237
00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:52.320
So if you see two of this,

238
00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:53.600
you must be rude.

239
00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:54.399
My lovely wife.

240
00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:57.279
Hopefully she'll make it longer the last one.

241
00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:00.480
Listen, have you seen Courtney Clark by chances?

242
00:13:06.529 --> 00:13:09.740
Courtney, it's so good to see you.

243
00:13:10.539 --> 00:13:14.139
Listen, I was really hoping to speak in private.

244
00:13:14.139 --> 00:13:15.019
That's okay.

245
00:13:15.019 --> 00:13:17.500
Just, just me and you.

246
00:13:18.429 --> 00:13:18.990
Of course.

247
00:13:19.789 --> 00:13:21.549
Of course, anything for you, Helliot.

248
00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:23.470
I can't believe it.

249
00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:24.750
The plan is working.

250
00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:42.100
Did you start those rumors about Sarah?

251
00:13:44.299 --> 00:13:44.860
So what?

252
00:13:46.269 --> 00:13:47.950
I'm only doing you a favor.

253
00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:48.269
Really?

254
00:13:49.309 --> 00:13:49.950
How so?

255
00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:50.509
Come on.

256
00:13:50.509 --> 00:13:53.629
We both know she's not the woman for you, Helliot.

257
00:13:53.629 --> 00:13:54.750
Look how she grew up.

258
00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:55.629
Look at her family.

259
00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:59.820
You are way out of her league and she knows it too.

260
00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:02.779
That's why I started all those rumors.

261
00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:04.909
You need to get rid of her.

262
00:14:05.549 --> 00:14:07.230
I should only drag you down.

263
00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:10.110
You're so right.

264
00:14:10.909 --> 00:14:12.190
She's nothing like me.

265
00:14:13.059 --> 00:14:13.539
Thank you.

266
00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:16.529
Do you want to be a drink to her with me?

267
00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:17.809
Of course.

268
00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:18.929
Yeah.

269
00:14:19.889 --> 00:14:20.850
Don't keep me waiting.

270
00:14:31.149 --> 00:14:32.509
You want Jamie to take you home?

271
00:14:32.509 --> 00:14:32.669
No.

272
00:14:33.389 --> 00:14:38.620
This is what were you and Courtney talking about?

273
00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:41.379
Oh, nothing you have to worry about.

274
00:14:48.379 --> 00:14:48.860
Courtney.

275
00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:50.220
Hey.

276
00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:51.500
Hi, you found the best butt.

277
00:14:53.679 --> 00:14:54.879
Oh, you look so gorgeous.

278
00:14:56.019 --> 00:14:57.460
You haven't seen anything yet.

279
00:14:57.460 --> 00:14:58.340
Oh, really?

280
00:14:58.340 --> 00:14:59.700
I just hope you're ready when you do.

281
00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:07.500
What's he doing?

282
00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:09.500
Oh, just starting the show.

283
00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:12.659
Come on.

284
00:15:12.659 --> 00:15:15.700
We both know she's not the woman for you, Helliot.

285
00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:16.820
Look how she grew up.

286
00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:17.940
Look at her family.

287
00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:21.139
You are way out of her league and she knows it too.

288
00:15:22.899 --> 00:15:23.620
Helliot, I...

289
00:15:24.639 --> 00:15:25.440
Nope.

290
00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:26.159
No.

291
00:15:26.159 --> 00:15:26.879
There's more.

292
00:15:26.879 --> 00:15:28.299
Trust me.

293
00:15:28.299 --> 00:15:30.299
That's why I started all those rumors.

294
00:15:31.169 --> 00:15:32.610
You need to get rid of her.

295
00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:34.129
I'll never leave Sarah.

296
00:15:34.129 --> 00:15:35.330
And I'll always protect her.

297
00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:39.419
So don't you dare try to do a little trick like that again.

298
00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:41.500
Get out of here.

299
00:15:57.549 --> 00:16:00.350
Hey, what you doing?

300
00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:01.149
Looking for a job.

301
00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:04.480
You don't need a job, you're my wife.

302
00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:06.779
But I want to work.

303
00:16:06.779 --> 00:16:08.700
Besides, I think it'll be good for me.

304
00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:11.340
So I can actually go do something instead of lying here all day.

305
00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:12.740
Can work for me.

306
00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:15.629
I need a secretary in that way.

307
00:16:15.629 --> 00:16:20.340
I can keep an eye on you.

308
00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:20.980
I can do that.

309
00:16:21.649 --> 00:16:22.690
When do I start tomorrow?

310
00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:23.649
Oh, hold on.

311
00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:25.169
We haven't even done a formal interview yet.

312
00:16:25.169 --> 00:16:26.210
How do I know you're qualified?

313
00:16:26.769 --> 00:16:34.340
You're ours.

314
00:16:40.129 --> 00:16:40.769
Yup.

315
00:16:40.769 --> 00:16:42.210
I'll show you to your office.

316
00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:44.129
What did I say about no special treatment?

317
00:16:44.929 --> 00:16:45.169
Right.

318
00:16:46.159 --> 00:16:57.950
I'll see you at lunch then.

319
00:16:57.950 --> 00:16:58.909
Morning.

320
00:16:58.909 --> 00:17:00.509
I'm the new boss's secretary.

321
00:17:04.799 --> 00:17:06.480
Someone showed me to my desk.

322
00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:06.799
Please.

323
00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:11.740
I'm sorry.

324
00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:13.660
They told me it was on this floor.

325
00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:15.180
And how should I know?

326
00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:16.619
If you can't even find your workstation,

327
00:17:16.619 --> 00:17:17.980
maybe this job isn't for you.

328
00:17:18.859 --> 00:17:19.660
Um...

329
00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:20.859
You look lost little girl.

330
00:17:20.859 --> 00:17:22.140
You should go home.

331
00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:23.660
I'm the new secretary.

332
00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:24.460
Please.

333
00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:26.619
I bet Mr. Snyder will fire you in no time.

334
00:17:26.619 --> 00:17:28.700
And you don't have to worry about clearing out your desk.

335
00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:29.819
Because you can't even find it.

336
00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:34.079
I think you're the one that's getting fired.

337
00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:38.670
Do you all even know who this is?

338
00:17:39.309 --> 00:17:40.670
How dare you?

339
00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:41.789
I'm so sorry about this.

340
00:17:41.789 --> 00:17:43.789
They don't represent the views of this company.

341
00:17:43.789 --> 00:17:44.269
That's fine.

342
00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:45.740
It's no big deal.

343
00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:47.900
You're both over in apology, right?

344
00:17:49.019 --> 00:17:50.619
I'm so sorry, Sarah.

345
00:17:50.619 --> 00:17:51.740
Yeah, really sorry.

346
00:17:52.299 --> 00:17:53.740
I can show you to your desk right now

347
00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:54.940
and then give you a tour of the company.

348
00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:56.140
Don't even bother.

349
00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:57.019
You two are fired.

350
00:17:57.740 --> 00:17:58.859
Clear out your desk by today.

351
00:18:00.099 --> 00:18:01.059
Please follow me, Sarah.

352
00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:06.509
Mr. Snyder's in a meeting,

353
00:18:06.509 --> 00:18:07.869
but he told me that you can wait here.

354
00:18:25.519 --> 00:18:26.160
Wait here, wait here.

355
00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:29.440
Right.

356
00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:32.450
Um, all yours.

357
00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:33.009
What do you need?

358
00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:36.849
Since you're us, don't I?

359
00:18:36.849 --> 00:18:39.920
On it.

360
00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:40.640
Mr. Snyder.

361
00:18:41.519 --> 00:18:44.480
We've reached a decision to invest in this movie production team.

362
00:18:45.279 --> 00:18:47.759
They're making a historical fiction movie

363
00:18:47.759 --> 00:18:49.759
and we think it's going to be the next blockbuster.

364
00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:54.240
It's estimated that the revenue will be four times the investment.

365
00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:55.759
The figures do look good.

366
00:18:55.759 --> 00:18:56.319
Good job.

367
00:18:57.869 --> 00:18:58.430
Don't do it.

368
00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:01.500
Sorry, what did you say to them?

369
00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:04.940
Sorry, what did you say to them?

370
00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:12.210
It says it's a movie about World War I.

371
00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:15.859
But all the women are wearing close hats

372
00:19:15.859 --> 00:19:18.579
and the headlines are up to the ankles.

373
00:19:18.579 --> 00:19:20.579
Those didn't become a thing until the 1920s.

374
00:19:20.579 --> 00:19:21.700
What are you talking about?

375
00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:24.180
Chris continues to know.

376
00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:31.140
And the men, aside from the ones wearing uniforms,

377
00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:34.339
they're all clearly wearing stuff inspired by the 1920s.

378
00:19:34.339 --> 00:19:36.900
It's going to be hard to make a good movie

379
00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:38.339
with all the details wrong.

380
00:19:39.789 --> 00:19:41.150
Right, Mr. Snyder?

381
00:19:42.029 --> 00:19:44.190
So you're telling me that you, a secretary,

382
00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:46.750
knows more about movie investing than our investment team?

383
00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:46.990
I don't know.

384
00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:51.009
Start over.

385
00:19:53.329 --> 00:19:55.819
And I want you to apologize.

386
00:19:59.309 --> 00:20:01.470
I'm sorry, that was a root of me.

387
00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:07.170
What would I do without you?

388
00:20:07.789 --> 00:20:10.029
I'm glad the boss is happy with my performance.

389
00:20:10.589 --> 00:20:13.730
Well, the boss is very happy.

390
00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:17.309
Well, maybe he'll be even happier tonight.

391
00:20:19.119 --> 00:20:20.160
Maybe, England.
