1
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:06,530
Sarah, oh my God, are you okay?

2
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:09,710
Are you okay?

3
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:11,710
Is the baby okay?

4
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:12,710
The baby's fine.

5
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:15,939
But I'd advise you to rest here for a few days.

6
00:00:15,939 --> 00:00:21,629
Any stress, physical or emotional could affect the baby.

7
00:00:21,629 --> 00:00:23,079
Doctor's right.

8
00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:24,079
You need to rest.

9
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:32,829
Get out of my house.

10
00:00:32,829 --> 00:00:33,829
It's okay.

11
00:00:33,829 --> 00:00:34,829
You're not in trouble.

12
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:39,649
You're gonna talk to your mom.

13
00:00:39,649 --> 00:00:42,649
Because of you, Sarah's in the hospital.

14
00:00:42,649 --> 00:00:44,649
It was an accident she fell.

15
00:00:44,649 --> 00:00:45,840
Shut it.

16
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,219
You've been abusing it for years, haven't you?

17
00:00:48,219 --> 00:00:50,219
But it's up to me you being the emergency room.

18
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:51,219
Trust me.

19
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:58,789
The fake IDs.

20
00:00:58,789 --> 00:01:00,789
I wish you to disappear.

21
00:01:00,789 --> 00:01:01,789
Make sure your son is the best lawyer

22
00:01:01,789 --> 00:01:03,789
and to make your neighbor's college tuition is paid for.

23
00:01:03,789 --> 00:01:06,459
And if I see your face again,

24
00:01:06,459 --> 00:01:11,540
I'll make sure the next time Sarah sees you's in the morgue.
