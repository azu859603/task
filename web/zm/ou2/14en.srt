00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:05,139
It's okay, I'm not going anywhere, all right?

2
00:00:05,139 --> 00:00:07,599
You promise?

3
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:08,599
No promise.

4
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:18,829
Marissa, I'll be right here.

5
00:00:18,829 --> 00:00:19,829
Hello?

6
00:00:19,829 --> 00:00:21,829
How's my lovely son?

7
00:00:21,829 --> 00:00:23,829
Did you finally meet a girl?

8
00:00:23,829 --> 00:00:24,829
When do I get to meet her?

9
00:00:24,829 --> 00:00:27,829
My mom, yes, I'm gonna bring you your birthday next week, okay?

10
00:00:27,829 --> 00:00:29,829
So you did meet a girl?

11
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:31,059
When?

12
00:00:31,059 --> 00:00:33,060
Were you playing to ever tell me?

13
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:34,060
I gotta go, mom. I gotta go.

14
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:35,060
Wait!

15
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:36,060
Thanks!

16
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:37,060
How did you meet her?
