00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
Come on, show us.

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.830
Actually, I did bring her something.

3
00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.330
Just one second.

4
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.769
Sarah, how do you didn't have to do that?

5
00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:11.769
Mom.

6
00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:13.070
What's that, honey?

7
00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:14.169
Why is she here?

8
00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:15.669
Do you mean Courtney?

9
00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:17.670
Our families are close friends.

10
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.070
I thought you guys were both very close.

11
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.070
You were.

12
00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.829
Mm.

13
00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:25.329
She made this herself.

14
00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:29.760
What?

15
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:30.760
Oh, gosh.

16
00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:31.760
No.

17
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.719
No, no, no.

18
00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:34.719
That's right.

19
00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.640
This was ripped by a hand.

20
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.640
Who did this?

21
00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.640
What are you talking about?

22
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.640
You're the one that brought it?

23
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.640
Is this some joke you actually expect our mother to wear?

24
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:46.640
That's-

25
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:47.640
Shut up, Sam.

26
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.840
She didn't do this while my son made myself.

27
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:51.840
Please.

28
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.840
She couldn't actually make a dress like that.

29
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.840
We know you like her, but this is ridiculous.

30
00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:58.840
Alright.

31
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.929
I'll just have to make it again.

32
00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:01.929
In front of your-
