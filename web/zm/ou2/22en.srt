1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:08,519
How'd you do it?

2
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:10,289
What?

3
00:00:10,289 --> 00:00:11,289
Your shop.

4
00:00:11,289 --> 00:00:14,480
You just opened a week ago and you're already profiting three times the cost.

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,480
Well, I hate to use the word prodigy, but...

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,480
sometimes...

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,480
Alright, well this calls for a solid brush. Got it? You have to do it?

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:29,850
Sarah?

9
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:31,359
Frank?

10
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:32,840
Oh my God!

11
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,840
What? You got out?

12
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,840
Of course!

13
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,840
They'll never get me.

14
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,840
Oh, this is my wife, Olivia. Olivia, my baby sister.

15
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,929
Well, who should you go then? Get a reservation.

16
00:00:44,929 --> 00:00:46,929
Right, um, I'll see you.

17
00:00:46,929 --> 00:00:49,920
Do you know who that man is?

18
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,920
That's Eliot Snyder. He's one of the richest men in the country.

19
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,689
It can be.

20
00:00:56,689 --> 00:00:59,689
You idiot! That's totally him. I'm positive.

21
00:00:59,689 --> 00:01:02,689
And he's with your sister. We're gonna be rich.

22
00:01:02,689 --> 00:01:04,849
Think about it.

23
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:06,200
Drink?

24
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,620
Sure?
