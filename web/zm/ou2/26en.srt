00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:08,439
Wow. I've known this is what you do. I would have come see you sooner.

2
00:00:08,439 --> 00:00:11,789
I see it's a little tight in the shoulders.

3
00:00:11,789 --> 00:00:16,850
Yeah, this is just a little something to do, so I don't go crazy.

4
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:22,859
Out of my way. Oh, Sarah, there you are.

5
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:28,179
What do you want? What the fuck do you mean, what do I want? I want my money.

6
00:00:28,179 --> 00:00:32,179
We've talked about this. I don't have any control over Elliot's money.

7
00:00:32,179 --> 00:00:36,179
Figure it out. You won't reject your brother, right?

8
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:40,179
I'm the only family you have left. Something funny to you?

9
00:00:40,179 --> 00:00:46,079
Yeah. I think you should fucking leave. Not this time.

10
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:58,899
Write me a check for 500 grand, where I'll burn this entire place to the ground.
