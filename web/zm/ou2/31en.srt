1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,220
Hey, you're not still mad at me, are you?

2
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,820
After you beat up my friend in public?

3
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:11,820
Yeah.

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,820
Hey, well, I thought he was gonna take you away from me.

5
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,820
I could have been killed if it wasn't for Bruce.

6
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,820
He saved me from three bad guys all by himself.

7
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,820
That's what I'm very thankful for.

8
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,820
Yeah, we sure showed him how thankful you were.

9
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:22,820
Hey, come on.

10
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:23,820
Don't.

11
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:24,890
Give me a loan.

12
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:25,890
I'm tired.

13
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:28,210
Sir, I'm your husband.

14
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:30,399
I just don't want him to steal you away from you.

15
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:31,399
That's it.

16
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:48,340
The girl is safe.

17
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,340
Her husband just took her home.

18
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:51,340
Good.

19
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:54,329
You sure this is the right girl, sir?

20
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:56,329
You think you can do a DNA test?

21
00:00:56,329 --> 00:00:57,329
There's no need for that.

22
00:00:57,329 --> 00:00:59,899
I can recognize my own daughter.

23
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:02,289
She looks just like her mother.
