1
00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.360
They're still together

2
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:13.189
Here, I thought mr. Snider had moved on from that one. Hi, Sarah. Hi

3
00:00:13.689 --> 00:00:21.410
How are you my face isn't swollen anymore, so that's good. I should apologize to you. She doesn't think I'm a bully, huh?

4
00:00:21.969 --> 00:00:32.289
Hey, can I talk to you man? Sure. I'm going to the ladies room. Look. I just wanted to apologize

5
00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:37.740
You didn't deserve a punch in the face. Well, I think I just get a little protective Sarah

6
00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:40.100
That's not an excuse

7
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:58.689
So sorry. Hey, man. How are you? Look you've got nothing to worry about. I view Sarah like a little sister. It's just you and me now

8
00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:02.420
Courtney

9
00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.859
Come down

10
00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:15.760
Relax

11
00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.599
Where Sarah she's been in the ladies room for about 15 minutes now, sir

12
00:01:19.599 --> 00:01:22.239
We're not sure where the we should go in or not. No

13
00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:38.859
Something's definitely wrong. I'm going in want me to leave Elliot so you can have him. Is that it?

14
00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:41.700
Yeah

15
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.019
So you either walk away or I make you disappear. That's never

16
00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:52.079
No one's gonna save you now, honey

17
00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:58.459
Sarah you better pray to God that my Sarah was okay

18
00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
Let me go out of the way

19
00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:13.719
Sure, Ken

20
00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:15.719
Thank you for you did it. I seriously

21
00:02:16.139 --> 00:02:24.330
Young man, you better take care of her if you expect to keep her. I'm sorry. Are you giving me orders?

22
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.099
She's my wife

23
00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:30.740
I expect to keep her my wife for the rest of my life. Thank you very much

24
00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:45.110
Don't worry, sir. Both the patient and the baby are gonna be fine. You got her pregnant

25
00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.780
You monster

26
00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.900
Again, not sure what her pregnancy has anything to do with you

27
00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:55.900
So if you excuse me to see my wife

28
00:02:56.419 --> 00:03:05.710
This is all my fault

29
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:13.069
She's been there to protect her. Hey, man. You're doing everything you can. Don't be so hard on yourself

30
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:15.810
Why don't you stay here with her?

31
00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.210
I'm gonna go pay Ms. Courtney Clark a business

32
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:38.009
Find out what you can about Thomas Morgan and his relationship with Sarah

33
00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:58.319
Please be okay, sir. Please be okay. In the hospital. Be okay

34
00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:05.659
Hey, hey, don't worry the baby's okay doctor said you need rest

35
00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:16.029
This is all my fault. I should have been there to protect you. I should have been a better hospital

36
00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:36.430
Ever since I met you I've just never been won't I get you out of here?

37
00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.740
What the biggest most amazing wedding ever, okay?

38
00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:43.850
Really?

39
00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:47.579
With all of you guys. Why don't you rest up?

40
00:04:47.980 --> 00:05:01.889
Look at you some water, okay?

41
00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:15.540
Jamie, what's happening? What are you sure? He's her father afraid so boss and the Morgan's have made a fortune running firearms and drugs

42
00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.540
along the East Coast in the 80s and have made some generational wealth and how

43
00:05:20.019 --> 00:05:25.019
What does that mean for her? How does that how does that affect Sarah since you haven't officially announced your marriage yet?

44
00:05:25.019 --> 00:05:29.379
That means other people from other powerful families might come after her

45
00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:40.240
Don't worry. What she recovers will have a wedding and everyone already got it. That is Mr. So much

46
00:05:49.819 --> 00:05:51.160
Mr. Snyder

47
00:05:51.160 --> 00:06:02.810
It's Thomas Morgan. I think it's about time. We officially met. I had to go home to work baby, but I'll take you back

48
00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:05.529
Okay, it's okay. You go ahead. See you later

49
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:18.370
You really think I'd bring a gun to meet my father-in-law?

50
00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:23.160
Never be too careful. Come on. Let's sit

51
00:06:24.899 --> 00:06:27.220
Can I have for you drink

52
00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:33.730
So what's this all about Mr. Morgan?

53
00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:36.810
Sarah's mother and I were

54
00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:39.540
Constantly on the run

55
00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:42.389
either to new opportunities

56
00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:48.810
Or away from the police

57
00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:50.610
When Sarah was born

58
00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:55.259
We didn't know how to raise her. We took her to an orphanage and

59
00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:59.490
Her mother died shortly after that

60
00:07:00.209 --> 00:07:07.259
Now I know a parent should never be separated from their child. So you can imagine how I felt when I found her

61
00:07:07.259 --> 00:07:11.300
I even sent my man Bruce to keep an eye on her

62
00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:18.629
Bruce is your man. You sure are absent a lot Elliot and you keep allowing Sarah to get into danger

63
00:07:18.629 --> 00:07:23.949
That's not true at all. You know it's not true. The last time I saw was in an emergency room

64
00:07:23.949 --> 00:07:28.430
How do you explain that? Sarah struggled in life because she had no family to rely on

65
00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:34.750
She does now. It's time that you leave her so I can find her a real man to be your husband. Get out

66
00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:37.470
Come on Elliot

67
00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:48.100
Pick up. Come on. Come on. Come on. Pick up. Get out. Get your fucking hands off me

68
00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:52.660
I'm never gonna leave Sarah

69
00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:57.500
Especially know the deadbeat dad that left him a dust. How dare you?

70
00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:01.259
You have no idea the shit I've been through. I don't care

71
00:08:02.009 --> 00:08:05.129
Doesn't even excuse me a bad dad. Oh, we're done here

72
00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:07.980
Don't let me see you run Sarah again

73
00:08:12.339 --> 00:08:15.019
Courtney

74
00:08:15.019 --> 00:08:38.899
Hello, you busted my knee. How about I return the favor? That's right

75
00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:42.379
What do we do with her?

76
00:08:42.379 --> 00:08:44.980
You're in front want money, right?

77
00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:47.019
Put out a ransom

78
00:08:47.019 --> 00:08:49.899
Make Elliot pay. Once you guys get your money

79
00:08:50.539 --> 00:08:57.019
Give her a slow and painful death. What about him? I don't care. I'm on him. I'm on this one

80
00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:59.580
Dubbed the body usher

81
00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:07.649
No, come to make a cup. Pick up. Pick up

82
00:09:16.059 --> 00:09:19.179
Jamie take a detour to the bank. Which bank boss? Any bank

83
00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:23.039
I'm gonna be Sarah home. I'm gonna kill her and get this

84
00:09:23.679 --> 00:09:34.350
Your career knows no end. Does it?

85
00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:42.340
There it is. Oh

86
00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:48.740
He's not a part of this. Let him go. You're a no-place to paint a ghost you're eating Elliot

87
00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:51.100
Besides I don't give a damn about your money

88
00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:54.539
Honey, honey, wait up

89
00:09:54.659 --> 00:10:06.720
I'm not leaving without her. That's just too damn bad. You ain't got a choice

90
00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:11.539
It's $10 million. I'm gonna be rich. Oh, yeah

91
00:10:12.139 --> 00:10:15.500
Wait, don't you mean we? I'm sorry honey. Oh

92
00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:25.409
Crap

93
00:10:25.409 --> 00:10:37.080
Have you ever loved before Courtney? I'm feeling you'd be willing to die for what the hell are you talking about?

94
00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:39.840
You've never loved today in your life. Have you?

95
00:10:43.779 --> 00:10:47.019
Hey, hey, and you okay?

96
00:10:47.299 --> 00:11:03.779
Don't you see if I've ever loved any man. It's you and if I can't have you

97
00:11:03.779 --> 00:11:07.159
I'm sure as hell are gonna be the one to end you

98
00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:15.039
That way you're always mine. You did always have a soft spot

99
00:11:15.519 --> 00:11:21.789
But it also made you weak. Is this just you mean?

100
00:11:25.230 --> 00:12:01.659
Love is in the weakness Courtney. Are you okay? Please I was wrong about Elliot

101
00:12:02.139 --> 00:12:06.120
They're perfect together

102
00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:13.389
They look so beautiful. You're not so bad yourself mr. Snyder. You're waiting for this moment in my whole life

103
00:12:15.389 --> 00:12:20.279
Me too as long as you both shall live I do
