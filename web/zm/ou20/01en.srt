1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:08,539
This is going to be the heat of my year.

2
00:00:08,539 --> 00:00:11,539
I can't believe we're going to make that look.

3
00:00:11,539 --> 00:00:13,539
Edward's today.

4
00:00:13,539 --> 00:00:18,539
Yes, Mr. Edward's our alternate investor in President of the War and Grinch.

5
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:21,539
Although, no one here has met him yet.

6
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:23,539
I heard he's super cute.

7
00:00:23,539 --> 00:00:29,429
I can't wait to meet him and wish him a merry Christmas.

8
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:31,039
Alright everyone.

9
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,039
Mr. Edward should be here soon.

10
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:35,039
I want you all to look your best.

11
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:47,469
Oh my gosh.

12
00:00:47,469 --> 00:00:49,469
Young, rich, and handsome.

13
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:51,729
You got me.

14
00:00:51,729 --> 00:00:53,530
Perfect.

15
00:00:53,530 --> 00:01:03,390
Thank you very much.

16
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,390
It's very good to see everybody, but I have a question for you.

17
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:07,390
It is Christmas.

18
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:08,390
What are you still doing here?

19
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:10,390
Merry Christmas, Mr. Edward.

20
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:14,390
We are so honored to have you back in Ravenham.

21
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:18,900
And I wanted to invite you to our welcome dinner.

22
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:19,900
Well, you know that.

23
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:20,900
It's very kind of easy.

24
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:24,900
I actually just had a meeting with the governor and I am running late to meet my wife.

25
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:25,900
So I will see you guys all later.

26
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:26,900
Thank you very much.

27
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:27,900
I like getting mine.

28
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:33,900
I totally understand, but before you go, will you please accept these gifts we put together for you.

29
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:34,900
Yes.

30
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:41,900
There's a diamond broach, vintage bottle from the halls vineyard, an exquisite porcelain pieces.

31
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:47,900
You know, I did not get a Christmas gift from my wife this year, which means I could probably be in trouble.

32
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:48,900
So, thank you very much.

33
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:49,900
This is perfect.

34
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:50,900
It's my machine.

35
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:51,900
Hey.

36
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,579
You know what?

37
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:55,579
My wife worked at the automobile bank.

38
00:01:55,579 --> 00:01:58,930
I'm going to send you her information.

39
00:01:58,930 --> 00:01:59,930
Can you please take care of me?

40
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:00,930
Yes, sir.

41
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:01,930
Of course.

42
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:03,280
Bye everybody.

43
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,280
I'll see you later.

44
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,280
Hey.

45
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,280
His wife is Caroline Baker.

46
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,280
I can't believe it.

47
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,590
He's a Christmas.

48
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,590
Draven doesn't really like mine.

49
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,590
I'll take this one.

50
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:31,469
Yeah.

51
00:02:31,469 --> 00:02:34,889
Um, we're, we're put together slow.

52
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:39,870
I thought it coming through my Christmas.

53
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:48,069
Who's this?

54
00:02:48,069 --> 00:02:49,069
Hurry up too.

55
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:50,069
You can finally get a divorce in Caroline.
