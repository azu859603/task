It's my best friend. I'll introduce you guys later. She's shining star at the outfit

2
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.039
I'm excited to watch it.

3
00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:10.199
All right.

4
00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:16.870
He's that charming, huh?

5
00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:23.870
He's totally my type. Oh, by the way, Caroline, please help me take out his sister's dress.

6
00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:27.910
I must capture our young hot president's eyes at the welcome dinner tonight.

7
00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:38.170
You got it, girl.

8
00:00:38.170 --> 00:01:00.679
Hey, Caroline. Your mom lost husband and finally made it back.

9
00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:03.679
Heidi, you know, Philip was just working out of time.

10
00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:10.680
Oh, good for him. I was afraid we'd see him on the news for Robin the Bank or get him

11
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.680
arrested.

12
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.680
Heidi, thank you very much for your concern.

13
00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.810
All right. All right. Heidi is just messing around.

14
00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.870
Philip, you have any gifts for us?

15
00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.870
Yes. Nick, go ahead and pick whichever line of life.

16
00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:38.810
Looks like plastic broaches, some wine from a fake vineyard and cheap ceramics that won't

17
00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.810
even sell for 10 bucks.

18
00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.810
Caroline here, are you sure your man isn't going to trick on us?
