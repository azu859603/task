00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Hey, what the hell's your problem?

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.320
Oh, you think we're too stupid to realize how precious your little gifts are?

3
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:10.320
I know you were broke, but I didn't realize how big of a loser you were.

4
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.320
Yeah, I'm actually not broke.

5
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.509
Fuck it.

6
00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:16.510
Can you guys just please give him a break?

7
00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.510
I feel it's just been through a really tough time, and...

8
00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.579
Why does it matter how much these gifts are worth?

9
00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:24.579
It's about family and being together.

10
00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:29.579
Oh, Caroline, you're hopeless.

11
00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:30.579
Mm-hmm.

12
00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:34.390
Mom.

13
00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.929
Oh, Mike, sweetie, what's wrong?

14
00:00:37.929 --> 00:00:40.929
Mom, my favorite Thunderblade 9X.

15
00:00:40.929 --> 00:00:42.929
My toy car is broken.

16
00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:44.929
Oh, I'm sorry, sweetie.

17
00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:45.929
Um...

18
00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:47.929
We'll get you a new one.

19
00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:50.929
But I only want this one.

20
00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:53.929
Oh, I know, but they don't make that one anymore.

21
00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:55.929
It's really hard for us to find the same kind.

22
00:00:55.929 --> 00:00:58.929
I want my Thunderblade 9X back.

23
00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:01.929
Nick, can we find another way?

24
00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:04.930
You can't get the toy car without the purchase real.

25
00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:05.930
Okay?

26
00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:06.930
There's nothing I can do.

27
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.930
Andrew's father is the deputy director at the plant.

28
00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.930
Caroline, can you talk to him?

29
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.930
Maybe he can get Mike another Thunderblade 9X?

30
00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.930
Oh, that's a great idea, Doris.

31
00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.930
Caroline, please, can you help us out?

32
00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.930
No, no, that guy has a lot of malicious intentions towards Caroline.

33
00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.930
I think as her husband, I don't really want my wife to be around a guy like that.

34
00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:30.930
I don't mind.

35
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:31.930
It's the mic.

36
00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.930
No, honey, I'll get Mike anymore.
