1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,519
Yeah, we'll get Mike a brand new Thunderblade 9x and with the toy car that comes with it.

2
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:11,480
And it will be a Christmas gift from me too.

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:26,429
Oh, by the real ones you get in the toy, oh my god, I think that's gross, but this is

4
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:27,429
gross.

5
00:00:27,429 --> 00:00:28,429
Hey Mike.

6
00:00:28,429 --> 00:00:31,510
Come on over here.

7
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:33,299
How about this?

8
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:38,810
I want you to pick out any car that you want and the car that you pick out.

9
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:44,700
The new one and the toy model, we can call it a Christmas present for you.

10
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,600
Yeah?

11
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:52,259
I want you to take this and put it in your pocket, okay?

12
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:53,649
Awesome.

13
00:00:53,649 --> 00:00:55,350
Wait Mike.

14
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,759
You jerk.

15
00:00:57,759 --> 00:00:59,759
He's going to be devastated.

16
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:02,840
I told you not to marry him.

17
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:10,120
You piece of trash divorced my girl and get out of my house.

18
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,200
Doris, it's Christmas.

19
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,200
Stay calm.

20
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,200
Philip, I've got an old friend Bob.

21
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,159
He's the auto-plans deputy director.

22
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:20,359
I'll see if he can get you a decent job.

23
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:27,780
Dad, listen, I appreciate you trying to help, but I don't think Bob can find a job that

24
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,659
kind of job do you want?

25
00:01:31,659 --> 00:01:33,019
President of the Wharton Group?
