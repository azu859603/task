00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
You want me to apologize to you?

2
00:00:06.059 --> 00:00:08.060
What is it that you do, Philip?

3
00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:09.060
Sell eggs?

4
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.539
Wash dishes?

5
00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:13.919
Maybe you're just a bum.

6
00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:14.919
You're right.

7
00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:16.920
I'm just reading myself.

8
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.920
Enough, everyone stop laughing at Philip.

9
00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.920
Okay, you're going way too far.

10
00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.920
Caroline, your husband has one redeeming quality.

11
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.019
He's hilarious.

12
00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:27.019
Andrew?

13
00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:28.019
Good.

14
00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.019
Remember every word you've just said.

15
00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:32.020
I hope you're calling to ride.

16
00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.020
You need to leave, man.

17
00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.020
Cody?

18
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.109
Bring me that idiot's father.

19
00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:37.109
What was your name again?

20
00:00:37.109 --> 00:00:38.109
Bob?

21
00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:39.369
To me.

22
00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:40.369
Now.

23
00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:41.369
See you soon, sir.

24
00:00:41.369 --> 00:00:42.399
Thank you.

25
00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:43.590
Geez.

26
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.590
Who was you talking to with such respect?

27
00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:46.590
The president?

28
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.590
You'll find out soon enough.

29
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:49.590
What?

30
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.590
Let's go, Bob, and we'll discuss the rest of the project at the party.

31
00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.590
Right away, sir.

32
00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.159
Who are you trying to impress with this act and whose father are you speaking of?

33
00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:02.159
Oh, you're not entirely stupid.

34
00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:05.159
I guess you figured out who I was talking about.

35
00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.260
You son of a...

36
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:07.989
Sir!
