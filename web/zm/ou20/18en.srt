00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
Philip and Andrew got into a fight. I'm so sorry, but we just really need your help to break him up.

2
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:11,119
Wow, thanks. Why can't he give us a break? I know. I'm so sorry. I know Philip is wrong for this,

3
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:18,370
but he was really just defending me, I promise. Well, idiot. He has completely lost it. Doesn't he know?

4
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:26,109
He could take this whole company down? Take the whole company down. I'm assuming it can't be that

5
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:31,300
serious, right? I'm gonna go and check it out. But I have to finish these financial reports before

6
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:41,070
the banquet dinner. Do you think you could handle it? Yeah, yeah, whatever we need. Just, but please

7
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:45,070
don't be too hard on Philip. Sam, what are you out standing around for? You really think it's the

8
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:56,939
big boss? Get him off of me right now. You're all fine. You scumbag. I bet your wife's running

9
00:00:56,939 --> 00:01:01,659
the fair on life now. She's the only one of us who's met the president. She's gonna take no

10
00:01:01,659 --> 00:01:06,700
shit when you would be dragged into court for any person. Yeah, what she tells the president,

11
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:11,739
the real president, he'll deal with you himself. You're gonna lose everything. Probably he'll end up

12
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:16,700
dead. Fucking instinct. You're ready to die. You're crying. You had your chance to fight for mercy.

13
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:22,750
Yeah, that's tough. I can't wait to see Pharaoh. He doesn't all be gonna see him back again. Fuck
