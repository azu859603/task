00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:04.540
There is here, you're in trouble now, you're fucked.

2
00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:05.700
Ooh.

3
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.419
Farrah, you're doing it.

4
00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:13.179
Ms. Hilling, this scumbag, but hands on me and my boy.

5
00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:14.460
You better deal with him.

6
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.260
That's right, Ms. Hilling.

7
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.059
What did Caroline say to you?

8
00:00:18.059 --> 00:00:20.899
Her husband is pretending to be president of the Wharton Group.

9
00:00:20.899 --> 00:00:23.980
And he stole a car and stole Mr. Brown.

10
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.140
Exactly.

11
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.339
He's a fraud.

12
00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:27.179
And he attacked me.

13
00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:29.260
He's a terrorist ruling in our Christmas party.

14
00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.340
You should drag him in front of the big boss and have to finish him.

15
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.880
Shut up, you idiot!

16
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.119
No, Ms. Shuey.

17
00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:38.439
You ain't gotta talk to us like that.

18
00:00:38.439 --> 00:00:44.000
I may be the only deputy manager here, but Coney himself called me to arrange this party.

19
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.649
And I have to face.

20
00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.350
Sir, I am so sorry.

21
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.109
I should have gotten here sooner.

22
00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:53.390
I was reviewing the accounts you asked me to.

23
00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.429
I had no idea these morons would disrespect you like that.

24
00:00:57.429 --> 00:00:58.429
Thank you.

25
00:00:58.429 --> 00:00:59.429
What?

26
00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:02.630
So, he is the president?

27
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.310
Oh my God, even Barrett makes you for president.
