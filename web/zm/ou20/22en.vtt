00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640
How could you be the president, these people?

2
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.919
You idiot! You put us all in a huge mess.

3
00:00:05.919 --> 00:00:08.560
Don't you know that Ravenham Auto Plant

4
00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.279
depends on Wharton's investment?

5
00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:14.720
One word from Mr. Edwards, and we're all done.

6
00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.760
Miss Ewing, he must have fooled you too.

7
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.800
He forged the president's signature. He tricked all of us.

8
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.160
Don't bother to his trap.

9
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.359
You think he forged the president's signature?

10
00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.079
That's impossible. Plus the Wharton Group website updates every day

11
00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:34.960
with directives from the president. Check and see.

12
00:00:40.929 --> 00:00:42.799
It's there. It's really there.

13
00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:48.799
And soon the website will be updated with you and your father have been fired and arrested,

14
00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:51.920
or we can make sure it gets grounded in obituary.

15
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:52.719
Your choice.

16
00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:54.079
Mr. Edwards.

17
00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:58.159
Now, Farrah, if you hadn't arrived when you did, I wouldn't be able to witness such

18
00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:01.840
wonderful performances, because the auto plant has managed to

19
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.280
breed such corrupt and power abusing parasites,

20
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.560
even the idiot like him, and be a researcher.

21
00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.719
You know, I think it's time we clean house.

22
00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:11.760
I agree.

23
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.780
I think it's time we clean house.

24
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.219
I can explain to you.

25
00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:20.340
No, actually, I think you understood everything pretty well.

26
00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:29.250
No! No! No! No! No! No! No! Please! Please!

27
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.730
You know, nobody's listening to your bullshit.

28
00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.209
And frankly, I'm not interested in it.

29
00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:43.680
See that? Every man acts tough when there's a gun put in his face,

30
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.920
and then he starts running for his mama.

31
00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.640
Pathetic! Farrah, I want you to audit every single one of them,

32
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.879
every project, every penny that has ever stepped foot into this company.

33
00:01:54.879 --> 00:01:56.239
Yes, president.

34
00:01:56.239 --> 00:01:58.480
Gentlemen, can you please take our guest away?

35
00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.769
No! No! No! No! No! No!

36
00:02:02.769 --> 00:02:05.650
Gentlemen, tell us.

37
00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.819
President, I was wrong.

38
00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.259
I never could have went there, Caroline.

39
00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.340
I should have never disrespected you.

40
00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.659
We didn't have mercy.
