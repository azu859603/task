1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:03,520
Kurt, are you okay?

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,519
Your husband needs mental therapy.

3
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:09,970
You should seriously think about leaving him before you're from being really bad.

4
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:10,970
She didn't mean it.

5
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:11,970
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:12,970
Caroline.

7
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:13,970
I don't apologize to him.

8
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:16,059
She's the one who told me first.

9
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:18,059
Philip shot off.

10
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:20,059
So what if he sets his stuff?

11
00:00:20,059 --> 00:00:22,059
You don't deserve Caroline.

12
00:00:22,059 --> 00:00:23,059
He's right about that.

13
00:00:23,059 --> 00:00:24,059
Mom.

14
00:00:24,059 --> 00:00:25,059
Enough.

15
00:00:25,059 --> 00:00:27,059
No more apologies.

16
00:00:27,059 --> 00:00:29,059
Caroline, I'm surprised for you.

17
00:00:29,059 --> 00:00:30,059
You're going to love it.

18
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:32,060
Tonight is the president's welcome bank.

19
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:36,060
Only the elites and the top executives have raving him in attendance.

20
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:39,729
This is a VIP pass.

21
00:00:39,729 --> 00:00:42,729
With this, you can take your whole family with you.
