1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,960
for all of us. Mom, Philip is right. It's not appropriate for me to go with her. I mean, I'm married.

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:15,599
Don't listen to the loser. You can come up with her together. It's not. I just need to get you

3
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:22,820
a new dress. This Kurt state is going to be a star. Okay. Don't worry. David and Tassil will be there.

4
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:31,679
I'll find them. Okay. Airline, let's go. I'll see you later, I promise. You know, tonight,

5
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:40,990
all of you are going to get a really good surprise. Merry Christmas, David. I knew I'd see you here.

6
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:47,070
Your Wharton's Finance guy in Raven Ham, after all. Yes, I am. And Merry Christmas to you too, Tessa.

7
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:50,670
Well, it looks like you're doing pretty good with the Wharton group. And a couple more years,

8
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:54,350
you'll be in the consortium for real. This banquet is for the successful few.

9
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:59,390
Looks like we're the cream of the crop from our class. I guess so. But where's Bowen?

10
00:00:59,469 --> 00:01:02,670
Thought he was a former at the auto park. I didn't expect him to miss this.

11
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:11,060
I don't know. I guess he didn't make of a cut. Well, well, well. Look who it is. Our old class

12
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:17,299
made Philip. He was top of the class. Now he's bottom of the barrel. Oh my god. Is he still in

13
00:01:17,299 --> 00:01:21,700
between jobs? How did he even get in here? I don't know. Let's go see what that schmucks up to.

14
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:34,319
Oh, I'm so sorry. Hi, Philip. How on earth did you get in here?
