00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.620
I can't believe I just married a complete stranger.

2
00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.070
Use it as you like. I'm going abroad on business.

3
00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:14.070
I don't need this.

4
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.070
Take it.

5
00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.070
After all, you're my husband.

6
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.070
Legally.

7
00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.329
But I only married you to fulfill Grandmother's wish.

8
00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:23.329
Or divorce when I return.

9
00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:26.329
Good. That's what I want as well.

10
00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:31.089
I'll return this to him while we get divorced.

11
00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.649
Don't worry, Grandmother.

12
00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:37.649
I just married William.

13
00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.740
No, Frank.

14
00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.869
Your heart was broken by your ex.

15
00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:44.869
You've stopped believing in love.

16
00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:46.259
Trust me.

17
00:00:46.259 --> 00:00:49.259
William is truly different.

18
00:00:50.259 --> 00:00:52.289
He seems fine.

19
00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.609
I've met with him. Grandmother.

20
00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:57.609
William is great. He's the one.

21
00:00:57.609 --> 00:00:58.609
Thank you.

22
00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:01.090
I know you love me.

23
00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.020
Hold on a second.

24
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.879
Mr. Clark.

25
00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:10.170
I caught the job.

26
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.939
My life isn't a complete mess.

27
00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:21.379
Everyone looks so serious today. What's going on?

28
00:01:21.379 --> 00:01:22.379
Andrew.

29
00:01:22.379 --> 00:01:23.379
Our CEO.

30
00:01:23.379 --> 00:01:25.379
The most charming man in the city.

31
00:01:25.379 --> 00:01:28.379
He's finally back after a year-long business trip.

32
00:01:28.379 --> 00:01:30.790
Look. It's him.

33
00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:43.280
It is so.

34
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.879
Have I seen him somewhere before?
