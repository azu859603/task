1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:02,049
You want to sleep with me?

2
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:16,899
Grandmother dearest yes, I just returned for my trip Andrew you're a married man married to my friend's blind son remember

3
00:00:16,899 --> 00:00:18,899
I know I've just been so busy with work

4
00:00:20,469 --> 00:00:23,609
My chose a respectable young man to be your husband

5
00:00:26,539 --> 00:00:30,019
Unlike those privileged young men you used to spend time with

6
00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:36,179
They're supposed to be just a sham marriage to fulfill grandmother's wish is he really waiting for?

7
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,920
Now go buy him a present and visit him

8
00:00:40,659 --> 00:00:46,399
All right, there are some things I need to discuss with them anyway

9
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:50,350
So I need to clarify something

10
00:00:50,869 --> 00:00:54,189
Call me conservative, but I only sleep with those I love

11
00:00:55,149 --> 00:00:57,310
We clearly don't share the same view

12
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:09,540
What if he fires me for rejecting him? I love to seduce

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,409
Plus I never force

14
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:17,170
Tell me what gift would suit a young conservative man like yourself

15
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:19,950
That depends on your relationship

16
00:01:20,069 --> 00:01:24,079
It's my husband you have a husband and you're hitting on me
