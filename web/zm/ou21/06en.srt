00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Has my so-called husband been lied to my grandmother all this time?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,769
Hello? Who is this?

3
00:00:06,769 --> 00:00:09,339
Frank, come join us.

4
00:00:09,339 --> 00:00:14,140
Sir, how was meeting your new boss today?

5
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:16,140
Is he really as handsome as they say?

6
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:19,140
He may have a great body and be very charming,

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,140
but he's married, so I won't fall for him.

8
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,140
What a pity.

9
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:26,140
He did seem strangely familiar.

10
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:28,140
I can't remember where I recognised him from.

11
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,140
Don't forget, you're married too.

12
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,140
So what? His husband disappeared right after the freaking wedding.

13
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:38,140
We've actually agreed to get a divorce.

14
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:40,140
But now I can't find him.

15
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,140
Grandmother must be mistaken.

16
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:44,140
That man is very irresponsible.

17
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:51,350
The boss doesn't look happy.

18
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:53,350
Your date go well.

19
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:54,350
He's married.

20
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:55,350
Give up on your crazy idea.

21
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,350
I know.

22
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:57,350
But the marriage isn't...

23
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:58,350
Frank.

24
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:15,719
Come here. Take over for me.

25
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:17,719
Race is every time he bends over.

26
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:22,829
He's already turned me down so I better control myself.

27
00:01:22,829 --> 00:01:29,280
Thank you, bro.

28
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,280
I can see you're really good with long sticks.

29
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,280
Maybe you can show me more of your techniques later.

30
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,280
Somewhere private.

31
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,280
I've got work to do.

32
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,280
Come on.

33
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,280
I can pay for those sessions.

34
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,280
Just name your price.

35
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,280
Sure you have one.

36
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,280
Not an interest.

37
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,280
Ouch!

38
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,310
Do you step on me?
