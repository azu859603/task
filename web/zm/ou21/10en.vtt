00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Ah, it's hard for me to control my reactions when I'm around you, but there's no need to be afraid.

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.949
I've heard rumours, but I choose to believe what I see.

3
00:00:10.949 --> 00:00:12.949
I think you're honest. Thanks.

4
00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:16.339
As long as I don't fool for him, there's nothing to fear.

5
00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:21.750
I admit, I've never been in love, so when you said that sex between two people is best when they're in love,

6
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.460
I don't really know what you mean by that. And to be frank, I'm too lazy to care.

7
00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.839
At least he's sincere. That's way less than flattery.

8
00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:38.829
Since I'm here, I'm going to have to release this pressure, so you should leave unless you want to stay.

9
00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:49.570
I know I'm a heartthrob. How could he reject this?

10
00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.490
Yes.

11
00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:56.490
I hit the diamond cuffbones we bought in this bouquet and booked the restaurants.

12
00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.490
I wish you and your husband a wonderful evening.

13
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.490
Frank, I'm actually meeting with my husband to discuss art.

14
00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:12.420
I think it's finally time for you to talk to Frank and invite him to move in with you.

15
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.420
What? Frank. Frank! Frank Clark!

16
00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.840
You can remember your husband's name.

17
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.840
I'm Frank Clark. I've been working here for...
