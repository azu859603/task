1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,940
Yeah, it's the same name as my husband. No wonder it felt so familiar. Could they be the same person?

2
00:00:06,419 --> 00:00:10,619
I'll be waiting. I can't sleep until I see him tonight.

3
00:00:11,619 --> 00:00:14,300
Okay, don't worry. I'm bringing to you as soon as possible.

4
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:21,429
Thanks so much. Don't go get a bottle of wine from the car. All right.

5
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:24,829
Sir, we're here.

6
00:00:24,829 --> 00:00:29,140
Frank, what if it's really you?

7
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:54,579
Either just Frank Clark live here. Yes, and who are you?

8
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,149
Who are you looking for?

9
00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:01,460
So my husband is fooling around with another man, and he doesn't even recognize me.

10
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:05,159
What's your relationship to him?

11
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:08,120
We've been together for years.

12
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:21,780
I'm so glad your husband's never around.

13
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:32,780
Got a problem with that. You better leave before I beat you up.

14
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:41,069
So you lied to grandmother about being single?

15
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,980
Disgusting.

16
00:01:43,980 --> 00:02:01,879
Is it me, or does he look like my boss?

17
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:05,780
I stay with the most don't go get a bottle of wine from the car. All right, all right, I'm going.

18
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:23,289
That looks familiar.

19
00:02:23,289 --> 00:02:32,520
Did you see some strange guy around here?

20
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,520
Common side is not safe. No, what was it?

21
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:43,810
Another heartbroken young man. What a waste of beautiful flowers.

22
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:52,650
Diamond clinks. I fit the jackpot.

23
00:02:53,289 --> 00:03:00,300
Some straight guys came and asked for you, and it questioned my relationship with Lewis.

24
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:03,379
I didn't know bashes were still around. He was really weird.

25
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:09,020
But also, we had really hot. Okay, just go and brush it.

26
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:13,400
So he was looking for me.

27
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,879
Maybe it really was my boss.

28
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:19,060
Or perhaps my husband.

29
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,060
The flowers.

30
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:25,740
I must be losing my mind.

31
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:29,000
Why were the boss leaf flowers at my door anyway?

32
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,419
He'd give them to his husband.

33
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:37,599
Why?

34
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:42,539
Andrew, where's Frank?

35
00:03:42,539 --> 00:03:45,539
Why have you come alone without him?

36
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:47,539
It's with his secret lover.

37
00:03:47,539 --> 00:03:49,539
They've been living together for years.

38
00:03:49,539 --> 00:03:51,610
Secret lover?

39
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:52,610
Really?

40
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:54,669
I saw it with my own two eyes.

41
00:03:54,669 --> 00:03:57,830
I went to visit him and he was in the bath with another guy.

42
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:01,400
I'm divorcing.

43
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,460
Are you sure?

44
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,460
Don't make any spontaneous decision.

45
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,460
Maybe.

46
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:10,460
I only married him to fulfill your wish grandmother.

47
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,460
But it's done.

48
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,460
I don't need this marriage anymore.

49
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:18,579
Your parents failed marriage.

50
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:21,579
Doesn't mean all marriages are unhappy.

51
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:24,600
Want you to find love?

52
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,600
Love.

53
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:40,490
Maybe I will, but it's definitely not with him.

54
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:42,490
Do you have to divorce agreement immediately?

55
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:47,019
I might have made a big mistake.

56
00:04:47,019 --> 00:05:01,649
Hello, sir.

57
00:05:01,649 --> 00:05:03,610
This is Andrew's friend.

58
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:04,610
He needs your help.

59
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:07,339
Come to the red club's problem.

60
00:05:07,339 --> 00:05:09,589
What? Now?

61
00:05:09,589 --> 00:05:10,589
What? Now?

62
00:05:10,589 --> 00:05:11,689
Yes.

63
00:05:11,689 --> 00:05:12,689
He's very drunk.

64
00:05:12,689 --> 00:05:16,620
So I guess part of being an assistant is picking up your drunk boss.

65
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:34,269
I'm just here to pick up Andrew.

66
00:05:34,269 --> 00:05:36,500
I mean, my boss.

67
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,500
You're Frank.

68
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:42,879
Andrew never mentioned his assistant was so handsome.

69
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:46,509
Well, thank you.

70
00:05:46,509 --> 00:05:47,509
You've got a boyfriend.

71
00:05:47,509 --> 00:05:48,509
What?

72
00:05:48,509 --> 00:05:52,670
If not, we could mainly go on a date sometime.

73
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:55,500
Let me just pick up my boss.

74
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,500
Damn.

75
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,500
You must be losing my charm.

76
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,399
Unless you're interested in your boss.

77
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:04,399
Do you find Andrew attractive?

78
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:15,740
Andrew was also over losing his charm.

79
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,740
First his husband cheats on him.

80
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:20,740
And now his handsome assistant is an even interested.

81
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:26,740
Actually, I don't know a gay guy who didn't want to sleep with him.

82
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:29,089
Listen.

83
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:31,089
I'm divorcing that bastard, okay?

84
00:06:31,089 --> 00:06:33,089
And as for Frank, yeah.

85
00:06:33,089 --> 00:06:37,089
He may be rejecting me now, but I swear I'll make him fall for me.

86
00:06:37,089 --> 00:06:40,089
In fact, his heart will soon be mine.

87
00:06:40,089 --> 00:06:45,750
Well, I hope he doesn't remember this drunk talk when he wakes up.

88
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:49,490
Be careful with Mr. Playboy's intentions.

89
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:52,490
He's never pursued or cared for anyone before.

90
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:53,490
You're a first.

91
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:54,490
Not interested.

92
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:59,420
For us men, physical attraction comes before feelings, too.

93
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,420
You can't fool yourself.

94
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:08,689
Okay.

95
00:07:08,689 --> 00:07:09,939
You're all set.

96
00:07:09,939 --> 00:07:11,360
I'm going to make my way.

97
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:20,329
Yes, sir.

98
00:07:20,329 --> 00:07:22,740
You've got such an annoying thing.

99
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:32,420
You're the same, Frank.

100
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:33,459
She's dead old.

101
00:07:33,459 --> 00:07:37,459
Damn it.

102
00:07:37,459 --> 00:07:41,860
You just stay over there.

103
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,019
You need some time to sober up.

104
00:07:44,019 --> 00:07:47,720
I guess no Frank can be trusted.

105
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,720
Just like my husband.

106
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,540
You're not like my husband.

107
00:07:52,540 --> 00:08:03,250
You've got to resist this temptation.

108
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,250
He's my boss.

109
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,439
I can't make the same mistake again.

110
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:24,420
But I swear I'll make him fall for me.

111
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:27,420
In fact, his heart will soon be mine.

112
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,420
Me?

113
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:34,509
What's the best way to seduce a man like Frank?

114
00:08:34,509 --> 00:08:37,149
Besides execute?

115
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:43,570
Did he fall asleep already?

116
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:53,409
With me, you'll have money.

117
00:08:53,409 --> 00:08:55,759
A car, a house.

118
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:56,759
A better career.

119
00:08:56,759 --> 00:08:58,980
I promise.

120
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:02,429
It seems like you thought about this story.

121
00:09:02,429 --> 00:09:05,659
You know, my ex-partners never got this kind of treatment.

122
00:09:05,659 --> 00:09:07,659
But you're a special Frank.

123
00:09:07,659 --> 00:09:11,340
Relax.

124
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:14,179
I want to make you feel good.

125
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:15,179
Or maybe.

126
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:17,690
I can make you feel better.

127
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:26,210
Close your eyes.

128
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:32,620
Oh, it's this.

129
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:33,940
Oh, it's this.

130
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:34,940
Oh, it's this.

131
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:47,019
I'm putting you on trial.

132
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:48,019
First.

133
00:09:48,019 --> 00:09:50,240
You're a superficial.

134
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,240
You failed to seduce me once.

135
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,710
You tried all these other lame techniques.

136
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:59,710
Money, power and physique are the biggest assets of a man.

137
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:03,419
You failed to seduce me because this isn't temptation.

138
00:10:03,419 --> 00:10:05,419
This is a transaction.

139
00:10:05,419 --> 00:10:07,539
Second.

140
00:10:07,539 --> 00:10:08,629
You're arrogant.

141
00:10:08,629 --> 00:10:10,889
Can't I die properly?

142
00:10:10,889 --> 00:10:11,889
Then learn.

143
00:10:11,889 --> 00:10:16,360
I invite a man you need to be served.

144
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,830
This isn't just about sex for me.

145
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:27,110
I want something more.

146
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,110
I value this job.

147
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:31,110
If I have to sell myself for it, I'd rather be five.

148
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:34,940
And tonight be the night you learn all this.

149
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:38,179
I'm in third.

150
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:42,440
You're a cheater.

151
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:54,330
You're the only one I lost.

152
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:56,870
Move north with me.

153
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,639
You little bitch.

154
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:00,639
You seduced my husband of five years.

155
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:02,639
You turned him into a cheater.

156
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:03,639
You're fired.

157
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:11,620
I just hate married men.

158
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:20,049
You cheat.

159
00:11:20,049 --> 00:11:21,049
I'm getting so obsessed with you.

160
00:11:21,049 --> 00:11:32,679
You're getting fired.

161
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:35,610
That's none of your business.

162
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:37,610
You failed to sleep with the boss.

163
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:39,610
And now you're losing your job.

164
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:41,659
Done.

165
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:46,429
How about it was the boss who tried to sleep with me?

166
00:11:46,429 --> 00:11:50,659
Your husband has been the second relationship during this marriage.

167
00:11:50,659 --> 00:11:54,659
So he wanted to pay two million composition after divorce.

168
00:11:54,659 --> 00:11:56,659
This would be a proper punishment.

169
00:11:56,659 --> 00:11:59,299
Especially for lying to grandmother.

170
00:11:59,299 --> 00:12:03,120
Set up a meeting to discuss this.

171
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,120
Sir?

172
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,759
I can accept being fired, but you must pay me severance.

173
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:11,529
And you must not smear my reputation.

174
00:12:11,529 --> 00:12:13,779
I don't intend to fire you.

175
00:12:13,779 --> 00:12:14,779
What?

176
00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:15,779
I've been reflecting.

177
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:18,779
I'd like to apologise for my recklessness and my arrogance.

178
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:21,649
Did he realise his mistakes?

179
00:12:21,649 --> 00:12:23,840
Frank, I want you to stay in this position.

180
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:27,639
And I want you to join me for a party tomorrow night.

181
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:34,860
Are you really not angry?

182
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:40,200
So you've given up on your ridiculous plan to seduce me and trick me into bed?

183
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:53,899
No.

184
00:12:54,899 --> 00:13:01,929
Well that's great, but...

185
00:13:01,929 --> 00:13:02,929
No.

186
00:13:02,929 --> 00:13:06,950
I'm not sure if getting a divorce now is a good thing.

187
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:18,409
Considering this can encourage Andrew even more.

188
00:13:18,409 --> 00:13:20,409
I remember you asked if I had a boyfriend.

189
00:13:20,409 --> 00:13:25,700
But the truth is, I'm not dating anyone because I'm already married.

190
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:29,700
That's the most creative excuse I've ever heard.

191
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,700
I'm not lying.

192
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,700
My husband is...

193
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,720
Cruz.

194
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,720
Stop bothering my sister.

195
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,779
Whatever.

196
00:13:37,779 --> 00:13:40,029
Cruz!

197
00:13:40,029 --> 00:13:42,029
You must have heard everything.

198
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:45,029
I think I need to explain why I never mentioned my marriage before.

199
00:13:45,029 --> 00:13:51,139
So, about my husband, Frank.

200
00:13:51,139 --> 00:13:55,700
Do you really love your husband?

201
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,460
Do you really love your husband?

202
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:02,460
Andrew is not polite to ask people questions like that.

203
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:07,100
This Martin, Frank, Andrew...

204
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:12,470
How about we play Truth or Dare?

205
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:13,470
I'm gay.

206
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:24,809
I'm in.

207
00:14:24,809 --> 00:14:28,809
I don't want to lie, but I don't want Andrew to keep pursuing me either.

208
00:14:28,809 --> 00:14:29,809
You lost.

209
00:14:29,809 --> 00:14:32,059
Truth or Dare?

210
00:14:32,059 --> 00:14:34,309
Truth.

211
00:14:34,309 --> 00:14:38,659
So tell us which cutie left these marks on you.

212
00:14:38,659 --> 00:14:46,669
If you don't answer, your face of punishment worse than the dare would have been.

213
00:14:46,669 --> 00:14:48,669
Punishment? I'm not afraid of punishment.

214
00:14:48,669 --> 00:14:51,429
It was me.

215
00:14:51,429 --> 00:15:11,450
I'd choose dare.

216
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:23,710
Frank, now turn around and drink this drink down to the last drink.

217
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:25,710
Enough of this game.

218
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:41,509
What a romantic moment.

219
00:15:41,509 --> 00:15:46,340
But the dare isn't completed.

220
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,820
Game over.

221
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:50,820
And no one gets Frank into trouble.

222
00:15:50,820 --> 00:16:02,379
Sorry.

223
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:05,210
I'm being impulsive again.

224
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:09,830
Thank you for helping me.

225
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:11,830
Well, I should be off.

226
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:12,860
Wait.

227
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:17,779
Frank, if you truly love your husband,

228
00:16:17,779 --> 00:16:21,779
then I promise I'll force myself to suppress my desires.

229
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:28,120
But you choosing dare already tells me how you feel.

230
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,409
Forget it.

231
00:16:30,409 --> 00:16:33,759
I'm not going to suppress the things.

232
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,179
Seems like nothing's going to change his mind.

233
00:16:37,179 --> 00:16:43,379
I almost forgot I asked Jack to pick me up.

234
00:16:43,379 --> 00:16:48,610
This be his husband.

235
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:52,179
Seems like he thinks Jack is my jerk of a husband.

236
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:54,250
Maybe that's even better.

237
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,080
Goodbye, sir.

238
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:04,990
You're totally wasted, aren't you?

239
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:05,990
No.

240
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:11,289
Just play a lot.

241
00:17:11,289 --> 00:17:12,289
You're right.

242
00:17:12,289 --> 00:17:14,349
You know we're not going to let anyone hurt you again.

243
00:17:14,349 --> 00:17:15,349
Right.

244
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:17,119
Thank you.

245
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:23,990
They do look like hubbies.

246
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:24,990
Really?

247
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:28,089
I think Frank's just putting on a show for me.

248
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:29,089
Whoa.

249
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:33,089
Who knew the almighty Andrew could get so jealous?

250
00:17:33,089 --> 00:17:37,119
Seeing him with another guy only adds fuel to my burning desire.

251
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:38,119
Okay.

252
00:17:38,119 --> 00:17:39,119
For real.

253
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:44,119
Who thought this heartless playboy of 20 years would suffer to get a guy?

254
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:47,700
Well, you know I think this time something's different.

255
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,700
Maybe you're falling in love.

256
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:53,210
I've never been in love so I don't know what it feels like.

257
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:57,299
Besides, I can't get him to be even remotely interested in me.

258
00:17:57,299 --> 00:18:00,369
I think you need to earn his trust first.

259
00:18:00,369 --> 00:18:02,359
Trust.

260
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:06,960
I swear he has absolutely no shame.

261
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,089
Frank, quickly.

262
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:16,819
Check the company website.

263
00:18:16,819 --> 00:18:18,819
These are clearly photoshopped.

264
00:18:18,819 --> 00:18:24,299
Who repostes the company website?

265
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:29,099
So, he has a husband and a boyfriend at the same time.

266
00:18:29,099 --> 00:18:30,099
Disgusting.

267
00:18:30,099 --> 00:18:34,099
Juicing a married man at work shame on you.

268
00:18:34,099 --> 00:18:36,099
My husband said that you came onto him.

269
00:18:36,099 --> 00:18:38,099
Who knows how many men you've slept with.

270
00:18:38,099 --> 00:18:39,099
You must be fine.

271
00:18:39,099 --> 00:18:46,660
Hey, did I burn your hand?

272
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:47,660
Mr. Mann Hall.

273
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:48,660
You bastard.

274
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,660
You've been destroying this company's reputation.

275
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:53,660
You have the audacity to still be here.

276
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:58,539
Are those photos real?

277
00:18:58,539 --> 00:18:59,539
It's the boss.

278
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:05,759
Come in.

279
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:11,539
Sir, I'm sorry about this mess.

280
00:19:11,539 --> 00:19:12,539
I'll resign.

281
00:19:12,539 --> 00:19:13,609
But I need to explain it.

282
00:19:13,609 --> 00:19:14,609
Why?

283
00:19:14,609 --> 00:19:15,640
Did you do something wrong?

284
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:18,640
Did you see the photos on the website?

285
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,640
The company's stock has dropped because of these.

286
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,640
I don't care about those rumors.

287
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,279
I trust you and I know it's all false.

288
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:28,470
I believe you'll prove me right.

289
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:33,309
Thank you.

290
00:19:33,309 --> 00:19:37,539
Peter, tell the IT team to give Frank their full support.

291
00:19:37,539 --> 00:19:38,539
Got it.

292
00:19:38,539 --> 00:19:41,880
I need to trust him before he trusts me.

293
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:46,630
Sir, it was Darry.

294
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:51,059
You need to come with us.

295
00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:53,059
Do you even know who my uncle is?

296
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:54,059
Hey, let me go.

297
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:55,059
Where are you fighting?

298
00:19:55,059 --> 00:19:56,059
What?

299
00:19:56,059 --> 00:19:59,700
Next time you frame someone, be more creative.

300
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,700
Don't just spread stupid rules.

301
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,700
I promise this is no one but let me go.

302
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,950
You shouldn't be taking you as well.

303
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:10,180
Gary framed me for my position.

304
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:13,180
Don't forget the boss chose me personally for this role.

305
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:16,390
So no one can take you from me.

306
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:18,059
Boss.

307
00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:25,529
He's right.

308
00:20:25,529 --> 00:20:26,720
Now get back to work.

309
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:36,960
Aw, so he likes being around with me.

310
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:42,190
Thank you.

311
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:43,190
For what?

312
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:46,190
I know you contacted the IT team.

313
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:49,190
Without your help, I wouldn't have figured out it was Gary so quickly.

314
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:51,190
The boss asked me to do it.

315
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:52,190
You should thank him.

316
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:57,250
I've been thinking, maybe I'm too biased against Andrew.

317
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,250
He's actually never headed.

318
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,950
Just level headed?

319
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:02,950
He's also answer.

320
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:05,750
I'm serious.

321
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,750
His body shaped like a real...

322
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:08,750
Like a real what?

323
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:14,950
Um, like a real gym buff.

324
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:16,950
I was just saying how great fitness is.

325
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:17,950
Is that it?

326
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:23,140
You know, abs are the only impressive thing about my body.

327
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:31,420
Please throw it through these documents in the next few days.

328
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:32,740
Sure.

329
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:37,319
Come with me.

330
00:21:37,319 --> 00:21:48,119
You don't have to do this.

331
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:50,119
After all, you're my boss.

332
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:52,150
It's after working ours already.

333
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:53,539
Thank you.

334
00:21:53,539 --> 00:21:55,890
For believing in me.

335
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:59,039
I just hope that someday you'll trust me.

336
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,039
Someday you'll trust me the way I trust you.

337
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:09,819
It's your husband.

338
00:22:09,819 --> 00:22:10,819
No response.

339
00:22:10,819 --> 00:22:11,819
Well then go to his house.

340
00:22:11,819 --> 00:22:14,650
Do I need to teach you how to find someone?

341
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:15,650
Maybe I should leave.

342
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:18,319
Actually, he's house right now.

343
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:21,319
I've been knocking for a while, but no one's answering.

344
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:23,319
Okay, just give me a second.

345
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:30,019
It's William, your husband.

346
00:22:30,019 --> 00:22:32,019
We need to meet and discuss the divorce.

347
00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:46,430
I'm sorry sir.

348
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:48,430
I have dinner plans with my friends today.

349
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:50,430
It must be them trying to reach me.

350
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:51,430
That's all right.

351
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:56,819
Have a nice evening.

352
00:22:56,819 --> 00:22:58,819
What am I thinking?

353
00:22:58,819 --> 00:23:06,309
How could he possibly have received the message I sent to that bastard?

354
00:23:06,309 --> 00:23:07,660
Hmm.

355
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:08,660
Thank you guys for cooking.

356
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:11,660
Looks like your boss wants you to work 24 hours a day.

357
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:12,660
No.

358
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:15,759
Believe it or not, he just cares about his employees.

359
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:16,759
Something's off.

360
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:18,759
You're defending him.

361
00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:20,950
Are you failing for him?

362
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:21,950
What?

363
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:22,950
No.

364
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:25,950
Don't forget you used to love a husband you haven't divorced you.

365
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:26,950
That reminds me.

366
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:28,950
I totally forgot to reply to that message.

367
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:32,809
It's William, your husband.

368
00:23:32,809 --> 00:23:34,809
We need to meet and discuss the divorce.

369
00:23:34,809 --> 00:23:35,809
Where are you?

370
00:23:35,809 --> 00:23:37,809
Why haven't you replied to my message?

371
00:23:37,809 --> 00:23:39,809
Seems like my husband is losing his patience.

372
00:23:39,809 --> 00:23:40,809
Why?

373
00:23:40,809 --> 00:23:43,099
Trying to get rid of me as soon as possible.

374
00:23:43,099 --> 00:23:47,640
Disappearing for so long only to message me about a divorce.

375
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,769
What an impossible man.

376
00:23:49,769 --> 00:23:53,250
If you don't want your boss to keep trying to get in bed with you,

377
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:58,250
you can actually delay this divorce and then use your marriage as a reason to keep a distance from him.

378
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:03,250
Just forget that this silly marriage is more annoying than Andrew.

379
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:10,430
I've been busy today.

380
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:12,430
We can meet Sunday at 10am.

381
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:14,430
You think you guys?

382
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:24,200
Andrew.

383
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,200
Sorry boss.

384
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,200
Frank, what are you doing here?

385
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,769
Sorry boss.

386
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:31,769
Frank, what are you doing here?

387
00:24:31,769 --> 00:24:33,769
I'm just here to meet up.

388
00:24:33,769 --> 00:24:35,339
Hello?

389
00:24:35,339 --> 00:24:37,339
Hold on, I'm coming. Right away.

390
00:24:37,339 --> 00:24:38,339
It's urgent.

391
00:24:38,339 --> 00:24:40,339
We've got to take the next flight for a business trip.

392
00:24:40,339 --> 00:24:41,339
Come.

393
00:24:41,339 --> 00:24:55,740
I'm sorry, some work things popped up.

394
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,740
When will you be free then?

395
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:58,740
I don't know.

396
00:24:58,740 --> 00:24:59,740
Oh, cool whenever I can.

397
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:02,740
Don't play games to avoid this divorce.

398
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:03,740
Where are you?

399
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:08,119
Well, if you're going to speak like that, I might refuse to sign the agreement at all.

400
00:25:08,119 --> 00:25:10,119
I'm doing it.

401
00:25:10,119 --> 00:25:12,119
What you're doing here?
