00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.439
Which agreement are you selling?

2
00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:02.799
It's nothing important.

3
00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:14.699
Listen, we must seal the deal with Big Shot tonight.

4
00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:16.460
He's one of the best players.

5
00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.059
But we're going to have competition tonight

6
00:00:18.059 --> 00:00:19.899
trying to snatch it away from us.

7
00:00:19.899 --> 00:00:31.859
That... that's him.

8
00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.420
What's wrong?

9
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.340
I'm fine.

10
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.789
Big Shot.

11
00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:40.829
Here we are.

12
00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.579
You know, I like a quick deal.

13
00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:44.460
So here's how it is.

14
00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.500
I can bring you 5% more.

15
00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:49.969
I'm going to be honest, man.

16
00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:52.990
Get his companies off of bird farms.

17
00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.060
But we started negotiating first.

18
00:00:56.909 --> 00:00:59.340
Why don't you take a gamble with me?

19
00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:01.229
Maybe I'll give you a chance.

20
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.600
I'm not good at cards.

21
00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:06.430
Then it's up to your luck.

22
00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.030
I really want to waste your time.

23
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.549
Our company is simply invincible.

24
00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:11.230
It's dishonest business practices.

25
00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.829
You're completely disregarding this standard etiquette.

26
00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:22.079
Let me meet this gamble.

27
00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:24.209
Trust me.
