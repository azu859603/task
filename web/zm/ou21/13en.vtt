00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:09.050
There's no need to be nervous I can totally afford to lose this game. I won't lose

2
00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:11.890
Hey, dude Frank

3
00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:14.099
Long time no see

4
00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:52.179
I've won. I hope that means you'll be doing business with us

5
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.899
What a dope game Frank

6
00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.219
Why don't you work for me?

7
00:00:58.799 --> 00:01:05.040
Let me a price. I make it happen. No, I don't think I can agree to having my assistant switch jobs

8
00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.439
I'm sorry. I have no such intentions. Very well

9
00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:12.879
You two

10
00:01:12.879 --> 00:01:17.659
Make a good match. I like working straight forward people like you

11
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.680
Don't be fooled by this Frank guy

12
00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.459
Three years ago. He seduced me into having an affair and then was fired now

13
00:01:26.019 --> 00:01:32.939
We're gonna fare with his new boss. That's just pathetic slander. My lawyers will be sending you a cease-and-dissist letter suit

14
00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:38.760
Hey Frank, how does it feel to be a sugar baby? I know all your secrets

15
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.870
Oh my god, my god, my god

16
00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.870
You fucking bastard
