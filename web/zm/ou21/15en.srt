1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,600
Who are you married to?

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:06,219
It's not that boss, it's shut up.

3
00:00:06,219 --> 00:00:10,080
You're not even worthy of mentioning it.

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,750
I don't care if you're married.

5
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:14,980
All right?

6
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:16,980
I could be your secret lover.

7
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,179
A seduction of married men at work, shame on you.

8
00:00:20,179 --> 00:00:22,780
Liar, my husband said that you came on to him.

9
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:24,780
You must be fired.

10
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:28,100
Why did I ever find you attractive?

11
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:33,219
Frank, if this corporation fails, I'll be fired.

12
00:00:33,219 --> 00:00:34,219
Okay?

13
00:00:34,219 --> 00:00:35,570
Just help me.

14
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:37,140
Go to hell.

15
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,140
You've forgotten all the crazy times we've spent together.

16
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,679
No one can make you come like I can.

17
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:45,679
Get off me.

18
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:49,060
Fuck you, prick!

19
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:51,179
I'm dead!

20
00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:57,939
Sir, your assistant is in trouble.
