00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:08.419
Can I tell you a secret?

2
00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:13.779
You can tell me anything.

3
00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:23.100
I've been hiding my sexual orientation and my conservative hometown.

4
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.100
My whole life.

5
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.149
Hiding in fear and sadness.

6
00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:32.229
Until three years ago.

7
00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:34.740
I thought I found her.

8
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:46.890
Sorry, I'm travelling.

9
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.240
I've got a bit lost.

10
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.240
You can head to the town from here.

11
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.240
Thanks.

12
00:00:52.240 --> 00:01:01.219
Or maybe I could stay at your place?

13
00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:11.799
Is it okay to hold hands?

14
00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:13.799
It's not a small town anymore.

15
00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.799
I've opened a gay culture here.

16
00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:23.569
Hey, you're safe now.

17
00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:27.569
From a very young age when I realised I was gay.

18
00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:30.340
I've always felt alienated.

19
00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.159
Only my grandmother knew my secret.

20
00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:43.840
You first.

21
00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.930
I lived my worst nightmare.
