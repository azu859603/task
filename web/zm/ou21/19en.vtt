00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
He's so determined, but is there really a chance for us, even after the divorce?

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:13.449
Morning, so I just got out of the shower, it's not intentional.

3
00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:14.449
What do you mean?

4
00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:19.789
No, I'm not trying to show off my physique like before.

5
00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:22.789
Anyways, we should get going, we have to leave soon.

6
00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:32.740
Thank you, for last night, for listening and making it easier, you can always count on.

7
00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:42.179
He's almost like a completely different person all of a sudden.

8
00:00:42.179 --> 00:00:44.590
Frank, I can give you a lift.

9
00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.880
It's fine. Someone's putting me up.

10
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:57.820
Are you kidding me?

11
00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.820
Our he and his husband getting back together.

12
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.920
Frank!

13
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.319
We're good, are you?

14
00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:10.319
Did this trip change something?

15
00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:17.230
I feel like I'm slowly losing control around that trip.

16
00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.230
Well, a British writer once said,

17
00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.230
affection can be restrained,

18
00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.969
but love is unrestrained.

19
00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:27.969
Love.

20
00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:29.969
Frank, you deserve to be happy.

21
00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:31.969
Yes, you do.

22
00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:33.290
Thanks, guys.

23
00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:39.310
I'm here now.

24
00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:48.920
The agreement.

25
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:49.920
And if so...

26
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:50.920
I agree!

27
00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:51.920
The sooner the better.
