00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:07,480
If you have no issue with this divorce paper, be a sight right here.

2
00:00:08,769 --> 00:00:12,800
I've never signed a divorce agreement before, so I need to read this carefully.

3
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:23,210
Frank Clark must pay William Kensington £2 million in compensation damages for reputation damages.

4
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:26,210
Why the hell should I pay £2 million?

5
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,210
We both know what happens.

6
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:34,460
If you play dumb, you can take a more brutal way.

7
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,460
I'm not signing. If you want a divorce, we can settle it in court.

8
00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:45,600
I won't stand for any false accusations, I won't pay him a penny.

9
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:53,310
Give me a second. I don't want to have any connection with him anymore.

10
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:59,310
It's fine. I just want to get divorced fast. I don't want to have any connection with him anymore.

11
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:08,239
Your husband just raved your conversation. Take a look at this.

12
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:33,060
Why does his handwriting look so much like Frank's?
