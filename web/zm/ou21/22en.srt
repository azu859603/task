00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
I'm sorry, sir. Are you a family member of Mr. Cox?

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,480
Boss?

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:08,580
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:14,439
Apparently I forgot that he has a husband to take care of him and that I'm just his boss.

5
00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:18,440
Peter, upgrade his VIP services and pay off all the Michelle's.

6
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:35,380
Where's your handsome assistant? It's been a while since I've seen him.

7
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,109
Why would anyone be interested in a married man?

8
00:00:38,109 --> 00:00:41,109
Well, clearly I'm better than his husband would be.

9
00:00:41,109 --> 00:00:43,109
Stop messing around.

10
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:45,109
I won't back down.

11
00:00:45,109 --> 00:00:47,109
You haven't given up on him yet, have you?

12
00:00:47,109 --> 00:00:52,090
I feel sad.

13
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:56,820
Why does my first love have to be so complicated?

14
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,820
So it is love.

15
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:04,450
You always say you'd be a playboy, it's not to get your feelings hurt.

16
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:07,439
I was wrong.

17
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,049
Is it too late to change my mind?

18
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:13,049
You're William Kensington for God's sake.

19
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:16,049
You're the most charming man in this city.

20
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:17,180
How ironic.

21
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:20,180
The charm clearly doesn't work on him.

22
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:30,569
Cheers. The true love.

23
00:01:30,569 --> 00:01:45,310
Your boss isn't happy.

24
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:47,310
His damn husband hurt him again.

25
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,310
You should come and take him home.
