1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,230
You're so late, what are you doing?

2
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:13,330
I've got to go find my boss.

3
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:20,219
Babe, guess what?

4
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:22,539
I think Frank might be in love again.

5
00:00:22,539 --> 00:00:31,510
What are you doing here?

6
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:32,509
Cruz told me.

7
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:36,729
He's drunk and he's divorced and his husband.

8
00:00:36,729 --> 00:00:38,729
Now's your chance.

9
00:00:38,729 --> 00:00:41,049
You're kidding.

10
00:00:41,049 --> 00:00:45,049
Most guys want to be with him, but most don't get the chance to meet him.

11
00:00:45,049 --> 00:00:47,049
And yet you're with him every day.

12
00:00:47,049 --> 00:00:50,259
He genuinely cares for you.

13
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:53,060
Isn't that precious?

14
00:00:53,060 --> 00:01:04,769
Frank, I don't need you to take me home.

15
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:07,180
Or Lucas to come and get me.

16
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:10,180
Andrew, you're drunk.

17
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:13,849
Frank can take you home.

18
00:01:13,849 --> 00:01:16,129
Come on.

19
00:01:16,129 --> 00:01:22,739
Okay, well, have a good night.

20
00:01:22,739 --> 00:01:30,379
Doctor, just everything.
