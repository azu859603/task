1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Surprise!

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Alan, what are you doing here?

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Oh, I missed you, obviously.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Oh, but I'm busy.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
It's not a good time.

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
It's best if you left.

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Andrew, your mother asked me to visit you personally.

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
You wouldn't want to upset her, would you?

9
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,179
Who's this?

10
00:00:17,179 --> 00:00:18,179
You're a strange husband.

11
00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:20,179
That's a misunderstanding.

12
00:00:20,179 --> 00:00:22,179
I'm just his assistant.

13
00:00:22,179 --> 00:00:23,179
Just.

14
00:00:23,179 --> 00:00:26,899
Just?

15
00:00:26,899 --> 00:00:31,420
Apparently.

16
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:32,420
Shouldn't you be funny some work to do?

17
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:33,420
Mr. Assistant.

18
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:34,420
Whatever.

19
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:45,630
Andrew and I used to be neighbors.

20
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:47,659
We grew up together, went to school together,

21
00:00:47,659 --> 00:00:51,560
and the first man he slept with.

22
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:55,960
I know, he slept with tons of men.

23
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:01,380
So if he sleeps with you, he's still going to end up with me.

24
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:05,900
Are you sure about that?
