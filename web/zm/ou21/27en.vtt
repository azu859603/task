00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
A signature can wait, I can't resist you.

2
00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.969
So if you keep this up, I'll leave the sue you awkward.

3
00:00:06.969 --> 00:00:10.800
Well, everything was fine this morning.

4
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.769
This morning was a mistake.

5
00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:14.810
I've realized we're not compatible.

6
00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:18.260
I stopped teasing me, Frank.

7
00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:19.739
You're my boss.

8
00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:21.859
I'm your assistant.

9
00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:24.589
Let's keep it strictly professional.

10
00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:25.949
Wait, wait.

11
00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.309
It's my birthday next week.

12
00:00:27.309 --> 00:00:30.359
And as my assistant, I expect you to attend the party.

13
00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:31.679
Don't worry.

14
00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.170
I will.

15
00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:36.810
Maybe this is what love is.

16
00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:45.939
I've heard it makes people erratic.

17
00:00:45.939 --> 00:00:46.939
Frank, Clark?

18
00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:48.100
Someone wants to see you.

19
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.939
You must come to us.

20
00:00:48.939 --> 00:00:49.420
What?

21
00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:50.219
What's wrong with you?

22
00:00:50.219 --> 00:01:00.469
Crazy.

23
00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:03.780
So, what do you think of my son Andrew?

24
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.750
Do you like him?

25
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.349
These men dragged me here, just so you could ask me that.

26
00:01:10.349 --> 00:01:14.030
Because if you do like him, I can make sure he marries you.
