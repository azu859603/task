1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:04,139
I'm already married, and I love my husband.

2
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:13,810
He stayed the night at Andrew's immediately out of sight in your divorce agreement.

3
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:15,810
Oh, how you love your husband.

4
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:17,809
You've been spying on me.

5
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:23,250
I know everything about you, including your ex, Gint.

6
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:24,250
You just said?

7
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:26,250
The way I say you have two options.

8
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:30,309
The first is to resign and leave the city immediately.

9
00:00:30,309 --> 00:00:35,310
The second is to stay and expect for your life to be entirely ruined.

10
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:39,310
Trust me, you will be miserable than you were three years ago.

11
00:00:41,409 --> 00:00:42,409
I won't resign.

12
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:44,409
I won't need the city either.

13
00:00:44,409 --> 00:00:47,619
Is that so?

14
00:00:47,619 --> 00:00:49,619
Let's wait and see.

15
00:00:49,619 --> 00:00:53,979
Should you tell Andrew about this encounter with us?

16
00:00:53,979 --> 00:00:59,979
You should be very worried about what can happen to that grandmother of yours.

17
00:00:59,979 --> 00:01:02,420
Don't you dare?

18
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:06,459
Thomas, I've got this guest out of my house.

19
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:19,489
Madam, he's just an assistant.

20
00:01:19,489 --> 00:01:20,489
Why do you care?

21
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:22,810
Just an assistant.

22
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:25,810
He is the guy that Andrew married.

23
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:27,030
What?

24
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:28,030
Frank's Andrew's husband?

25
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:29,030
Why?

26
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:30,030
Why didn't he tell me?

27
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:32,799
He doesn't know.

28
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:33,799
Frank is up to something.

29
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:34,930
He can smell the money.

30
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:37,250
So Andrew doesn't know?

31
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:42,859
He mistook some guy for his husband, and wrongly assumed he was cheating, so he wants a divorce.

32
00:01:42,859 --> 00:01:45,079
What do we do?

33
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:50,140
They've already signed the divorce agreement, but they meet in court next week.

34
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,140
Who knows what will happen after this?

35
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:56,340
We have to ensure that Frank's infidelity becomes clean.

36
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:06,269
I can handle that.

37
00:02:06,269 --> 00:02:08,270
Did he hear a conversation?
