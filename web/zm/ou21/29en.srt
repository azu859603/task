1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,330
Lucas, get him out of my side.

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,169
Andrew, I'm sorry about the other...

3
00:00:08,169 --> 00:00:11,779
Oh, madam, madam, say something!

4
00:00:11,779 --> 00:00:15,980
Andrew, my darling son, it's your birthday today.

5
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:20,219
And my wish for you is for you to get rid of that filthy husbandy husbandy husbandy.

6
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:25,699
Is that so? You abandoned me and my father when I was a teenager.

7
00:00:25,699 --> 00:00:31,539
And then when he died, he manipulated me and grandmother to grab more of the estate.

8
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:34,850
Don't you ever mess with my life again?

9
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:39,259
And besides, Frank is my assistant.

10
00:00:39,259 --> 00:00:44,009
So if you mess with him, you'll have to pay for it.

11
00:00:44,009 --> 00:00:47,880
Andrew.

12
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,320
Madam, Frank's gone.

13
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,679
I don't think that Andrew knows the truth yet, so we don't have much time.

14
00:00:52,679 --> 00:01:09,299
No worries, madam. I've already arranged everything.

15
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:11,079
Frank, get me a drink.

16
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:14,920
Now, are you deaf?

17
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,079
You gave you the right to order me around.

18
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:19,480
You're an assistant, that's your job.

19
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,519
Don't make me repeat myself or I'll have you running from the city in a minute.

20
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:25,599
Yet another person who wants me to leave the city.

21
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:29,640
First of all, I'm Andrew's personal assistant, not yours.

22
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,239
Second, I work for Crown Group.

23
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:36,079
So if you want to get me orders, maybe get a job at our company first.

24
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,319
Is that so?

25
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:42,700
Seems you don't really care about your grandmother.

26
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:49,209
Nasty people like you will get the karma eventually.

27
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:50,969
What's your language, you low-life?

28
00:01:50,969 --> 00:01:51,969
Hey!
