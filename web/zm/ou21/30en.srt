1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,339
What's the language in low life?

2
00:00:02,339 --> 00:00:03,339
Hey!

3
00:00:03,339 --> 00:00:05,459
What do you think you are?

4
00:00:05,459 --> 00:00:07,459
Frank is my guest.

5
00:00:07,459 --> 00:00:09,460
So if there's anyone who's extra here, that's you.

6
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:14,220
You won't regret this.

7
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:24,859
Is there something you need to tell me?

8
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:35,100
I can't tell him that his mother is using my grandmother's safety as leverage.

9
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,100
I should go check on the other guests.

10
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:47,420
Frank, do you really think that there's not a chance between us?

11
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:50,240
No.

12
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,880
Maybe I'm just not cut out for love.

13
00:00:52,880 --> 00:01:06,819
Maybe it's time to give up on this pursuit completely.

14
00:01:06,819 --> 00:01:10,400
Frank, we're together in this game.

15
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,680
We will have our cards, so we've finished it.

16
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,680
Let's move to our respective rooms.

17
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:26,159
Um, you go first and we'll follow.

18
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,159
I don't get it. Do you want to be with Frank or not?
