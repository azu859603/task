1
00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.089
You know, aphrodisiac.

2
00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:07.980
You smell that in the room?

3
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.269
I thought it was the air freshener.

4
00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:13.269
Wait, do you think someone sprayed an aphrodisiac before we came there?

5
00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:15.529
You think it was me?

6
00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:17.530
No, I know it wasn't you.

7
00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:19.530
Then who do you think it was?

8
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:20.530
I think it was Alan.

9
00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:23.530
I bet he's working with your mother to try and catch me.

10
00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:28.550
I guess they didn't expect you and Cruz to switch roles.

11
00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.550
I guess the cards weren't randomly assigned either then.

12
00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.159
Or Frank, I promise I'll make them pay for this.

13
00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:36.159
I'm so happy I swapped roles with Cruz.

14
00:00:36.159 --> 00:00:38.189
I don't feel well.

15
00:00:38.189 --> 00:01:03.460
Frank, we're losing our minds.

16
00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.459
Let's just stop looking at each other, okay?

17
00:01:06.459 --> 00:01:08.489
Or we'll get too hot.

18
00:01:08.489 --> 00:01:16.849
So, boss, no, Andrew, I'm in control of being in love with you since the day we met.

19
00:01:16.849 --> 00:01:18.849
From the very first day.

20
00:01:18.849 --> 00:01:21.849
I wasn't afraid to admit it, sorry.

21
00:01:21.849 --> 00:01:23.980
I forced myself to neglect these fees.

22
00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.980
I was a bit of an asshole then.

23
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.650
But you've changed. I can see it. I can feel it.

24
00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:31.650
I love you.

25
00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.650
And I don't know how you feel because you're always so cold.

26
00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.650
I will tell you something.

27
00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:36.739
So what?

28
00:01:36.739 --> 00:01:40.739
Even if you're teasing me, I still love you. I still love you.

29
00:01:40.739 --> 00:01:42.739
I still love you.

30
00:01:42.739 --> 00:01:46.180
I mean it.

31
00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.599
Try not to think about you, but I just can't.

32
00:01:49.599 --> 00:02:01.579
Now I get what you meant, Frank.

33
00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:03.579
Sex is best when two people are in love.

34
00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:07.579
Because a physical connection is never fulfilling without an emotional bond.

35
00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:31.719
And Andrew.

36
00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:39.379
Go call a doctor, Frank.

37
00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:41.449
I'll get a little attention quick.

38
00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:42.449
You get out of here.

39
00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:43.449
Oh, get out, get out.

40
00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:53.479
Where's Andrew?

41
00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:55.659
Is he okay?

42
00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:57.020
He's fine.

43
00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:02.219
I'm here to help you.

44
00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:05.340
After yesterday, I can no longer hide my true feelings for him.

45
00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:17.129
I need to finalise the divorce as soon as possible so we can start our real relationship.

46
00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:19.639
What are you guys doing here?

47
00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:25.930
Frank, I wanted to tell you that what happened yesterday between you and Andrew means nothing to him.

48
00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.879
Peter, tell him.

49
00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:34.629
Sir, I'd like his sexy body.

50
00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:36.729
I'll do anything to get him.

51
00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:39.729
I think that challenge will further prove my skills and seduction.

52
00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:41.729
And what about after you get him?

53
00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:43.729
Of course I'll get bored and move on quickly.

54
00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:45.729
I'm not going to let anyone trap me.

55
00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:49.789
Frank, I recommended you for the position of assistant to Andrew.

56
00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:54.789
But it was he who instructed me to find someone in the company for him to play around.

57
00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:56.789
He would just another pray for him.

58
00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:59.789
Also, Andrew's been delaying the divorce procedures.

59
00:03:59.789 --> 00:04:02.210
Yesterday was just a game.

60
00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:05.620
You're just a jerk who keeps destroying marriages.

61
00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.699
So I've been lied to all along.

62
00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:14.270
These people, this place, this city.

63
00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:15.939
It's not for me.

64
00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:18.939
And go back home to your village.

65
00:04:18.939 --> 00:04:29.680
Sir, your mother has left the country, her associates have been detained and Frank is now safe.

66
00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.680
Frank, we can finally be together.

67
00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:42.000
Worse, Frank?

68
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.100
Oh, Frank said he had to leave early.

69
00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.100
I'll have to, finally.

70
00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:51.259
Wait, he asked me to tell you to forget about what happened yesterday.

71
00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:54.509
Andrew, but it's still married.

72
00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:55.959
It's about it.

73
00:04:55.959 --> 00:04:56.959
Forget about it.

74
00:04:56.959 --> 00:04:57.959
How could I?

75
00:04:57.959 --> 00:04:59.959
You know, something's clearly been bothering him.

76
00:04:59.959 --> 00:05:02.699
I wonder if it's about the divorce.

77
00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:05.079
Tell the court to speed up the proceedings.

78
00:05:05.079 --> 00:05:06.079
Yes, son.

79
00:05:06.079 --> 00:05:17.040
The ring has been rescheduled.

80
00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.040
So you get the court at 3pm.

81
00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.040
Turn up.

82
00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.800
Is everything all right?

83
00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.379
My divorce will be finalised tomorrow.

84
00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:26.699
I'll be single, sir.

85
00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:27.699
Well, that's great news.

86
00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:29.699
We should celebrate tonight.

87
00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:31.699
We should be celebrating your marriage.

88
00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:35.050
My career in love like recently had been failures.

89
00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:37.050
Don't be discouraged.

90
00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.079
I think love is definitely out there for you.

91
00:05:40.079 --> 00:05:42.269
Yeah, like your sexy body.

92
00:05:42.269 --> 00:05:43.269
Don't imagine him again.

93
00:05:43.269 --> 00:05:44.269
Come on.

94
00:05:44.269 --> 00:05:45.399
I just want to drink tonight.

95
00:05:45.399 --> 00:05:47.399
Let's get wasting.

96
00:05:47.399 --> 00:05:49.389
Cheers.

97
00:05:49.389 --> 00:06:01.629
It's hospitalised.

98
00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:03.110
Don't it?

99
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:04.110
Hospitalised.

100
00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:06.339
But you're calling for my local number.

101
00:06:06.339 --> 00:06:08.339
Does that mean she's close?

102
00:06:08.339 --> 00:06:09.430
Yes.

103
00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:13.970
Okay, I'll be there as quickly as I can.

104
00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:19.560
Oh, I'm going to get the hospital.

105
00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.910
Wow, you're a gal, too.

106
00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:33.889
Grandmother.

107
00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:39.899
Isn't your husband here with you?

108
00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:42.220
Let's just not talk about him right now.

109
00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:46.220
I'm sorry I didn't call to let you know I was coming.

110
00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:48.220
I just wanted to surprise you both.

111
00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:52.910
Sorry, my grandmother is sick and wants to see you.

112
00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:55.910
Can you come to the hospital and pretend we're happy?

113
00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:57.040
I promised.

114
00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.040
I'll divorce you after.

115
00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:02.250
Don't worry.

116
00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:03.250
I'll see her.

117
00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:04.250
But I don't want to see you.

118
00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:07.649
Evening, ma'am.

119
00:07:07.649 --> 00:07:12.310
You must be with him.

120
00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:15.310
I'm so glad you found the time to visit.

121
00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:17.310
I really appreciate it.

122
00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:19.310
Well, family's all about supporting each other, isn't it?

123
00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:21.470
Have you had a fight?

124
00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:26.870
Let's just say that we had a slight disagreement.

125
00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:29.420
Tell me the truth.

126
00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:34.689
You're not really getting along, are you?

127
00:07:34.689 --> 00:07:37.689
I don't think she needs to know that her grandson has been having an affair.

128
00:07:37.689 --> 00:07:40.870
Take a rest, ma'am.

129
00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:42.870
I'll be back to see you soon.

130
00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:50.879
William, tell me you're not divorced, are you?

131
00:07:50.879 --> 00:07:53.139
I don't want to lie.

132
00:07:53.139 --> 00:07:55.139
We've signed the papers, so...

133
00:07:55.139 --> 00:07:58.420
No chance of staying together.

134
00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:00.420
We never were a good match.

135
00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:02.420
We're just married to fulfill our grandmother's wishes.

136
00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:05.420
And Frank and I have both found someone that we truly love.

137
00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:08.680
Thank you for being so honest with me.

138
00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:11.680
Just don't tell Frank how I already know.

139
00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:12.680
I want.

140
00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:20.339
Thanks for visiting my grandmother.

141
00:08:20.339 --> 00:08:22.819
She told me she was happy to see you.

142
00:08:22.819 --> 00:08:23.819
You're welcome.

143
00:08:23.819 --> 00:08:25.819
But don't go back on your word.

144
00:08:25.819 --> 00:08:28.110
We're getting a divorce soon.

145
00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:35.059
Of course.

146
00:08:39.129 --> 00:08:41.480
Frank, why is he here?

147
00:08:48.139 --> 00:08:51.139
You mean to tell me that the guy on the bench there is my husband?

148
00:08:51.139 --> 00:08:58.779
I know they had the same names, but I just assumed...

149
00:09:05.179 --> 00:09:06.269
Will it?

150
00:09:06.269 --> 00:09:07.269
I'm already here.

151
00:09:07.269 --> 00:09:09.230
It's him.

152
00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:11.519
Thanks, my husband.

153
00:09:11.519 --> 00:09:13.519
He made sure about what makes him be...

154
00:09:13.519 --> 00:09:15.519
You weren't your child, you bullet.

155
00:09:15.519 --> 00:09:17.519
Yeah, I don't want it to divorce.

156
00:09:17.519 --> 00:09:19.840
Yeah, go count as well now.

157
00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:21.840
Since the time's on, you tell me you're up.

158
00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:23.840
Just tell him I've changed my mind?

159
00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:24.840
No!

160
00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:27.090
Why?

161
00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:28.220
Where's Will it?

162
00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:32.220
Well, your husband just said he no longer wants a divorce.

163
00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:35.220
Sorry, what?

164
00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:40.149
Reaction.

165
00:09:40.149 --> 00:09:44.149
But last time we texted, he was very serious about it.

166
00:09:44.149 --> 00:09:52.100
This is his credit card.

167
00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:54.100
I was going to give it back off the divorce.

168
00:09:54.100 --> 00:10:02.059
Can you look concerned?

169
00:10:02.059 --> 00:10:05.279
Thinking about how to ensure that he never divorces me.

170
00:10:05.279 --> 00:10:15.379
Grandmother, I need your help.

171
00:10:15.379 --> 00:10:18.090
It's about my happiness.

172
00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:27.059
Are we at the wedding party?

173
00:10:27.059 --> 00:10:29.059
We could be.

174
00:10:29.059 --> 00:10:30.059
Be honest.

175
00:10:30.059 --> 00:10:33.059
You intentionally made me wear the same outfit I wore when I married.

176
00:10:33.059 --> 00:10:34.059
Will it?

177
00:10:34.059 --> 00:10:35.320
Will it?

178
00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:41.990
Are you trying to find me another husband?

179
00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:42.990
Take it.

180
00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:46.299
After all, you're my husband.

181
00:10:46.299 --> 00:10:47.779
Legally.

182
00:10:47.779 --> 00:10:55.480
You're my husband.

183
00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:57.919
There's no way.

184
00:10:57.919 --> 00:11:00.779
Nice to meet you again.

185
00:11:00.779 --> 00:11:04.820
Sorry that it took me so long to realize that it was you that I married.

186
00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:08.450
Why does he look so familiar?

187
00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:11.820
Angel.

188
00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:13.820
Are you really my husband, Will it?

189
00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:16.820
I'm both, but William's such a boring name, so I use my middle one.

190
00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:17.820
And...

191
00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:21.820
You know, I was so jealous of your husband until I realized that he was actually me.

192
00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:22.820
Bingo.

193
00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:26.820
He's the guy that showed up with your house asking for you when you outside getting the bottle of wine.

194
00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:29.139
Who could have thought?

195
00:11:29.139 --> 00:11:30.139
No, no.

196
00:11:30.139 --> 00:11:31.139
I don't believe this.

197
00:11:31.139 --> 00:11:32.139
Right.

198
00:11:32.139 --> 00:11:33.139
Listen.

199
00:11:33.139 --> 00:11:36.340
I know I haven't been good at getting to know you as my husband.

200
00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:38.750
But I want to make a mess.

201
00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:39.750
Will you forgive me?

202
00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:44.519
I mean, if I was your husband, I would forgive you for anything.

203
00:11:44.519 --> 00:11:50.659
You told everyone your husband cheated on you with no proof.

204
00:11:50.659 --> 00:11:54.139
You know it was a misunderstanding, but it still hurt me.

205
00:11:54.139 --> 00:11:55.779
That was my fault.

206
00:11:57.330 --> 00:11:59.779
I shouldn't have blown things out of proportion.

207
00:11:59.779 --> 00:12:01.779
But I'm sorry and I want to make things right.

208
00:12:01.779 --> 00:12:05.860
Our marriage has always been an arrangement.

209
00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:06.860
So what's changed?

210
00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:09.860
Do you really love me or is it more fun now to play the game with?

211
00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:10.860
Of course I love you.

212
00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:14.059
I want you to stay my husband for real.

213
00:12:14.059 --> 00:12:17.429
I don't believe you.

214
00:12:17.429 --> 00:12:19.429
You can give me one last chance to make things right.

215
00:12:19.429 --> 00:12:31.490
You can give me one last chance to make things right.

216
00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:33.490
I'm very disappointed in you Peter.

217
00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:36.809
You've been with me the longest and you've betrayed my trust.

218
00:12:36.809 --> 00:12:38.809
Here's your chance to tell the truth.

219
00:12:38.809 --> 00:12:44.440
Frank, I'm really sorry, but that recording mistake.

220
00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:48.519
But why would you lie to me?

221
00:12:48.519 --> 00:12:52.519
Well, recently I failed at stop trading and got into a lot of debt.

222
00:12:52.519 --> 00:12:57.830
Alan said he would help if I could break him too up.

223
00:12:57.830 --> 00:12:58.830
Taken away.

224
00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:10.139
Frank, I'll admit that when we first met, I just wanted to get into bed with you.

225
00:13:10.139 --> 00:13:16.059
But the more time we spent together, the more I started to fall in love with you.

226
00:13:16.059 --> 00:13:21.090
You know, I never really believed in love because of my parents' failed marriage.

227
00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:31.090
But everything's different now.

228
00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:34.090
Frank, you can reject me as many times as you want,

229
00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:40.350
but I'm only going to keep trying to win your heart.

230
00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:43.480
Well, it may take some time for me to forgive you.

231
00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:50.299
But I have to admit, I do love you.

232
00:13:50.299 --> 00:13:53.299
My husband, boss, play your boy.

233
00:13:53.299 --> 00:13:55.299
I'm so happy that you're my husband.

234
00:13:55.299 --> 00:14:03.179
So good now.
