00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.649
Edward, you're marrying a stripper?

2
00:00:02.649 --> 00:00:04.849
I thought I was your fiancÃ©.

3
00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:06.849
My father arranged for us to get married

4
00:00:06.849 --> 00:00:09.050
only for the sake of our families.

5
00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:11.050
We wouldn't be happy even if we did get married.

6
00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:13.050
But I would be happy, Edward.

7
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.710
Carla, you know I have someone that I love.

8
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.629
She's the one I'm waiting for.

9
00:00:20.629 --> 00:00:22.629
I don't know who the fuck you are,

10
00:00:22.629 --> 00:00:24.629
but if you think you have a chance against me,

11
00:00:24.629 --> 00:00:26.629
you're done with that, I thought.

12
00:00:26.629 --> 00:00:29.199
Miss, get it straight.

13
00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:31.199
I'm not competing with you.

14
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.399
Stop it.

15
00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:37.399
Edward, are you defending her now?

16
00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:40.520
I'm not dumb, bitch.

17
00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.759
I'm just waiting.

18
00:00:42.759 --> 00:00:43.759
Wow.

19
00:00:43.759 --> 00:00:45.259
Got a lot of admirers, huh?

20
00:00:45.259 --> 00:00:47.759
Any more than to watch out for?

21
00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:49.759
Look, if you see me in the living room,

22
00:00:49.759 --> 00:00:52.020
don't show your face.

23
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.020
Same will go for me.

24
00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.520
Your house, your rules.

25
00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:55.520
Big deal!
