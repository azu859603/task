Hi, I'm Velma. I've worked a lot of odd jobs in the city,

2
00:00:10,029 --> 00:00:12,769
waitressing,

3
00:00:12,769 --> 00:00:14,769
working in nightclubs,

4
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:17,800
all for a chance to act.

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:35,039
I'm also looking for someone. I hope that one day he sees me on screen.

6
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:41,049
That way he knows that I'm still here.

7
00:00:54,929 --> 00:01:13,150
That's okay, Sarah.

8
00:01:13,819 --> 00:01:16,140
Velma doesn't need to die with me.

9
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,140
Bring my food to my room and I'll eat there.

10
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,980
Yes. It's fine.

11
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,980
I usually don't eat with people anyway.

12
00:01:24,489 --> 00:01:27,739
By the way, I'm going out for a bit today.

13
00:01:27,739 --> 00:01:31,340
Where you go is not a my concern.

14
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:37,739
Fine. Is he always this big of a jerk?

15
00:01:37,739 --> 00:01:40,739
Excuse me, ma'am. He's just used to living alone.

16
00:01:40,739 --> 00:01:45,150
I'm sorry, Sarah. He must be difficult dealing with him every day.

17
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:52,870
It's okay.

18
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:54,870
I'll be right there.
