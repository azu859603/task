00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:15.750
Okay, sit. So. I heard a funny little rumor that you married the famous billionaire Edward

2
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.910
Arduin. It's a truth. I didn't know that he was a billionaire until after we were married.

3
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:27.890
You're joking. How did you manage that?

4
00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.210
Well, who cares? What are you waiting for? Seal the deal.

5
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.810
I don't know that I can't think about anyone but Algar.

6
00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:38.640
T, it's been ten years since you two escaped the orphanage.

7
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.880
Do we know if Algar could be anywhere? He could be dead.

8
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.399
He's one dead!

9
00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:48.240
Okay, um, I'm sorry. So, what's your plan?

10
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:56.899
Keep things the way they are, I guess, except now I can focus more on acting and not dancing in strip clubs.

11
00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:01.539
Hey! That's exciting, right? That's something you've always wanted to do since you were a kid.

12
00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:03.060
Is that audition today?

13
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:10.879
Yes.

14
00:01:10.879 --> 00:01:14.609
Hi, I'm here for the audition.

15
00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:17.969
You think you could just show up like that, you slut?
