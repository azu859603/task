1
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,960
We'll need your names once we're out of here, right?

2
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,150
Yeah, we're starting a new life.

3
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:14,150
I'll be...

4
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:16,149
Tama, what about you?

5
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:21,109
Algar, Helen, where are you?

6
00:00:21,109 --> 00:00:23,559
We have to run quick.

7
00:00:23,559 --> 00:00:25,559
Trying to escape again?

8
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:27,559
I warned you it's not gonna work.

9
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:30,559
Looks like I gotta give you some real punishment.

10
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:31,690
You go first.

11
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:33,689
At least one of us needs to escape.

12
00:00:33,689 --> 00:00:35,689
No, you go.

13
00:00:35,689 --> 00:00:36,689
She's gonna kill you.

14
00:00:36,689 --> 00:00:38,689
I won't let her catch me.

15
00:00:38,689 --> 00:00:39,689
Just go and find you.

16
00:00:39,689 --> 00:00:42,689
Let's meet at the amusement park.

17
00:00:42,689 --> 00:00:47,759
Oh, wait for you, Algar.

18
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:54,049
You're not going anywhere.

19
00:00:54,049 --> 00:00:56,049
I'll bring her back.

20
00:00:56,049 --> 00:00:57,049
Rest assured.

21
00:00:57,049 --> 00:00:59,049
After I'm done with you.
