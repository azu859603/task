1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,719
Oh, wait for you, Olga.

2
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:15,039
That happened.

3
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:18,039
Nothing to worry about. Just some issues with the film crew.

4
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:21,460
Why are you being so nice to me?

5
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:22,550
No reason.

6
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:25,160
Here. Take this card.

7
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,670
It's unlimited. Spend it however you want.

8
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:33,780
Why are you doing this? I don't want your money.

9
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:38,780
Well, if you need money, just let me know, and you can stop looking for odd jobs.

10
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:46,039
Odd jobs? Acting is my dream.

11
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:53,649
I danced in strip clubs for a living, but people like you born from a silver spoon wouldn't understand that.

12
00:00:53,649 --> 00:00:56,700
Then stop doing it.

13
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,700
We're in a contract marriage, right?

14
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:02,829
I won't interfere with your life, and you can't meddle in mine.

15
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:07,560
Acting is something that I've always wanted.

16
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:14,579
And besides, I'm not going to take your money besides the number that we agreed on.

17
00:01:14,579 --> 00:01:19,459
You need to rest now.

18
00:01:19,459 --> 00:01:20,459
Do you mind?
