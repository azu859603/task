00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.299
Who is she?

2
00:00:02.299 --> 00:00:03.299
Nobody.

3
00:00:03.299 --> 00:00:06.299
She's not here for the audition, too, is she?

4
00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.300
Well, in that case, more in for a treat.

5
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.300
LAUGHTER

6
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.500
Karla, Jenny, you're up next.

7
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:38.460
I can't believe it!

8
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.549
That's right.

9
00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:41.549
I never thought you'd find me.

10
00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:43.549
But it must come to an end.

11
00:00:43.549 --> 00:01:01.899
Cut!

12
00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:02.899
I'm sorry.

13
00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:05.900
Were you shot or did someone just step on your toe?

14
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.540
No.

15
00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:08.540
Okay, just try again.

16
00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.540
I was just a bit nervous.

17
00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.540
Miss Jennings, we are making a thriller with the tragic ending.

18
00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.540
What you just did was borderline comedy.

19
00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.700
Excuse me?

20
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:25.060
Do you know how close I am with your investor?

21
00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.099
If he was indeed recommended for the role,

22
00:01:28.099 --> 00:01:30.099
may we give her another chance?
