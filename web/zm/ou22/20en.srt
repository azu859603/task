00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:02,750
Why did you bring me here then?

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:05,309
Well, it was actually his idea.

3
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:09,470
Hello.

4
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:12,320
Hi, is this Jean?

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:12,880
Who is this?

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:14,720
This is Edward Arduin.

7
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,519
I recently invested in a film project

8
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:19,120
that I want you to take your friend, Thelma.

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,079
I think she'll be great for a lead role.

10
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:24,320
Wait, wait, you're Edward Arduin?

11
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:26,640
I wired the payment to your account.

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,440
Thank you.

13
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,160
Oh, wait, wait!

14
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:36,000
Oh, I still can't believe I spoke to a legendary Edward Arduin.

15
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,710
I can't believe you knew all this time and you didn't tell me.

16
00:00:40,509 --> 00:00:41,549
Don't look at me.

17
00:00:41,549 --> 00:00:44,270
I'm just the middle man doing somebody else a favor, okay?

18
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:45,869
And you still have to believe.

19
00:00:46,429 --> 00:00:52,479
You know, a lot of people say that Edward's not very nice.

20
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:53,920
He's like a stone cold man.

21
00:00:54,579 --> 00:00:55,939
Why is he being so good to you?

22
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,100
Yeah, I don't get it either.

23
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,740
I mean, women must be throwing themselves at him.

24
00:01:03,009 --> 00:01:03,649
Why?

25
00:01:03,649 --> 00:01:04,689
What do you help?
