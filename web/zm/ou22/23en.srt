1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:07,169
Well, you won't take my money, and I can't allow the wife of Edward Artoan to just work

2
00:00:07,169 --> 00:00:09,230
a regular job.

3
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:12,679
Oh, okay, so that's why.

4
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:16,440
Our all-rich people listen to what they're saying.

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,440
What was it?

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,440
Nothing.

7
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,440
This is great.

8
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:27,160
You know, you can be real sweet sometimes.

9
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,160
This is delicious.

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,890
I'm glad you like it.

11
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:33,890
Sweet pea.

12
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:37,539
Good morning, man.

13
00:00:37,539 --> 00:00:38,539
Good morning, man.

14
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:41,200
And what is left already?

15
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,200
Thank you.

16
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,990
I saw you were cooking last night.

17
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:46,990
I watched through your tinsel.

18
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:48,549
Uh, yeah.

19
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:49,549
It was Edward.

20
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,130
It is the cook.

21
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:52,130
It's Horton.

22
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:53,350
Gotta go.

23
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:54,350
I'm good.

24
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:57,619
What is going on?

25
00:00:57,619 --> 00:01:04,620
What are we waiting for?

26
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:06,260
Let's get started.

27
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:09,060
One of our lead roles is not here yet.

28
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,700
Ugh, no one thing.

29
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,500
I ask everyone here.

30
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,980
Is it should be?

31
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:17,980
Sorry, guys.

32
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:18,980
Traffic was nightmare.

33
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:19,980
All right.

34
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:20,980
I'm ready to start.

35
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:21,980
Wait.

36
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:24,980
I thought that she didn't get the part.

37
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:26,980
Well, how about that?

38
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:28,980
Looks like I'm gonna be playing here.

39
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:34,370
It's deep.

40
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:35,370
We'll see about that.

41
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:39,959
42 delta take two.

42
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:41,629
Ready.

43
00:01:41,629 --> 00:01:46,120
You have to leave now.

44
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,439
Not without the love of my life.

45
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:48,799
I'll wait for him no matter what.
