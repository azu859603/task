1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:03,100
But Thelma is the lead.

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:05,599
Yeah, that wouldn't make any sense.

3
00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:07,599
We can't make more changes to the script,

4
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:09,099
and we're already behind.

5
00:00:09,099 --> 00:00:11,140
Better get right to it then.

6
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:13,140
You don't have to do this for me.

7
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,140
I'm not doing it for you.

8
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,140
Doing it for my own investment.

9
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:26,329
All right, we have added a line to the script.

10
00:00:26,329 --> 00:00:32,329
So now, Thelma, Carla's new line will be your Cufus.

11
00:00:32,329 --> 00:00:34,329
Slap. Got it?

12
00:00:34,329 --> 00:00:38,549
All right, and... action.

13
00:00:38,549 --> 00:00:40,549
You have to leave now.

14
00:00:40,549 --> 00:00:42,549
Not without the love of my life.

15
00:00:42,549 --> 00:00:44,549
Oh, wait for him no matter what!

16
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:45,549
But what if he's dead?

17
00:00:45,549 --> 00:00:47,549
What if he finds somebody else?

18
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:49,549
He's just gonna spend the rest of your life

19
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,549
waiting for someone who will never come?

20
00:00:51,549 --> 00:00:59,710
Then I'll be sure to leave no room for regret.

21
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:03,460
Pot!

22
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:06,459
Oh, Bravo!

23
00:01:06,459 --> 00:01:08,459
That was perfect, Thelma!

24
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:11,459
You handled that perfectly.

25
00:01:11,459 --> 00:01:14,459
Alma, where are you next to the love of Carla after that line?

26
00:01:14,459 --> 00:01:16,459
Uh, no need for that.

27
00:01:16,459 --> 00:01:21,459
I think that my character is above that kind of pettiness.

28
00:01:21,459 --> 00:01:31,500
We'll expose you, Thelma.

29
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,500
Sooner or later.
