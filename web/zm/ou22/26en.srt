1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:06,740
Where are you, my little rock?

2
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:10,150
I'm doing fine.

3
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:11,150
Don't you worry.

4
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:15,460
You know it's bad to waste food.

5
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:17,460
Do you think you deserve to be punished?

6
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:18,460
Yes.

7
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:19,460
Headless to sight.

8
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:20,460
I do.

9
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,160
Helen's sick.

10
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,160
That's why she could have finished.

11
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,160
Isn't that sweet?

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,160
Too bad.

13
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,160
She's getting more punishment because of you.

14
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,160
Isn't that sweet?

15
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:35,159
Well, if you so insist, you can take it for her.

16
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:38,789
Oh, you're right.

17
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:53,340
Found the worker who leaked info to our competitor,

18
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,340
a manager who's worked with us for 20 years.

19
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,340
What do we do with him?

20
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:01,329
Fire them.

21
00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:03,780
So we need to.

22
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,129
Can't have disloyalty in the company.

23
00:01:06,129 --> 00:01:08,219
My room and his family.

24
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:10,219
So be it.

25
00:01:10,219 --> 00:01:12,379
All right.

26
00:01:12,379 --> 00:02:00,780
Helgar.
