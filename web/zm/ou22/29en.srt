1
00:00:03,089 --> 00:00:09,820
Could you maybe explain this you know how to better mature if I get it?

2
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:13,820
I mean, it is pretty straightforward. Just do what it says without improvising.

3
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:20,010
Well, not you. Oh, great yesterday.

4
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:25,010
I want to go over this one part. Now, when you say this line, I'm about.

5
00:00:26,489 --> 00:00:28,489
See who wins?

6
00:00:28,489 --> 00:00:31,550
What am I doing this afternoon?

7
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:36,549
Well, it's kind of a very important meaning. Did you forget?

8
00:00:36,549 --> 00:00:39,969
Castle, some of my apologies.

9
00:00:39,969 --> 00:00:41,259
What?

10
00:00:41,259 --> 00:00:45,060
So, what do you normally do when you're not working?

11
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:47,060
Uh, I do scriptees.

12
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:53,060
Oh, I was thinking more along the lines of going to the movies.

13
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:56,060
There's actually a good one out right now.

14
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:59,060
I mean, maybe if you're interested, we could try to catch it together.

15
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:03,060
I'm sorry, but I really need to focus on this job right now.

16
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,150
Oh, yeah, sure, sure.

17
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:09,629
You're a really interesting person to talk to, you know that?

18
00:01:10,629 --> 00:01:13,629
Edward, are you here to see me?

19
00:01:13,629 --> 00:01:16,180
Are you part of that?

20
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:19,579
Edward?

21
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,579
It's not for you. I'm sorry.

22
00:01:21,579 --> 00:01:23,579
Why is she still talking about you?

23
00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:26,760
Go put the steps in the lounge.

24
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,760
Got it, boss.

25
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:33,879
Edward?

26
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:36,170
What's your name again?

27
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:38,420
Actually, it doesn't matter.

28
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:42,420
What were you talking to my wife about?
