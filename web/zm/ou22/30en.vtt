00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:05.259
Oh, Summer, I... I had no idea that you were married.

2
00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:10.259
Um... Oh, don't worry about it, man. We were just talking about stuff in the script.

3
00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:11.259
Is that right?

4
00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:17.390
Hey, so you must be Edward Arduin. I've heard a lot about you. I'm Alex.

5
00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.390
Cool. Bye, Alex.

6
00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.390
Great. Yeah, um, I'll see you later, don't I?

7
00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:24.390
No, you won't.

8
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.390
Good, you guys are all here. Edward brought snacks. They're in the lounge if anyone wants them.

9
00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:30.390
Yes, I'll come.

10
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.390
What?

11
00:00:33.159 --> 00:00:34.219
Snacks.

12
00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:40.229
Edward, does it usually come to set this often?

13
00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:43.229
He's quite the busy man. I think he's here to see you.

14
00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:45.229
He's here to see Carla, not me.

15
00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:48.229
Oh, please. Can you not see the way he looks at you?

16
00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:52.780
Whatever. Oh, speak of the devil.

17
00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.780
I will give you two some privacy.

18
00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:56.780
No, don't.

19
00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:07.689
You're getting out of hand. Don't forget, I'm the one who hired you.

20
00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:08.689
Excuse me?

21
00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:10.689
Stay away from Alex. Got it?

22
00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:15.689
What are you talking about? There's nothing going on between us besides you came here to see Carla.

23
00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.819
Is he or Joss?

24
00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:23.819
No, what are you talking about? I'm not Joss.
