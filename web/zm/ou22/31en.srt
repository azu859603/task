1
00:00:03,089 --> 00:00:04,830
What are you doing?

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:06,870
Carla and I aren't together.

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:07,870
I'm here for you.

4
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:10,509
You really expect me to believe that.

5
00:00:10,509 --> 00:00:16,579
Don't worry.

6
00:00:16,579 --> 00:00:20,219
Yeah, girl?

7
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:28,000
What?

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,960
Gene, are you absolutely sure?

9
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:30,679
Yes.

10
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:31,559
Positive.

11
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:33,079
I used to know this guy from the streets,

12
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:35,759
and he and Elgar drifted around for months.

13
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:37,560
So where is he?

14
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:41,359
Well, they later got separated, so he has no idea after that.

15
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:44,820
But that's gotta mean that Elgar's still alive, right?

16
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,640
Oh my goodness.

17
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,600
Thank you so much.

18
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,439
You have no idea how much this means to me.

19
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:53,119
It's been 10 years.

20
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:55,520
Don't forget, you are married too.

21
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,469
What are you going to do?

22
00:00:57,469 --> 00:00:58,469
Oh, to force him.

23
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:02,340
Once our contract is up, I needed the money.

24
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,420
Elgar will understand.

25
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:05,420
I know.

26
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:08,780
Edward seemed really into you.

27
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:23,010
Actually, Gene, I think I should keep my distance from him.

28
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:24,349
You OK?

29
00:01:24,349 --> 00:01:28,900
Yeah.

30
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,310
Want to tell me what happened?

31
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:35,379
I just want to be alone for a bit, OK?

32
00:01:35,379 --> 00:01:37,700
Is this about Carla?

33
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,700
I told you I went to see you, not her.

34
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,260
Edward, I don't care who you're seeing.

35
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:47,829
We're only married on paper, right?

36
00:01:47,829 --> 00:01:50,180
Is this because we're moving too fast?
