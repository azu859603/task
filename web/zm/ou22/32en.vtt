Is this about Carla? I told you I went to see you, not her.

2
00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.669
Edward, I don't care if you're seeing. We're only married on paper, right?

3
00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:16.170
Is this because we're moving to...Famest?

4
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.480
I just think that we should keep our distance. Please.

5
00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:33.359
Thought she was playing hard to get, huh? Maybe she doesn't want to seem too eager.

6
00:00:33.359 --> 00:00:37.960
I mean, why would anyone project you? It's impossible.

7
00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:45.210
Kalan, let's get to the set.

8
00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.210
Nathan, you'll be wearing this dress for the next scene. Is that okay? That's fine.

9
00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.799
So you think you could just take whatever you want?
