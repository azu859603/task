1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,000
I thought this was my personal changing room, like it's always been.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,299
Carla, this room is for the lead role.

3
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:09,560
He wears his outside.

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:12,160
Well, actually, I'm all done here.

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,460
Carla loves taking things that aren't hers.

6
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:15,560
Be my guest.

7
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:18,960
Use it.

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,960
Aren't you quite generous then?

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:21,960
Mm-hmm.

10
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,359
Edward's not here, so you can drop the act.

11
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:28,359
We actually need to get back to work, if there's nothing else.

12
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:34,560
Actually, I can finish my makeup myself.

13
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:35,659
Go on.

14
00:00:35,659 --> 00:00:37,159
What do you want to talk about?

15
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:38,159
Let's make a deal.

16
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:39,159
A deal?

17
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:40,159
Hahaha.

18
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:44,920
What the fuck do you think you are?

19
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:52,189
Well, as far as I know, I'm Edward's wife.

20
00:00:52,189 --> 00:00:53,689
Kind of deal.

21
00:00:53,689 --> 00:00:55,090
Stop picking fights with me.

22
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:58,890
Stop giving me a hard time on set, and I won't take anything away from you.

23
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:05,260
I'll actually help you with whatever you and Edward have going on.

24
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,239
Alright, deal.

25
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:09,239
I'm done with this room, by the way.

26
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:11,299
It's yours if you still want it.

27
00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:12,299
I don't need your pity.

28
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:27,439
Don't you have, like, business to run?

29
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,439
What are you doing here all day?
