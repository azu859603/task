1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:03,669
But whatever games you're playing, you need to stop.

2
00:00:03,669 --> 00:00:05,070
What are you talking about?

3
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:07,570
You came here to see Carlo, right?

4
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:09,419
Now I'm gonna come on.

5
00:00:09,419 --> 00:00:12,419
Edward, we're going to be divorced really soon.

6
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:13,419
So?

7
00:00:13,419 --> 00:00:15,919
So if you're attracted to somebody, then go for it!

8
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:16,920
I want you to be happy!

9
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:23,420
The only person I love is you!

10
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,420
Edward, how could you?

11
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:29,679
Everything I do for you, Carlo.

12
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,679
I do for your father.

13
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,679
He looked out for me, so this is me, hanging back.

14
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:45,600
I'm already in love with somebody else.

15
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,600
It's never gonna be you.

16
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,100
But if that man didn't exist, would you consider me?

17
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,600
Stop it, Edward. It's never going to happen!

18
00:00:53,600 --> 00:01:00,969
What do I do, Algar?

19
00:01:00,969 --> 00:01:03,359
I know you're out there.

20
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,359
What do I do?
