1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,529
I did whatever it took to gain my father's approval, to secure my inheritance, my methods were ruthless, my conscience, and Calus.

2
00:00:14,529 --> 00:00:17,489
You did what you had to do.

3
00:00:17,489 --> 00:00:23,420
I'm a different man, a monster, she doesn't even recognize.

4
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:30,300
If she finds out this is the man she's been looking for all these years, it'll drive her away.

5
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,300
I can't lose her again.

6
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:35,859
So it was true?

7
00:00:35,859 --> 00:00:52,140
Arcon and I, we roamed the city for a winter, and a lot of people say he made some enemies.

8
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:58,429
One night, under the bridge where we slept, he got stabbed, and he died.

9
00:00:58,429 --> 00:01:02,780
No, you're mistaken.

10
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:04,939
He always had a ring with him.

11
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:05,939
It was a nice ring.

12
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:11,900
I think he had the letters A and H on it.

13
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:17,019
I told him he could pawn it for a few bucks, but he just kept it with him.

14
00:01:17,019 --> 00:01:23,299
He can't just be gone. He can't just be gone.

15
00:01:23,299 --> 00:01:24,299
It's okay.
