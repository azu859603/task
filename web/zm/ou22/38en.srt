1
00:00:01,139 --> 00:00:05,139
Oh, Fama!

2
00:00:05,139 --> 00:00:07,139
Sweetie, what's wrong?

3
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:11,140
Oh my God, maybe you have an England three days.

4
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:13,140
Can I get you something?

5
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,169
Anything?

6
00:00:15,169 --> 00:00:17,170
It's not good for you.

7
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:25,280
This is my fault.

8
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:28,460
She's burning up.

9
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:32,460
The doctor said it was from emotional distress and not eating.

10
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,579
Go make her something white.

11
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:37,579
I'll stay with her.

12
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:40,030
Yes.

13
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:47,899
You need to get some rest and let me handle this.

14
00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:51,310
No, it's okay. Leave it to me.

15
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:53,310
Look, I know you care.

16
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:55,570
I've never seen you do this for anymore.

17
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:59,570
And if the old lady were here, she'd be heartbroken.

18
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:01,570
To see you this exhausted.

19
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:03,570
Don't worry about me, Sarah.

20
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:04,569
You can go now.

21
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:17,859
Agree?

22
00:01:17,859 --> 00:01:22,420
Please eat and get better.
