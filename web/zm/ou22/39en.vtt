00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:08.429
Are you okay? I'm trying to call you for ten times.

2
00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.429
You haven't done something to do but have you.

3
00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.619
I can't find your reason to go.

4
00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:19.010
Stop saying that, okay? Don't listen to what that guy said.

5
00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.010
He doesn't know what he's talking about.

6
00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.010
We never found Algar's body. Maybe he's to a life.

7
00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:30.679
You've waited ten years, okay? You sure you're going to give up now?

8
00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:33.810
Don't you want to find out the truth for yourself?

9
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:39.179
Yeah, if you're right, I should keep going.

10
00:00:39.179 --> 00:00:43.280
Good. Now go get some sleep and get back to set, girl.

11
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.280
Okay, that is something that you've always wanted and you're not going to screw them, alright?

12
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:54.969
Yeah. I understand. I'll keep going for Algar.

13
00:00:54.969 --> 00:01:01.329
I want that bitch, dad. You got that thing ready?

14
00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:05.019
Sure, I would do the job.
