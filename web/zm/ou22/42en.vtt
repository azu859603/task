00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.620
What are you doing? That's not funny. I was worried sick. What's the matter with you?

2
00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.620
How else could I get such a lovely monologue?

3
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.619
Okay, you know what? I'm gonna go get a doctor.

4
00:00:09.619 --> 00:00:16.850
No, no. I'm fine. No. Look, not even a scratch. Just need a minute.

5
00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.850
Are you sure it seemed pretty serious?

6
00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.850
Yeah, the knife didn't even get to me. Something blocked it.

7
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.300
Really? Where is it?

8
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.300
Nothing. I'll find out what happened today.

9
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.710
Meanwhile, be more careful and sad, yeah?

10
00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.710
No, don't worry about it. You're the patient. Just rest up now.

11
00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.579
I heard everything you were saying, by the way.

12
00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:47.090
Okay, you know what? I'm really getting you a doctor now. Just shut up.

13
00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:59.649
Saved my life.

14
00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:05.340
How are you doing, boss?

15
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.560
Oh, not too shabby.

16
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.069
So, what do you plan to do with karma?

17
00:01:11.069 --> 00:01:15.500
Almost forgot.

18
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.060
Let's get paid back.

19
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.060
I'm not sure what we're gonna do after your little incident.

20
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.060
I'm sorry. I was thinking it won't happen again. I promise.

21
00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.060
Jay, get a replacement for her role. She's done.
