1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:01,810
Edward, what are you saying?

2
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:04,290
I told you to stop pulling these tricks behind my back.

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:06,129
I didn't do anything!

4
00:00:06,129 --> 00:00:08,529
Don't listen to her, she's making it all up!

5
00:00:08,529 --> 00:00:12,130
Carla had someone on the prop team switch the fake knife with a real one.

6
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:15,269
She almost killed Delma and myself.

7
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:18,230
Edward, I'm sorry, I messed up.

8
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:20,750
Please, please give me another chance.

9
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:23,870
I've given you plenty of chances.

10
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:28,280
Really, Edward, tears.

11
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,019
Please stop, please stop yourself.

12
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:34,280
He ate!

13
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,000
Doing all of this for a man, I hope it's worth it.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,420
Edward, you know everything we did, it's because I love you.

15
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:50,979
If you try her to hear again, you will be sorry.

16
00:00:50,979 --> 00:00:58,659
The hand rub is in place.

17
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:03,509
Well, now that that's over, we should talk about what you said to me earlier.

18
00:01:03,509 --> 00:01:04,989
Which is what?

19
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:10,549
That you were attracted to me.

20
00:01:10,549 --> 00:01:12,549
We're not gonna talk about that.

21
00:01:12,549 --> 00:01:14,310
That's not fair, you tricked me!
