00:00:01.679 --> 00:00:11.849
What if the person you're looking for is me?

2
00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.019
Don't be ridiculous.

3
00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:21.489
Besides, you come from a rich and powerful family.

4
00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:24.489
Then he's an orphan, like me.

5
00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:28.379
And he's incredibly kind.

6
00:00:28.379 --> 00:00:31.539
He wouldn't even step on an aunt.

7
00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:34.600
You can't say the same thing about you.

8
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.710
People can change.

9
00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.450
I'll never stop searching for him.

10
00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.450
I'm afraid that you can't stop me.

11
00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:52.429
Am I even worthy of love?
