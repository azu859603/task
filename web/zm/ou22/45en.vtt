00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:02.850
Am I even worthy of love?

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:09.009
You're a billionaire. I'm sure that there's plenty of women fighting over you.

3
00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:14.220
Plus, I stand by what I said.

4
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.559
I don't think that this Edward is the real you.

5
00:00:18.559 --> 00:00:22.219
Do you remember when we first met?

6
00:00:22.219 --> 00:00:24.929
You saved me.

7
00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:27.500
You're a good person.

8
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.789
You're kind to noss.

9
00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:30.789
To Sarah.

10
00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:34.939
You'll find the love that you deserve.

11
00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:47.000
He's gone.

12
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.420
He waited ten years and he's just gone.

13
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.810
Do you like the man I am now?

14
00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:02.899
It doesn't matter. We're getting divorced in here.

15
00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:09.060
If I give you all my properties and assets, can we not get a divorce?
