1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:10,650
You said something about money and assets, and then after that, not a thing.

2
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:18,109
Okay, back to work, come on.

3
00:00:18,109 --> 00:00:26,800
Can we talk?

4
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,570
I heard you've been looking for someone.

5
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:30,699
Yes.

6
00:00:30,699 --> 00:00:36,500
I believe this could be helpful.

7
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,619
This place is reopening soon.

8
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:44,159
I'd like for you to come.

9
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:47,159
What does this have to do with the man that I'm looking for?

10
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:48,479
You'll see.

11
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:52,979
Okay, I'll go.

12
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:56,170
I don't want to spoil the place.

13
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:58,520
What does this have to do with Edward?

14
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:06,409
Yes, I trusted you.

15
00:01:06,409 --> 00:01:08,409
Guys, we're blowing up.

16
00:01:08,409 --> 00:01:09,409
What do you mean?

17
00:01:09,409 --> 00:01:13,540
After we posted the behind the scenes, we went viral.

18
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,540
Selma became a sensation.

19
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,540
She's now trending number one, big star.

20
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,540
Trending, does this mean more money?

21
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:24,540
Of course it does, and that is just the easy part.

22
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:29,849
I was thinking about my next movie, and I want you.

23
00:01:29,849 --> 00:01:32,849
Wow, this is a dream come true.

24
00:01:32,849 --> 00:01:35,849
And we are having a rap party at the hottest bar tonight.

25
00:01:35,849 --> 00:01:36,849
All right.

26
00:01:36,849 --> 00:01:38,849
You'll wonder who's so generous.

27
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:39,849
Mm-hmm.

28
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:40,849
Mm-hmm.

29
00:01:40,849 --> 00:01:41,849
Mm-hmm.

30
00:01:41,849 --> 00:01:42,849
Okay.
