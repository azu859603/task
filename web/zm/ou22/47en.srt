00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Boss, I bought this new contract.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Do you think that I won't be surprised by the party I'm throwing for?

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,639
Oh, definitely.

4
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:11,640
So, should I pick her up or do I had a shot with the party?

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,640
You don't do this often, do you?

6
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:32,399
Great party, Edward.

7
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,420
You'd only be fitting, right?

8
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:39,119
Not entirely bad.

9
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:40,119
Thank you.

10
00:00:40,119 --> 00:00:43,500
How would you like to thank me?

11
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,500
Sorry, everybody, attention, attention.

12
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,500
Thank you, thank you.

13
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,750
First off, this has been an amazing three months.

14
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,750
I'd like to thank everybody in here.

15
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,869
Here is two.

16
00:00:57,869 --> 00:01:00,869
It's huge success.

17
00:01:00,869 --> 00:01:01,869
Cheers!

18
00:01:01,869 --> 00:01:02,869
Cheers!

19
00:01:02,869 --> 00:01:03,869
Mm-hmm.

20
00:01:03,869 --> 00:01:11,870
And now a few words from Edward, the man, the big boss, without him, none of this would be possible.

21
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:13,870
Thank you all so much.

22
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:17,870
I just want to say how grateful I am for the opportunity.

23
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:20,969
Jay is an exceptional director.

24
00:01:20,969 --> 00:01:23,969
He's casting remarkable.

25
00:01:23,969 --> 00:01:26,969
Thelma's performance, in particular, out of this world.

26
00:01:26,969 --> 00:01:32,969
And I'd like to take this moment to tell her that I'll always be there to support her.

27
00:01:32,969 --> 00:01:34,829
Cheers.

28
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:42,939
Stop it.

29
00:01:42,939 --> 00:01:45,939
By the way, do you think Algar will watch my new show?

30
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,939
Do you think it will recognize me?

31
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:54,180
This is really hard to hear, but you've got to let him go.

32
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,459
Algar's gone.

33
00:01:57,459 --> 00:02:00,459
I'm not giving up until I know for sure.
