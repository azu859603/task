00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.790
You quitting?

2
00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:18.269
What are you talking about?

3
00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:20.269
Production told me you turned down Jay's new project

4
00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:23.269
and you didn't show up for any of the promo events.

5
00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:26.269
What new project is this about? Who told you this?

6
00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:28.589
Oh. Oh no.

7
00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:31.780
Couldn't be Edward.

8
00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.770
Could it?

9
00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.179
Edward?

10
00:00:36.179 --> 00:00:41.340
So, he turned it down and he told everybody that I quit?

11
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.340
Maybe he thought it was for your own good?

12
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.659
Interfering with my career without telling me?

13
00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:48.659
How was that for my own good?

14
00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:57.070
Mr. Edward is in a meeting right after me? Help my plate.

15
00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:02.070
Oh, just gentlemen. Let's take a break. We'll continue this afternoon.

16
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:08.430
Did you turn down the offer for my new film?
