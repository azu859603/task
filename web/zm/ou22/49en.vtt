00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.780
Can I explain?

2
00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:03.980
This will terminate our contract marriage.

3
00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.549
The deal is over.

4
00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:07.849
What do you mean?

5
00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:10.810
I'll pay the penalty for breaching our contract.

6
00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:13.710
Once it's settled, I don't want you meddling in my life anymore.

7
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.810
You almost got hurt on set.

8
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:17.410
I was trying to protect you.

9
00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.809
God, I don't need your protection, okay?

10
00:00:19.809 --> 00:00:22.609
I can look out for myself. This is my life.

11
00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:25.789
You're making a big mistake here.

12
00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.789
You stay out of my work and my personal life, Edward.

13
00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:36.850
We're done.

14
00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.250
Hey, it's Thumba. Can I see you real quick?

15
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.840
Thumba.

16
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.039
You're very talented.

17
00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:49.240
It was such a shame to see you give up.

18
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.060
But I knew you had it in you from the start.

19
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.060
I saw it in you all the way.

20
00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.109
Thank you.

21
00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.700
Now I strictly get to make decisions for myself.

22
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.900
Now, let's see this next project.

23
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.260
Next project, next project.

24
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.859
Here.

25
00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:15.310
What do you think?

26
00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.099
Let's just say that it's a pleasure doing business with you, Jay.

27
00:01:20.099 --> 00:01:25.900
Relations.

28
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:26.900
Thank you.
