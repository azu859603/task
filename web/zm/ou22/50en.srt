1
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,160
Come on.

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:08,160
What are you doing?

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,160
Excuse me.

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:10,160
I'm perfectly calm.

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,160
How about we both compromise?

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,160
You continue with your acting as long as it's through our to win investments.

7
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,160
You still don't get it.

8
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,160
Do you?

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,160
I'm not your accessory.

10
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,160
I'm not a part of the art of the family.

11
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,160
Plus the only person I can make decisions for me is myself.

12
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,160
Can't we talk about it for the sake of our relationship?

13
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,179
Look.

14
00:00:32,179 --> 00:00:35,469
I'm thankful for everything you've done for me.

15
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:38,270
You've crossed the line.

16
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:40,460
To buy Edward.

17
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:45,409
Oh, gamma.

18
00:00:45,409 --> 00:00:50,409
Look, I have rarely seen Edward smile since his father passed away.

19
00:00:50,409 --> 00:00:53,409
And he's like a new man now that you're here.

20
00:00:53,409 --> 00:00:57,270
I'm sorry, but he's here.

21
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:00,939
It's okay, Sarah.

22
00:01:00,939 --> 00:01:02,380
Let her go.
