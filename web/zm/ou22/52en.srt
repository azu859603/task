1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:02,750
Mr. Arnold, you got a seven?

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:03,750
I don't.

3
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:13,230
So, Mr. Arnold, what brings you here, thinking of joining the entertainment industry?

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,230
You don't want to be here.

5
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:18,969
Sorry, I can't help you with that.

6
00:00:18,969 --> 00:00:22,969
So, this new film is a romantic drama with some comedy.

7
00:00:22,969 --> 00:00:24,969
When you're in J's and you're in J's.

8
00:00:24,969 --> 00:00:27,160
You ever want any meat?

9
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,160
Let's go!

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,160
No.

11
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,449
Not yet.

12
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:36,450
Ladies, I would love to thank our amazing director, J, for all of his amazing visions

13
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:39,450
and everyone else who's helped me on this incredible journey.

14
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:40,450
What?

15
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:42,450
I lost specifically.

16
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:48,090
And I'm so excited to get started because I know that this is going to be another hit.

17
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,090
Alright, ready to check out the set for the new movie?

18
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:52,090
I want you.

19
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:54,090
Actually, do you want to check it out together?

20
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,090
Sure.

21
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:57,939
Della.

22
00:00:57,939 --> 00:00:58,939
Della, Della.

23
00:00:58,939 --> 00:01:03,469
How do you win back a woman?

24
00:01:03,469 --> 00:01:05,469
Two hours?

25
00:01:05,469 --> 00:01:06,469
Who wins?

26
00:01:06,469 --> 00:01:08,469
Gifts are always a good movie.

27
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:10,760
How would you?

28
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,760
Let's get back to the other side.
