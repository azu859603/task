00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.529
I told you I'd meet you in your wallet.

2
00:00:02.529 --> 00:00:07.610
Alcor, but how?

3
00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:11.570
Why didn't you tell me after all this time?

4
00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.570
After I escaped the orphanage,

5
00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:15.570
I had mistress and people after me,

6
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.750
so I had to fake my own death.

7
00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.489
I survived, but the price was becoming a different man.

8
00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:32.509
Cold, ruthless, and I was so scared

9
00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.700
that if you found out this was the man I'd become,

10
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.060
you wouldn't love me anymore.

11
00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:42.060
Besides, the Arduin family erased every trace of my past.

12
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.659
If they find out you're the one I'm looking for,

13
00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:48.210
they'll use you against me.

14
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.689
Then I can't risk that.

15
00:00:50.689 --> 00:00:54.420
Alcor, you know that I love you.

16
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.700
You do?

17
00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:05.340
You buy my side, I'm not afraid of anything.

18
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.340
Then I want us to ever be a part again.
