1
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:30,910
Right, after 20 years, I'm finally here to marry you, Ellie, just as I promised.

2
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:41,039
Broke it!

3
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:48,000
The school's crazy, let's go!

4
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,179
Don't worry, superheroes always spend their way to stand up again.

5
00:00:53,179 --> 00:01:04,879
You're a lifesaver, Ellie.

6
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,879
You always take good care of me.

7
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:07,879
Because I like you.

8
00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:08,879
I like you too.

9
00:01:09,939 --> 00:01:12,939
And I want to take good care of you forever.

10
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:17,459
Will you marry me?

11
00:01:17,459 --> 00:01:23,299
In 20 years, we can meet at the First Encounter Bible Shop.

12
00:01:23,299 --> 00:01:24,299
Yes.

13
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:27,299
In 20 years, when we're grumps, I'll marry you.

14
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:30,299
Here, take this pocket, watch with my picture in it.

15
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:33,299
And I'll keep the one with your picture in it.

16
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:40,769
Ellie at the First Encounter Bible Shop.

17
00:01:40,769 --> 00:01:41,769
She is, sir.

18
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:43,769
An all necessary person, I'll have been cleared out.

19
00:01:43,769 --> 00:01:44,769
Excellent.

20
00:01:44,769 --> 00:01:45,769
Right this way.
