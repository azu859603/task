00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.720
Thank you for coming wedding dress shopping with me.

2
00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:03.879
Which one do you like better?

3
00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:04.719
Mine or yours?

4
00:00:04.719 --> 00:00:05.519
Oh, mine.

5
00:00:05.519 --> 00:00:07.879
I mean, it is the price of your one.

6
00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:09.759
Price isn't everything.

7
00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:12.400
It's about finding the right fit.

8
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.599
Are you really going to marry this guy

9
00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:17.519
just because of a promise you made as kids?

10
00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:20.280
I mean, you don't even remember what his name is

11
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.600
or what he looks like.

12
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.280
What if he's totally broke?

13
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.039
Even if he's broke.

14
00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:26.000
We'll figure it out.

15
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.839
Well, I can't see myself making a bunch of kids

16
00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:31.199
with a broke baby daddy.

17
00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.880
Just not the life for me.

18
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.880
My God, check this out.

19
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.840
Billionaire Clyde Croft drops $150 million

20
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.960
on a pink diamond necklace for his love.

21
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.270
God, I wonder who the lucky girl is.

22
00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.310
Pardon, I need to go to the restroom.

23
00:00:50.310 --> 00:01:05.219
Can you hold this for me?

24
00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:23.819
There she is with the watch, Ellie.

25
00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:27.260
You're the CEO of the Croft Corporation?

26
00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.379
Yeah, and I am here to marry you.
