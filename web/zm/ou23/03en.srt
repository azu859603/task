1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Mr. Croft, I... I'm not.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
There's no need to be so formal with each other.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,030
Come on, call me Clyde.

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:14,560
Clyde, I have been waiting 20 years for you.

5
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,559
You've turned into the man I thought you'd become.

6
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:20,559
Hey, I'm so sorry to keep you waiting for so long.

7
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:24,609
To our joyous reunion.

8
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:27,410
Hold it.

9
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:53,340
I love it.

10
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:59,539
Don't you gotta do $150 million.

11
00:00:59,539 --> 00:01:02,789
I got the jackpot.

12
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:05,019
Okay, yeah, I'll be right there.

13
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:09,439
Just hold on.

14
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:12,439
Ellie's changed so much in 20 years.

15
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:14,599
Hey, Ellie.

16
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:16,599
Something urgent came up.

17
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:17,599
I gotta take it.

18
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:19,599
Yeah, yeah, go do what you need to do.

19
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:20,659
Okay.

20
00:01:20,659 --> 00:01:21,659
Oh.

21
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:23,980
Hey.

22
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:24,980
Call me later.
