00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.270
At last. It's you.

2
00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.279
Miss, um...

3
00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:11.279
Yeah, don't even try. I'm not available.

4
00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:13.279
Try. With you.

5
00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:23.449
In your dreams, you narcissist.

6
00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:28.570
I must be out of my mind if I thought that guy could be my childhood sweetheart.

7
00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:29.570
Elise!

8
00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.109
There is something that you need to know.

9
00:00:33.109 --> 00:00:34.109
What's going on?

10
00:00:34.109 --> 00:00:36.109
Your childhood sweetheart?

11
00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:40.259
He sent a messenger.

12
00:00:40.259 --> 00:00:44.350
And he said that he can't keep his promise to marry you, because he's in love with somebody else.

13
00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.990
Did he leave a number, or...

14
00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:49.990
I feel like we should meet face to face.

15
00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:58.880
No. No. The messenger said that he wanted nothing to do with you, and he even took back the pocket watch he gave you.

16
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.710
I guess that promise only meant something to me.

17
00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.709
Sorry, Elise. I'm not turning down my chance to be filthy rich.

18
00:01:06.709 --> 00:01:10.709
Well, on the bright side, you're free from that stupid little promise, right?

19
00:01:10.709 --> 00:01:14.030
It was never stupid to me.

20
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.930
Eleanor, where did you get that necklace?
