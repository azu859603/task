00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.720
Eleanor, where did you get that necklace?

2
00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:06.059
It looks just like this one.

3
00:00:06.059 --> 00:00:09.619
Yeah, it's a replica from the bridal shop.

4
00:00:09.619 --> 00:00:11.820
I thought it looked nice, so I put it on.

5
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:12.820
Yeah.

6
00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:13.820
Right.

7
00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.859
When it's bridal shop, I have a $150 million necklace.

8
00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:17.859
Right.

9
00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:18.859
Oh.

10
00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:20.219
Hello.

11
00:00:20.219 --> 00:00:21.219
Craft Corporation?

12
00:00:21.219 --> 00:00:24.219
I got the job?

13
00:00:24.219 --> 00:00:25.219
Yeah.

14
00:00:25.219 --> 00:00:27.179
I can start today.

15
00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:31.089
Thank you.

16
00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:34.090
I got the job as Clyde Croft's new secretary.

17
00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:35.969
Mr. Croft's secretary?

18
00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.640
Yep.

19
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.159
My new boss is the big shot that just spent $150 million on a necklace for his love.

20
00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:44.920
Oh, I better change.

21
00:00:44.920 --> 00:01:00.060
Now that Elise got the job with Clyde, she's bound to find out that I took her spot.

22
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.130
Hi.

23
00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:02.130
I'm Elise.

24
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.290
I'm the new secretary starting today.

25
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.290
Oh.

26
00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:06.290
I'm Andy.

27
00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:07.290
Welcome aboard.

28
00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.060
I'm going to be helping me with Mr. Croft and his daily affairs.

29
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.099
I thought we agreed that I was going to be Mr. Croft's new secretary.

30
00:01:14.099 --> 00:01:18.870
You were unqualified.

31
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:19.870
Mr. Croft is here.

32
00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.120
Everybody's straighten up, please.

33
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.760
The last secretary got fired after crossing the line, so don't think that your pretty

34
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:38.180
face is going to get you very far with Mr. Croft.

35
00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:48.659
Afternoon, Mr. Croft.

36
00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.900
Are you trying to seduce your way into a promotion by throwing yourself all over Mr. Croft like

37
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:54.900
that?

38
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:55.900
Wow.

39
00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.060
Wait.

40
00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.060
You.

41
00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.060
I'm sorry.

42
00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.060
Mr. Croft.

43
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.780
This is the new secretary, Elise.

44
00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:02.780
Yeah.

45
00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.659
Hey, Ellie.

46
00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.520
Good heart.

47
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:16.800
I forgot to tell you that my best friend, Elise, just started working at your company.

48
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.960
Why is he staring at me like that?

49
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:19.960
She's your best friend.

50
00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.789
He's got a total copycat.

51
00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:28.229
She's always tried to take my stunts and she applied to work for you after I told

52
00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:29.229
her about us.

53
00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:31.939
Well, I'd keep my distance from her if I were you.

54
00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:32.939
Yeah.

55
00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:33.939
Don't worry.

56
00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:37.740
I won't allow someone like that in my company.

57
00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:38.740
Mr. Croft.

58
00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:39.740
I didn't mean it.

59
00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:40.740
Hey, Andy.

60
00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.740
I want you to take her to HR, fire her immediately.
