00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.399
I want you to take her to HR, fire her immediately.

2
00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:06.559
Whatever your intentions may be here, then I welcome.

3
00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:09.320
And we have a meeting with a Chinese client today.

4
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.439
Elise is the only one in the secretarial department

5
00:00:11.439 --> 00:00:22.059
who speaks fluent Mandarin.

6
00:00:22.059 --> 00:00:25.149
Elise, this is your one chance.

7
00:00:25.149 --> 00:00:26.589
OK, don't blow it.

8
00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:27.829
I can do it.

9
00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:49.780
Oh, she's exact.

10
00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:50.619
Elise.

11
00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:51.619
Yes, Mr. Croft?

12
00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:53.179
And he's going to take you to sign the contract

13
00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:54.700
to be my new secretary.

14
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:55.579
Really?

15
00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:56.619
I don't have to leave.

16
00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:59.100
She's the longest performer we've had here today.

17
00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.740
Professional.

18
00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:01.060
Of course, Mr. Croft.

19
00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:14.060
I promise I will work really hard and I won't let you down.

20
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.260
Well, I guess good looks are worth something around here.

21
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:19.939
Must be nice.

22
00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:22.859
Meanwhile, the rest of us have to do actual work around here

23
00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:26.579
in our nice outfit.

24
00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:29.099
Must have cost a pretty penny.

25
00:01:29.099 --> 00:01:30.500
But you know what?

26
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.780
Mr. Croft hates a gold digger.

27
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.219
Well, if you're so above it all,

28
00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:38.780
why don't you work for Mr. Croft for a bono?

29
00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.379
I bet he'd love that.

30
00:01:41.379 --> 00:01:45.500
I only love when employees back up their salaries

31
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.609
at the performance.

32
00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:50.409
Hey, can you drive?

33
00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:52.829
Yes, I can.

34
00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:53.950
Good catch.

35
00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:06.180
Mr. Croft?

36
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.780
Elise, I thought you said you could drive.

37
00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.800
Well, I haven't driven all that much since I got my license.

38
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.120
Are you all right?

39
00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.090
You're gone.

40
00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.689
Elise, your hand.

41
00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:21.889
I'm sorry.

42
00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:23.409
What is this?
