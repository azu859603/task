00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.349
I'll go wrap these for you guys.

2
00:00:05.349 --> 00:00:10.900
Wow.

3
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:17.460
Elise, great job with the gifts today.

4
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.460
You know what?

5
00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:19.460
I want you to stop off at HR.

6
00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:20.460
Grab your bonus.

7
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.460
Bonus for shopping?

8
00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:23.460
How much?

9
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.460
Oh, Mr. Croft.

10
00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.460
Don't you need me to drive you home?

11
00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:28.460
No, you're not.

12
00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:29.460
I'm going to meet up with my fiance.

13
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.460
So I'll drive myself.

14
00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.460
You can go home too.

15
00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:32.460
Great.

16
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.460
I'll get a gift for my roommate and then I'll head home.

17
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.140
Have a great day, Mr. Croft.

18
00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.520
I can't wait to tell Eleanor about all of this.

19
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:48.859
All of this is for me?

20
00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:49.859
Yeah.

21
00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:50.929
Do you like it?

22
00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:53.439
I adore it.

23
00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:56.570
Like this must have cost a fortune.

24
00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:57.570
Hey.

25
00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.570
Hey.

26
00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.240
It's not about the cost.

27
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.240
Okay?

28
00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.240
That's about us.

29
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.240
Ellie.

30
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.239
I can't risk losing any of this.

31
00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.939
But if I bear his child,

32
00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.939
he'll have to stay with me.

33
00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:12.969
Even if he earns the truth.

34
00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:21.909
Clyde.

35
00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:23.810
What?

36
00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.099
Why does it feel so strange when Ellie and I get intimate?

37
00:01:28.099 --> 00:01:29.099
Hey.

38
00:01:29.099 --> 00:01:30.099
Hey, you know.

39
00:01:30.099 --> 00:01:31.099
You should.

40
00:01:31.099 --> 00:01:33.099
You should get some rest.

41
00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:34.099
Good.

42
00:01:34.099 --> 00:01:35.099
Yeah.

43
00:01:35.099 --> 00:01:36.099
Um.

44
00:01:36.099 --> 00:01:42.099
Hey, you know, I got some stuff to do.

45
00:01:42.099 --> 00:01:44.290
So I'll see you later.

46
00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:45.290
Okay?

47
00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:46.290
Take care of those.
