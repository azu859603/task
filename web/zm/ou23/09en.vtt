00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:26.289
Yeah, yeah, yeah, he just spun.

2
00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:27.559
When did you meet him?

3
00:00:27.559 --> 00:00:30.359
And why do I not get to be introduced to him?

4
00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.950
I'll introduce you to him when I know him a little bit.

5
00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:35.990
Enough about me, tell me about your dates.

6
00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:40.070
Okay, well, I brought us this cake to celebrate

7
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.030
because I got the job!

8
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.609
Oh, you made it through your stay.

9
00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:48.170
Yeah, well, I almost got fired,

10
00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.289
but once I showed them what I could do,

11
00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:52.090
they gave it to me on the spot.

12
00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.649
You are looking at Mr. Croft's new secretary.

13
00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.530
So, tell me everything.

14
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.900
Is your boss, like, so rich and hot as hell?

15
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.579
He's definitely handsome,

16
00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:14.500
but he's very in love with his fiance.

17
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.299
He dropped, like, $3 million on a ring

18
00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:19.219
without even batting an eye.

19
00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:25.209
She's a lucky woman, into Mr. Croft.

20
00:01:25.209 --> 00:01:28.890
Oh, no, he's my boss, that's it.

21
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.489
You know me, I would never want another woman's man.

22
00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:33.530
I just don't want you catching feelings

23
00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.790
with the wrong guy and getting hurt.

24
00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.790
After the bridal shop fiasco,

25
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.180
I had my heart on lockdown.

26
00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.900
At the ring, my boss just bought for his fiance.
