1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,359
Isn't that the ring my boss just bought for his fiance?

2
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:04,360
No.

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:05,839
I can't remember any of this.

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:10,560
God, imagine if you were donating my boss.

5
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,880
We would be like, set for life.

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:15,660
What's up?

7
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:16,660
Matt.

8
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:17,780
Hey.

9
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:20,859
For real, Eleanor, we'll be passing through our kids.

10
00:00:20,859 --> 00:00:22,300
And now you're being all secretive and like,

11
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:23,500
you're a wealthy boyfriend?

12
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,820
I...

13
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,260
I've seen him when you write.

14
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,100
It's hella fancy.

15
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,820
You didn't tell me he was rich,

16
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,620
and he drives us when you're dreaming for like, ever.

17
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:32,820
I bet you.

18
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,100
As soon as she moves into her mansion,

19
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,750
she won't ever acknowledge us as friends anymore.

20
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:38,950
Don't say that.

21
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:40,549
You know it's not true.

22
00:00:40,549 --> 00:00:44,750
No.

23
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:45,750
Me Me and Amaro attended.

24
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,950
We'll be reading some clients to talk about our partnership.

25
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:50,490
And dress sharpened.

26
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:52,490
I hope we'll get you married.

27
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:54,490
Hey, what are you doing?

28
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:56,490
What's with you?

29
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:57,490
Mr. Croft.

30
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:00,479
Hold on one second, okay?

31
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:04,030
I heard you purchased the $150 million true love necklace

32
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:06,349
for your fiance at the charity auction.

33
00:01:06,349 --> 00:01:09,769
This must be Mrs. Croft, I presume.

34
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:10,769
No.

35
00:01:10,769 --> 00:01:12,489
There's been a misunderstanding, sir.

36
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:14,170
I'm Mr. Croft's secretary.

37
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:15,170
At least.

38
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:23,530
Hi.

39
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:24,530
Grandma.

40
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:26,680
Kelly, to me.

41
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,379
As soon as I'm done with this meeting,

42
00:01:30,379 --> 00:01:34,099
I'll have Annie bring her to see you.

43
00:01:34,099 --> 00:01:39,939
I never expected Mr. Croft to have such a haughty like you working for him.

44
00:01:39,939 --> 00:01:40,939
And I mean,

45
00:01:40,939 --> 00:01:44,609
I can tell you must work out with the body like that, hm?

46
00:01:44,609 --> 00:01:46,609
Mr. Croft will be back any minute now.

47
00:01:46,609 --> 00:01:47,609
That's okay.

48
00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:48,609
Oh.

49
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:52,689
What do you think you're doing?

50
00:01:52,689 --> 00:01:54,890
I am Mr. Croft's secretary.

51
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:55,890
Secretary?

52
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:59,489
You think a secretary is going to get in the way of a billion dollar deal?

53
00:01:59,489 --> 00:02:04,329
As a matter of fact, I think he'd be flattered if I took an interest to you at all.

54
00:02:04,329 --> 00:02:06,420
Flattered?

55
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,420
No.

56
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,419
Heroes?

57
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:09,419
Yes.

58
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:10,800
Ugh.

59
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,800
Ugh.
