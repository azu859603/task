00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.780
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

2
00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:03.100
Oh, okay.

3
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:03.940
You okay?

4
00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:04.740
What the hell are you doing?

5
00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:05.740
Is she really worth it?

6
00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:07.799
You're just gonna throw away a partnership like that?

7
00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.039
The Croft Corporation will never do business with scum, like you ever again.

8
00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:22.269
You okay?

9
00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:25.539
Mr. Croft.

10
00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:26.539
It's nothing.

11
00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:28.760
You cancelled a billion dollar partnership because of me.

12
00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.980
It just seems like a big loss.

13
00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.500
You're really talking about the deal right now?

14
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.899
I'm just, I'm afraid I might have caused myself this job.

15
00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.539
It's not gonna happen, okay?

16
00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:39.700
We're my secretary.

17
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.700
Someone messes with you.

18
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:48.960
You, they mess with me.

19
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:49.960
Is Band-Aid?

20
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.719
What, Mr. Croft?

21
00:00:51.719 --> 00:01:06.090
Nothing.

22
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.129
Mr. Croft, you don't want to drive me.

23
00:01:08.129 --> 00:01:10.299
You don't have to take it out on me.

24
00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:12.310
Ellie?

25
00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.540
Did you just tap your nose?

26
00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.219
Is tapping your nose against the law now?

27
00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:20.540
No.

28
00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.140
What is going on?

29
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.909
Why does Elise keep reminding me of Ellie?

30
00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:26.750
Let's go.

31
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:27.549
Where are we going?

32
00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:28.390
My grandma's house.

33
00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.680
I'm going to bring my fiance to meet her.

34
00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:33.760
Mr. Croft?

35
00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.040
Won't it be a bit awkward if I'm there

36
00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.359
while your significant other meets your grandma?

37
00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:41.400
Secretary Elise, are you just going to stand there

38
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.799
and watch me carry all these?

39
00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.760
Oh, no, Mr. Croft.

40
00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:51.650
I've got it.

41
00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:56.769
Mr. Croft, you are a wealthy, good-looking, and kind man.

42
00:01:56.769 --> 00:01:59.569
Mrs. Croft must be pretty amazing to have caught your eye.

43
00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:02.250
Well, in my eye, she's more than just amazing.

44
00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.290
How did you two meet?

45
00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:04.650
20 years ago.

46
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.129
You know, she saved my life once.

47
00:02:06.129 --> 00:02:08.289
Childhood sweetheart's.

48
00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:13.479
Must be a pretty tight one.

49
00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:15.680
Well, who is this other woman?

50
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.650
Another one trying to get with Clyde?

51
00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.169
You know, after she saved my life, I went abroad.

52
00:02:21.169 --> 00:02:27.270
And we actually reunited recently.

53
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.189
Sounds a lot like my story.

54
00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:32.400
Minus the tragedy.

55
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.479
Clyde, honey.

56
00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:35.639
Sorry to keep you waiting.

57
00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:37.479
I know my sister's young lady.

58
00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:39.930
Eleanor?

59
00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.379
Eleanor?

60
00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:42.539
It's you.

61
00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:44.599
Elise.

62
00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:46.080
Eleanor is my fiance.

63
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.400
But I thought you two were best friends you didn't know.

64
00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.120
Eleanor, you were single when we were trying on wedding dresses,

65
00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.319
and now you're engaged to my boss?

66
00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:55.509
What are you talking about?

67
00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:56.599
Oh.

68
00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:00.150
At last.

69
00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:10.370
Then why was Elise at the shop?

70
00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.250
She was accompanying me.

71
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.210
I told you, Elise has always had this weird thing about trying

72
00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.370
to take everything away from me that I loved.

73
00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.289
And I thought she might make a move on you,

74
00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:21.050
so that's why I didn't tell her about us.

75
00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:22.889
Elise is not that kind of person.

76
00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:23.770
See?

77
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.009
You've only known her for a few days,

78
00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:27.689
and she's already got you taking her side.

79
00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:32.699
Elise is a pro at manipulating men.

80
00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:34.620
You're not falling further, are you?

81
00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.300
Oh, hey, come on.

82
00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.259
I promised to marry you.

83
00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:40.979
I wouldn't even glance at another woman.

84
00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:43.580
Good, because she is a gossip, OK?

85
00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.430
From now on, we cannot discuss our relationship with her.

86
00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.990
OK.

87
00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:55.520
You're best.

88
00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.270
Eleanor, what's going on?

89
00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:01.750
It's kind of a funny story.

90
00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.550
Clyde asked me to marry him when we were kids,

91
00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:07.430
and I just never really took him seriously.

92
00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.909
But we reconnected, and I realized how amazing he is.

93
00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:16.569
And look, I just wanted to make sure

94
00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:19.769
that we were stable enough before I told you about us.

95
00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:24.569
And that's the truth.

96
00:04:24.569 --> 00:04:28.410
Just don't lie to me again or we threw.

97
00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:29.689
He calls me Elise, isn't it?

98
00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:34.930
So cute.

99
00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.529
Yeah, super cute.

100
00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:45.839
Hey, what's inside?

101
00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.240
No, don't worry about it.

102
00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.120
It's my job.

103
00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.000
Clyde, what are we doing here?

104
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.279
I've seen my grandmother.

105
00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:54.680
You know, she's been talking about you for the past 20

106
00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.199
years, ever since I met you.

107
00:04:56.199 --> 00:04:59.439
What this old woman has seen Elise before?

108
00:04:59.439 --> 00:05:02.519
Clyde, can we please take a rain check?

109
00:05:02.519 --> 00:05:04.959
I'm not ready for this.

110
00:05:04.959 --> 00:05:07.629
Clyde, where's my Ellie?

111
00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:11.120
Grandma, this is Ellie.

112
00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:16.120
Eleanor.

113
00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.629
This isn't the girl that saved you.

114
00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:27.569
But this girl, she looks more like Ellie.

115
00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:29.250
This girl looks like Ellie.

116
00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.089
You were just a little thing 20 years ago.

117
00:05:32.089 --> 00:05:36.259
Now you're all grown up and so pretty.

118
00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:37.779
I think you're mistaken.

119
00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:39.899
You have the wrong person.

120
00:05:39.899 --> 00:05:41.740
Don't you think you can fool me?

121
00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.860
This young lady doesn't look a thing like Ellie

122
00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.860
when she was a kid.

123
00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.779
You know, maybe it's just that I have one of those faces.

124
00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:51.339
Yeah, Grandma, I'm the real Ellie.

125
00:05:51.339 --> 00:05:55.480
Clyde, how could you mistake me for some meals?

126
00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.399
Oh, dear.

127
00:05:56.399 --> 00:05:59.160
Well, maybe I am getting forgetful.

128
00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.600
Let's go inside.

129
00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:19.459
Excuse yourselves.

130
00:06:19.459 --> 00:06:23.180
So nice to see you two together again.

131
00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:34.279
Well, I am thrilled to be reunited with Clyde.

132
00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:37.120
Aside from the jewelry, you have the title

133
00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.120
to a helicopter and three airlines,

134
00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:41.800
all for your engagement.

135
00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:42.800
All for me?

136
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.329
And when you and Clyde get married,

137
00:06:46.329 --> 00:06:48.589
private island.

138
00:06:48.589 --> 00:06:50.350
Very, thank you.

139
00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:53.279
You are at the Clyde.

140
00:06:53.279 --> 00:06:55.800
We are going to have the most perfect life together.

141
00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.120
Wonderful.

142
00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:00.800
Make sure you pick up a great day for Sarah.

143
00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:10.560
Well, Clyde is the man with the plan, right, honey?

144
00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:35.860
You OK?

145
00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:37.699
You two are good to go.

146
00:07:37.699 --> 00:07:54.279
Good.

147
00:07:54.279 --> 00:07:55.800
You had your chance.

148
00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.310
This is all mine now.

149
00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:59.189
By the way, how's the pocket watch?

150
00:07:59.189 --> 00:08:02.389
Was the photo of Ellie OK?

151
00:08:02.389 --> 00:08:05.149
Yeah, it's fine.

152
00:08:05.149 --> 00:08:07.910
The photo, you look so much like Elise.

153
00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:11.759
Thank God Clyde didn't notice.

154
00:08:11.759 --> 00:08:15.160
You were such a cutie pie as a kid.

155
00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:16.759
I wonder what happened.

156
00:08:16.759 --> 00:08:18.040
Don't feel bad.

157
00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.839
Even though you're not as pretty as before,

158
00:08:20.839 --> 00:08:22.319
you're still a good kid.

159
00:08:22.319 --> 00:08:25.600
She really has changed quite a bit.

160
00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:29.910
Well, Ellie, before your engagement,

161
00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:31.990
why don't you move in with Clyde?

162
00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:35.200
You've got a lot of catching up to do.

163
00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.320
Clyde, would it be OK if I'm moving with you?

164
00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.600
I would really like to get Zoe better.

165
00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:41.509
Yeah.

166
00:08:41.509 --> 00:08:42.509
Let's do it.

167
00:08:42.509 --> 00:08:50.879
You can move into my place.

168
00:08:50.879 --> 00:08:53.080
I am going to seal the deal and become

169
00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:56.039
Mrs. Croft in every sense of the word.

170
00:08:56.039 --> 00:09:19.509
Oh, Clyde.

171
00:09:19.509 --> 00:09:20.350
Where's that?

172
00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:21.370
It's me.

173
00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:22.370
Ellie, are you OK?

174
00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:22.970
I'm fine.

175
00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:23.970
I'm fine.

176
00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:25.370
Today, it doesn't hurt, it's fine.

177
00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:28.289
Well, let's just, first of all, we should take care of your eye

178
00:09:28.289 --> 00:09:29.049
for it gets worse.

179
00:09:29.049 --> 00:09:30.649
Yeah, it's my aid doesn't hurt at all.

180
00:09:30.649 --> 00:09:32.450
No, I mean, we really should check it out.

181
00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:33.610
I mean, you can get back.

182
00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:35.809
You're OK, I just, I really, I really want it.

183
00:09:35.809 --> 00:09:38.440
I put your eye on me.

184
00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:41.200
Let's check it out.

185
00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:42.039
Is that bad?

186
00:09:42.039 --> 00:09:43.919
It's, I mean, it's, yeah.

187
00:09:43.919 --> 00:09:44.600
My God.

188
00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:52.690
Yeah.

189
00:09:52.690 --> 00:10:04.679
Why do I keep dreaming about Elise?

190
00:10:04.679 --> 00:10:06.159
This meeting is critical.

191
00:10:06.159 --> 00:10:07.879
If I can pin this on Elise, she'll

192
00:10:07.879 --> 00:10:10.039
be out of craft corporation for good.

193
00:10:10.039 --> 00:10:11.750
Then that job will be fine.

194
00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:13.470
Hot coffee coming through.

195
00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:19.340
Oh, these are the documents for the company meeting.

196
00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:19.860
Shh.

197
00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:21.740
And we don't have time to put in new ones.

198
00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:23.820
Elise, you messed up the meeting.

199
00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:26.340
I'll explain it to Mr. Croft.

200
00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:28.340
You think that your pathetic apology will

201
00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:30.899
make Mr. Croft go easy on you?

202
00:10:30.899 --> 00:10:33.500
In your dreams, you're good as God, Missy.

203
00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:35.639
What's going on here?

204
00:10:35.639 --> 00:10:36.679
You're screwed.

205
00:10:36.679 --> 00:10:39.120
Mr. Croft, you ruined the documents.

206
00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:40.720
Now she's trying to play the victim.

207
00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:41.919
What happened?

208
00:10:41.919 --> 00:10:42.799
Mr. Croft, she.

209
00:10:42.799 --> 00:10:44.120
Back off.

210
00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:45.120
You OK?

211
00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:56.070
Back.

212
00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:57.610
Anything.

213
00:10:57.610 --> 00:11:03.279
Get the car ready.

214
00:11:03.279 --> 00:11:05.080
What just happened?

215
00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:07.519
I've never seen Mr. Croft treating anyone like that.

216
00:11:07.519 --> 00:11:10.720
The way he's carrying her is by carrying a bride.

217
00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:15.200
And their eyes are like, if Mr. Croft finds out

218
00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:19.690
I spilled the water, I'm screwed.

219
00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:20.529
How is she?

220
00:11:20.529 --> 00:11:21.610
It's nothing serious.

221
00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:22.490
You're good to go.

222
00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:23.330
Thanks, Doug.

223
00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:26.090
You know, I think we should keep her here for another day,

224
00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:27.450
just to be sure.

225
00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:28.889
Actually, I'm fine.

226
00:11:28.889 --> 00:11:32.169
I promise you, Mr. Croft, there's nothing to worry about.

227
00:11:32.169 --> 00:11:35.690
No, I insist I want her to be 100%.

228
00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:36.289
Sure.

229
00:11:36.289 --> 00:11:38.429
Thank you.

230
00:11:38.429 --> 00:11:40.070
Why is he overreacting?

231
00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:43.029
He seems to really care about him.

232
00:11:43.029 --> 00:11:44.070
Stop it, Elise.

233
00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:45.429
He's Eleanor's fiance.

234
00:11:45.429 --> 00:11:46.190
All right.

235
00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:48.590
I ruined those files, so I need to check if there's back.

236
00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:49.669
Files are all backed up.

237
00:11:49.669 --> 00:11:51.669
Nothing's going to affect our work.

238
00:11:51.669 --> 00:11:52.990
That is a relief.

239
00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:54.429
You know what?

240
00:11:54.429 --> 00:11:55.870
Why don't you take a few days off?

241
00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:57.070
No need to come into the office.

242
00:11:57.070 --> 00:12:00.350
Mr. Croft, can I count those as my sick days?

243
00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:18.850
I don't want to miss out on a paycheck.

244
00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:20.730
Are you really worried about a few extra bucks?

245
00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:23.269
Well, yes.

246
00:12:23.269 --> 00:12:24.789
With the cost of living these days,

247
00:12:24.789 --> 00:12:27.350
and there's my Uber rides, and I need that,

248
00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:30.480
and Boba would be nice.

249
00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:31.799
Yeah?

250
00:12:31.799 --> 00:12:33.120
Please?

251
00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:33.600
Don't worry.

252
00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.279
I'll make sure you get your paycheck.

253
00:12:35.279 --> 00:12:43.720
Thank you, Mr. Croft.

254
00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:45.730
Mr. Croft.

255
00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:47.049
What are you doing here?

256
00:12:47.049 --> 00:12:50.509
Elise, I owe you an apology.

257
00:12:50.509 --> 00:12:51.549
For what?

258
00:12:51.549 --> 00:12:53.029
No, no.

259
00:12:53.029 --> 00:12:54.190
I just tripped over something.

260
00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:55.029
It's not your fault.

261
00:12:55.029 --> 00:12:56.230
I'm so sorry.

262
00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:58.830
I rushed you back there.

263
00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:03.769
We were in such a time crunch, and I really shouldn't have done that.

264
00:13:03.889 --> 00:13:05.009
I really shouldn't have done that.

265
00:13:05.009 --> 00:13:06.610
Well, that's just a part of the job.

266
00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:07.129
No.

267
00:13:07.129 --> 00:13:10.399
No job is worth risking an employee's safety.

268
00:13:10.399 --> 00:13:11.000
Right.

269
00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:11.879
Hey, look at me.

270
00:13:11.879 --> 00:13:13.840
This cannot happen again.

271
00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:15.000
Yes, Mr. Croft.

272
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:21.529
Oh my god, what's going on?

273
00:13:21.529 --> 00:13:25.450
They said you were in the hospital, but I'm so worried.

274
00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:29.049
First, all the weird stuff going on between Mr. Croft and Elise,

275
00:13:29.049 --> 00:13:31.330
and now this lady.

276
00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:33.289
Yeah, I'm fine.

277
00:13:33.289 --> 00:13:34.129
It's, you know what?

278
00:13:34.129 --> 00:13:35.450
Oh my god, Elise.

279
00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:37.210
I take good tumble, but it's fine.

280
00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:38.210
Mr. Croft got me.

281
00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:41.570
Oh my god, are you all right?

282
00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:42.450
I'll be fine.

283
00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:44.370
I'm just going to rest for a couple of days.

284
00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:45.370
It's not a big deal.

285
00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:46.850
Mr. Croft, thank you.

286
00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:48.570
You can get back to what you were doing.

287
00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:49.570
Yeah, Clyde.

288
00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:55.559
I'll stay with Elise in the chat for a little bit.

289
00:13:55.559 --> 00:14:03.120
Hey, Rod, can you make sure that you drive my fiance back

290
00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:03.879
when she's done?

291
00:14:03.879 --> 00:14:18.029
Yes, Mr. Croft.

292
00:14:18.029 --> 00:14:21.059
Ma'am, I'll be waiting for you outside.

293
00:14:21.059 --> 00:14:31.669
I look forward to being of service to you.

294
00:14:31.669 --> 00:14:33.950
Elise, you sure know how to make me onward?

295
00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:34.950
I'm fine.

296
00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:37.309
Well, you still had me on pins and needles.

297
00:14:37.309 --> 00:14:38.710
It was just a little accident.

298
00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:39.549
It was nothing.

299
00:14:39.549 --> 00:14:42.029
Listen, why don't you just quit your job?

300
00:14:42.029 --> 00:14:44.389
Whatever they're paying you, I will match it.

301
00:14:44.389 --> 00:14:46.549
Are you trying to be my sugar mama now?

302
00:14:46.549 --> 00:14:48.269
We had a deal, right?

303
00:14:48.269 --> 00:14:50.710
Whoever gets ahead first will take care of the other,

304
00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:53.190
and Clyde's been really generous.

305
00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:55.750
I don't know, that's nice, but that was just great work.

306
00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:57.649
I prefer to make my own money.

307
00:14:57.649 --> 00:15:01.850
But working such a grind, I could see my girl go through that.

308
00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:04.129
Working is tough, but it makes me feel safe.

309
00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:07.649
Yeah, well, I just want a guy who has my back,

310
00:15:07.649 --> 00:15:10.840
but showers me in person and jewelry.

311
00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:13.200
Eleanor, people change.

312
00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:14.919
You can't always count on a guy.

313
00:15:14.919 --> 00:15:18.409
Yes, but I have a good feeling about Clyde.

314
00:15:18.409 --> 00:15:20.289
He's a keeper.

315
00:15:20.289 --> 00:15:27.899
Listen, Elise, there is something that I should tell you about.

316
00:15:27.899 --> 00:15:28.740
What is it?

317
00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:30.779
There's no secrets between us, you can tell me.

318
00:15:30.779 --> 00:15:34.470
I know that you're Clyde's secretary,

319
00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:38.350
but ever since you started working that job,

320
00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:40.990
I've heard some ugly rumors about you two.

321
00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:44.990
Eleanor, I swear Mr. Croft and I are purely professional.

322
00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:47.990
I know, but you know how rumors go.

323
00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:49.629
So why don't you just quit?

324
00:15:49.629 --> 00:15:50.470
Quit your job.

325
00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:52.309
I don't care about some silly gossip.

326
00:15:52.309 --> 00:15:53.389
Okay, but I do.

327
00:15:53.389 --> 00:16:02.399
Eleanor, I love my job and I'm not quitting.

328
00:16:02.399 --> 00:16:14.590
That's here, I won't leave you guys to it.

329
00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:16.480
Afternoon, ma'am.

330
00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:35.740
Right this way, please.

331
00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:42.860
ma'am, you're home.

332
00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:46.049
Watch your head.

333
00:16:46.049 --> 00:16:48.580
I know your place.

334
00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:49.419
I like you.

335
00:16:49.419 --> 00:16:50.899
Your wish is my command.

336
00:16:50.899 --> 00:16:52.519
Really?

337
00:16:52.519 --> 00:16:56.399
Well, at least we'll be back at work the day after tomorrow, right?

338
00:16:56.399 --> 00:16:57.000
Yes.

339
00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.039
Perfect.

340
00:16:58.039 --> 00:16:59.440
Then I will be there too.

341
00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:09.200
Tie time, everybody knows exactly who Clyde's future wife is.

342
00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:18.200
Mrs. Croft is here.

343
00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:21.119
Good morning, Mrs. Croft.

344
00:17:21.119 --> 00:17:24.140
He's up, folks.

345
00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:27.299
I am still Clyde's fiance.

346
00:17:27.339 --> 00:17:28.420
Just Ellie is fine.

347
00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:30.779
Good morning, Mrs. Sally.

348
00:17:30.779 --> 00:17:31.940
Stop, stop, stop.

349
00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:33.940
I am just like you guys.

350
00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:37.539
I am just dressed head to toe and product.

351
00:17:37.539 --> 00:17:41.400
Well, I made you guys some cookies.

352
00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:46.809
Dig in.

353
00:17:46.809 --> 00:17:47.410
Down.

354
00:17:47.410 --> 00:17:49.329
This is the best cookie I've ever had.

355
00:17:49.329 --> 00:17:51.519
Oh, stop, Ellie.

356
00:17:51.519 --> 00:17:56.960
Yours, orders, and cameras are totally meant to be.

357
00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:58.599
Wow, totally meant to be.

358
00:17:58.599 --> 00:18:01.720
Speaking of, Clyde, I am going to go find him.

359
00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:03.819
I will see you guys later.

360
00:18:04.819 --> 00:18:16.640
They expect Mr. Croft's fiance to be Mrs. Ellie.

361
00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:20.480
I've always thought it leads a Mr. Croft.

362
00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:21.880
Cut the crap.

363
00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:25.240
Everyone knows that Mr. Croft has a special someone.

364
00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:27.519
And that person is Mrs. Ellie.

365
00:18:27.519 --> 00:18:29.319
He's put her on a pedestal.

366
00:18:29.319 --> 00:18:32.079
Besides, Mr. Croft is a good guy.

367
00:18:32.079 --> 00:18:35.839
It's unfortunate how many sneaky gold diggers

368
00:18:35.839 --> 00:18:37.319
he has to fight off every day.

369
00:18:37.319 --> 00:18:38.480
Are you talking about me?

370
00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:41.400
Mr. Croft would never give you the time of day.

371
00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:46.200
Yeah, and Mr. Croft's actual fiance is gorgeous and generous.

372
00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:49.440
You think, just because Mr. Croft helped you one time

373
00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:51.599
that you've made it into high society?

374
00:18:51.599 --> 00:18:53.960
No, you misunderstand.

375
00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:55.799
I'm Ellie's best friend.

376
00:18:55.799 --> 00:19:00.140
Mr. Croft only helped me because of her.

377
00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:01.759
Mr. Croft?

378
00:19:01.759 --> 00:19:18.119
At least.

379
00:19:18.119 --> 00:19:21.319
Probably didn't help her to get lost.

380
00:19:21.319 --> 00:19:33.019
I think that we should protect her.

381
00:19:33.019 --> 00:19:35.220
What's with the jitters?

382
00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:45.240
Not what it looks like.

383
00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:46.240
I tripped.

384
00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:51.529
And Mr. Croft caught me.

385
00:19:51.529 --> 00:19:53.170
No need to explain.

386
00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:57.519
Just messing with you.

387
00:19:57.519 --> 00:20:02.400
The two people in this world that I trust the most.

388
00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:05.960
My best friend.

389
00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:07.960
My loving fiance.

390
00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:08.960
Right, honey?

391
00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:10.089
Of course.

392
00:20:10.089 --> 00:20:11.220
In my fiance.

393
00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:14.779
I would never dream of anything else.

394
00:20:14.779 --> 00:20:18.279
Um, you know what, why don't you go home?

395
00:20:18.279 --> 00:20:19.279
Ellie, wait for me.

396
00:20:19.279 --> 00:20:20.279
Right?

397
00:20:20.279 --> 00:20:44.779
Well, Ellie and I, we still have some business to attend to, so.

398
00:20:44.779 --> 00:20:45.779
Clients from Italy.

399
00:20:45.779 --> 00:20:49.369
If we close this deal, we'll double your bonus.

400
00:20:49.369 --> 00:20:51.369
You can trust me, Mr. Croft.

401
00:20:51.369 --> 00:20:53.109
I know I can.

402
00:20:53.109 --> 00:21:01.529
Ms. Croft.

403
00:21:01.529 --> 00:21:09.230
Find a way to tank her project and ruin that deal.

404
00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:13.160
I want her to crash and burn.

405
00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:14.160
You got it, Ms. Croft.

406
00:21:14.160 --> 00:22:00.000
I can't wait to see you fall on your face with your stupid deal and Mr. deal.

407
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.000
Good morning, Mr. Croft.

408
00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.509
Good morning.

409
00:22:03.509 --> 00:22:04.599
You look.

410
00:22:05.829 --> 00:22:06.829
Ready.

411
00:22:06.829 --> 00:22:09.829
Well, I think we should all be prepared for good things after this meeting.

412
00:22:09.829 --> 00:22:14.539
Yeah.

413
00:22:14.539 --> 00:22:15.670
Are you okay?

414
00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:16.670
I'm fine.

415
00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:17.670
I'm good to go.

416
00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:28.289
I didn't get a smile like that in you, Mr. Croft.

417
00:22:28.289 --> 00:22:44.720
Of course.

418
00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:47.079
Mr. Croft was the fortune on the last project.

419
00:22:47.079 --> 00:22:48.319
I have to make it up to him.

420
00:22:48.319 --> 00:22:49.319
Let her in.

421
00:22:49.319 --> 00:22:53.039
Mr. Bianchi.

422
00:22:53.039 --> 00:23:14.339
I would like to share our proposal with you.

423
00:23:14.339 --> 00:23:44.039
I think you'll be very happy with what we've put forth.

424
00:23:44.039 --> 00:24:00.000
Glad to hear you're happy with the dividends.

425
00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.400
Someone's messed with the numbers.

426
00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:04.000
Mr. Bianchi, give me one more day to fix the proposal.

427
00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.190
You've lost my trust.

428
00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:11.079
I can't believe I wasted my pazonella on this girl.

429
00:24:11.079 --> 00:24:19.690
Please, Mr. Bianchi, please.

430
00:24:19.690 --> 00:24:27.920
Is that Keonti?

431
00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:29.720
What do you know about a Keonti?

432
00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:32.400
I love a good Keonti.

433
00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:36.539
My known, I used to stomp the grapes yourself.

434
00:24:36.539 --> 00:24:39.000
Are you from Tuscany?

435
00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.000
Here goes nothing.

436
00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.000
Yeah.

437
00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.160
I am, actually.

438
00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:44.119
I was raised there until I was 10.

439
00:24:44.119 --> 00:24:47.079
Actually, I was two, and I barely remember anything.

440
00:24:49.920 --> 00:25:05.779
So you tell him, this whole time in front of me

441
00:25:05.779 --> 00:25:07.920
got plenty of Keonti.

442
00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:09.160
You fancy a glass?

443
00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:14.529
Well, no, Mr. Bianchi, I'm not much of a drinker.

444
00:25:14.529 --> 00:25:19.160
You just told me that you loved a good Keonti.

445
00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:21.279
Were you lying to me then?

446
00:25:21.279 --> 00:25:23.119
I can't ruin this.

447
00:25:23.119 --> 00:25:24.180
No.

448
00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:25.420
No, of course not.

449
00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:26.019
No.

450
00:25:26.019 --> 00:25:26.579
Let's do it.

451
00:25:26.579 --> 00:25:27.099
Yes.

452
00:25:27.099 --> 00:25:28.099
Let's have a glass.

453
00:25:28.099 --> 00:25:29.460
Thank you.

454
00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:31.180
Then we'll drink.

455
00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:35.180
Then we can go over this proposal yours.

456
00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:36.180
Great.

457
00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:47.690
All right.

458
00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:54.009
Elise, enjoy talking to it this kind of.

459
00:25:54.009 --> 00:25:58.359
We make this partnership official.

460
00:25:58.359 --> 00:26:00.359
Thank you, Mr. Bianchi.

461
00:26:00.359 --> 00:26:48.880
Clyde!

462
00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:56.180
Early, I missed you like crazy.

463
00:26:56.180 --> 00:27:01.839
You're doing it?

464
00:27:01.839 --> 00:27:03.250
Who was that?

465
00:27:03.250 --> 00:27:15.250
Why don't Elise call and hang up?

466
00:27:15.250 --> 00:27:15.930
Where are you going?

467
00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:17.289
I've got some things to do.

468
00:27:17.289 --> 00:27:19.529
Listen, hey, it's getting late.

469
00:27:19.529 --> 00:27:28.519
I think you should get some rest too, OK?

470
00:27:28.519 --> 00:27:30.319
The hell?

471
00:27:30.319 --> 00:27:33.000
Why was Elise calling him so late?

472
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:37.119
She promised me that she wasn't into him.

473
00:27:37.119 --> 00:27:41.319
Little whore.

474
00:27:41.319 --> 00:27:43.589
Are you sealed the deal?

475
00:27:43.589 --> 00:28:06.410
I'm just going to sit here and sober up.

476
00:28:06.410 --> 00:28:07.730
You need a ride?

477
00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:10.170
This is a crop, Tim.

478
00:28:10.170 --> 00:28:13.569
Elise, your hands are freezing.

479
00:28:13.569 --> 00:28:15.609
Is it skidding warmer now?

480
00:28:15.609 --> 00:28:18.279
Hey, who made you drink this much?

481
00:28:18.279 --> 00:28:19.839
No one.

482
00:28:19.839 --> 00:28:22.720
I did it to seal your deal, Mr. Crog.

483
00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:27.750
Right now, your safety is my deal.

484
00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:45.400
When I first said my eyes on, that won't sound like that.

485
00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:53.309
Isn't he answering a piece with Elise?

486
00:28:53.309 --> 00:29:19.380
Elise, if you mess this up with me.

487
00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:23.630
Sir, why are you holding my hand?

488
00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:27.380
The other one is holding on to me, Elise.

489
00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:36.710
Sir, it sounds so nice when you say my name.

490
00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:38.839
You're sober now?

491
00:29:38.839 --> 00:29:40.359
Listen, I swear.

492
00:29:40.359 --> 00:29:44.319
If you ever get this wasted and I'm not there,

493
00:29:44.319 --> 00:29:47.740
then you're going to be consequences.

494
00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:53.150
Sir, did I ever tell you that you looked just like a boy I

495
00:29:53.150 --> 00:29:55.190
saved from bullies when I was a kid?

496
00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:57.789
You saved the boy from bullies?

497
00:29:57.789 --> 00:30:00.230
No park 20 years ago.

498
00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:03.960
What was the name of that park?

499
00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:10.329
It was, it was, I can't remember.

500
00:30:10.329 --> 00:30:10.970
Elise, come on.

501
00:30:10.970 --> 00:30:12.410
You've got to think, think, think.

502
00:30:12.410 --> 00:30:14.440
What was the name of that park?

503
00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:18.609
Aliens came to Earth.

504
00:30:18.609 --> 00:30:20.569
Pizza.

505
00:30:20.569 --> 00:30:23.180
They want extra cheese.

506
00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:24.829
Man, you're drunk.

507
00:30:24.829 --> 00:30:42.200
I can't believe I'm going nuts over your gibberish.

508
00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:42.880
Yeah.

509
00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:45.319
Boss, I got a handle on what happened today.

510
00:30:45.319 --> 00:30:46.440
It was Rod.

511
00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:47.720
Good.

512
00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:58.390
Let's put that guy in his place.

513
00:30:58.390 --> 00:30:59.390
What's up, Andy?

514
00:30:59.390 --> 00:31:01.150
Mr. Croft wants to see you.

515
00:31:01.150 --> 00:31:09.289
He has some great news to share.

516
00:31:09.289 --> 00:31:12.450
So, what's the good news, Mr. Croft?

517
00:31:12.450 --> 00:31:14.049
Rod.

518
00:31:14.049 --> 00:31:17.690
Hey, would you do us the honors and unwrapped?

519
00:31:18.009 --> 00:31:21.910
That gift for us, please.

520
00:31:21.910 --> 00:31:24.109
On it, Mr. Croft.
