00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So Elise has landed a collaboration with Mr. Bianchi and bagged herself a $200,000 commission.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,419
I thought you said it was good news.

3
00:00:10,419 --> 00:00:12,419
It is good news. For Elise.

4
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:21,420
Actually, I wanted to thank you. No, really. If it wasn't for you, I never would have figured out that I'm also a Somalia.

5
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:22,420
What do you mean by that?

6
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:27,420
Meaning that I see right through your little scheme, and I will not let anything like this ever happen again.

7
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,420
Well, you got this wrong. Let me explain.

8
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:31,420
Oh, you know what?

9
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:39,420
Since you have such a talent for opening up gifts, Andy, don't we have a spot open in logistics?

10
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,420
I believe we do, boss.

11
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:47,420
Oh, great. What's the work like down there in logistics?

12
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:53,420
It's just wrapping, unwrapping, pretty much all day every day in a nice little cold warehouse.

13
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,420
Warehouse.

14
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,420
Great.

15
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:56,420
Great.

16
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:01,420
Mr. Croft, if I could just please tell you that, wait. No, Mr. Croft, wait.

17
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:04,420
Please, no. Not logistics.

18
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:08,599
Thank you for supporting me, Mr. Croft.

19
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:12,099
I better get back to work.

20
00:01:12,099 --> 00:01:13,620
Wait.

21
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:30,099
Are you happy with these selections?

22
00:01:30,099 --> 00:01:32,099
What is always?

23
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:34,189
This is for you.

24
00:01:34,189 --> 00:01:37,189
I figured you might want some new clothes that don't smell like Yante.

25
00:01:37,189 --> 00:01:40,189
Oh, you know, we could also swap them out if you're not a fan.

26
00:01:40,189 --> 00:01:42,189
I'll bring a new rock right away.

27
00:01:42,189 --> 00:01:44,189
Wait, no, these are fine.

28
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:47,189
Mr. Croft, what is this all about?

29
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:48,189
You're my secretary.

30
00:01:48,189 --> 00:01:51,189
All right, you deserve a killer wardrobe.

31
00:01:51,189 --> 00:01:53,189
But this is a lot.

32
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:55,189
Yeah, and a lot means that you got options.

33
00:01:55,189 --> 00:01:59,189
You can't have you walking around the office in the same office every day, all right?

34
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:01,280
We'll take them all.

35
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,280
Charge it.
