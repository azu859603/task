00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.820
Excellent, sir. That'll be $230,000 in total.

2
00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:09.619
Great. You know what? Could you pack them up, send them over to Miss Elisa's residence, please.

3
00:00:09.619 --> 00:00:11.419
Monet, right away, sir.

4
00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:15.220
$230,000.

5
00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:16.620
How am I ever going to pay that off?

6
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:17.620
I beg your pardon?

7
00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.219
I'm sorry for calling you last night, Mr. Croft.

8
00:00:20.219 --> 00:00:23.420
I was just so drunk at it. It won't happen again.

9
00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:24.820
Hey, what are you talking about?

10
00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.480
I know it was late. I mean, you have every right to be mad, but...

11
00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.480
This is a punishment that I can't afford.

12
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.570
Punishment? What do you mean?

13
00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.570
What do you think? I'm taking all this out of your paycheck.

14
00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:35.369
Isn't it?

15
00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:40.909
No. Consider this your employee uniform collection.

16
00:00:40.909 --> 00:00:43.149
All on the company.

17
00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:48.179
Wow. I didn't know being your secretary came with such good perks.

18
00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:51.979
I mean, Mr. Croft, I'll work even harder now.

19
00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:54.780
And then I'll never have to worry about my wardrobe ever again.

20
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.380
You know, you're quite the character.

21
00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:04.230
Hello. Awesome. Thank you, Matt.

22
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.540
Mr. Croft, my friend is here again.

23
00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.700
Who's Matt?

24
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.530
Hey.

25
00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.980
Hey. You know how much you hated cold?

26
00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:18.980
You read my mind.

27
00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.329
And... I made you dinner.

28
00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:24.329
Awesome. Thank you.

29
00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:25.329
Let's go home.

30
00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:28.469
So how was your day?

31
00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:30.019
Pretty good.

32
00:01:30.019 --> 00:01:31.019
Yeah?

33
00:01:31.019 --> 00:01:32.019
Yeah. I'll go.

34
00:01:32.019 --> 00:01:33.019
I got a bonus.

35
00:01:33.019 --> 00:01:34.019
Really?

36
00:01:34.019 --> 00:01:35.140
Yeah.

37
00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.140
At least lives with another man.

38
00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.010
Got you this time.
