1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:02,980
Do you hear the latest?

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:04,980
Elise is already married.

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:06,980
Yeah, it's all the buzz.

4
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:08,980
We didn't see that coming.

5
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:10,980
You know, she acts all straight and laced.

6
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:14,980
And it turns out this whole time she's been playing the single card.

7
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:24,929
I mean, you kind of have to if you're trying to back the boss.

8
00:00:24,929 --> 00:00:29,969
Now you're all set.

9
00:00:29,969 --> 00:00:33,090
You got something to say?

10
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:34,090
Mr. Croft.

11
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:36,659
Are you aware that Elise is married?

12
00:00:36,659 --> 00:00:38,979
What are you talking about?

13
00:00:38,979 --> 00:00:40,979
I mean, it's been the talk of the company, Mr. Croft.
