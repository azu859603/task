1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,419
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

2
00:00:06,419 --> 00:00:08,419
This meeting starts in one minute.

3
00:00:08,419 --> 00:00:09,449
Oh.

4
00:00:09,449 --> 00:00:13,800
Yeah. Okay.

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:19,679
Yeah.

6
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:22,539
If Ellie wants more jewelry,

7
00:00:22,539 --> 00:00:24,539
it's gonna just send over the latest collection.

8
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:27,250
Mr. Croft, I'm running late for a meeting.

9
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:29,250
Can I get you right on your private elevator?

10
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:37,420
What?

11
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:39,420
Is something wrong with my outfit?

12
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:40,829
No.

13
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:41,899
Oh, good.

14
00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:45,780
You, um...

15
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:46,780
Yes, Mr. Croft?

16
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:47,780
I, um...

17
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:48,780
Oh, finally.

18
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,509
How come your employee profile issues are single

19
00:00:52,509 --> 00:00:56,659
when you're actually married?

20
00:00:56,659 --> 00:00:58,909
Hey, you running from the truth.

21
00:00:58,909 --> 00:00:59,909
From the truth.

22
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:00,909
Huh.
