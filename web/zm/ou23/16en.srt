1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,550
We'll take them off.

2
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:17,199
Ma'am, Mr. Croft said you can keep them all.

3
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:18,199
Then I will.

4
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:28,300
You said your girlfriend's birthday is coming up soon, right?

5
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,899
For her.

6
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:32,899
Ma'am, I couldn't.

7
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:36,530
Take it.

8
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:42,780
As long as you've got my back, I will take really good care of you.

9
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,780
Now hurry up and get Elise fired by any means necessary.

10
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:53,310
And if you succeed, I'll not lie, I'd remove you from logistics to VP.

11
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:56,500
Ma'am, I've got Elise by the short years.

12
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:01,170
I promise you, she's done for.

13
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:06,109
You know these people, they have no shame.

14
00:01:06,109 --> 00:01:11,109
She's married, yet she dresses up every day for the attention of every man in the office.

15
00:01:11,109 --> 00:01:12,109
It's so desperate, it makes me sick.

16
00:01:12,109 --> 00:01:14,109
Are you talking about me?

17
00:01:14,109 --> 00:01:17,260
You're a nerve, did I?

18
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:22,260
I didn't think being the center of office gossip would be such a problem for an attention-seeking whore like yourself.

19
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:26,409
Keep shaking that money maker.

20
00:01:26,409 --> 00:01:28,409
Shake it all the way to the top.

21
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:31,180
God, it must be good to be a woman.

22
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:33,180
BAM!
