00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:06,679
Mr. Karl.

2
00:00:06,679 --> 00:00:07,679
Elise, where are you?

3
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:12,500
Oh, Elise, you're gonna regret this.

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,730
There she is.

5
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:15,730
Let's move.

6
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:22,769
Wait, did you, um, get that, uh, translation that I was asking for?

7
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:27,920
Oh, Elise, I've been waiting to do this for so long.

8
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:28,920
What's going on?

9
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:29,920
What do you guys want?

10
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,920
I'm just trying to walk down Sunset Street and you're in my way.

11
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,920
I need you to come to Sunset Street with me.

12
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,100
Elise, I'm on my way.

13
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:40,189
Hold tight.

14
00:00:40,189 --> 00:00:41,189
What do I want?

15
00:00:41,189 --> 00:00:42,189
I lost my job.

16
00:00:42,189 --> 00:00:45,189
I lost everything because of you.

17
00:00:45,189 --> 00:00:46,189
Okay.

18
00:00:46,189 --> 00:00:47,189
Name your price.

19
00:00:47,189 --> 00:00:48,189
We can talk it through.

20
00:00:48,189 --> 00:00:49,380
No, I'm done talking.

21
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:52,380
Fellas, let's see if you're a lesson.

22
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:55,179
Don't get any closer or you'll regret it.

23
00:00:55,179 --> 00:00:57,179
Still threatening me, are you?

24
00:00:57,179 --> 00:00:59,539
Boys, you know what to do.
