1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:13,480
Get lost. I don't work for you anymore.

2
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,679
Clyde, I'd stay out of this if I were you.

3
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,980
This is your last morning, unless you want to spend a long time behind bars.

4
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:20,980
Mr. Crowe!

5
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:25,480
Mr. Crowe! Mr. Crowe!

6
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,480
I never laid a finger on Elise. I swear I'm done with her.

7
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,980
Let me go! Let me go!

8
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:32,479
Check him to the police station. You know what?

9
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,479
I kind of believe a thing you're saying.

10
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:36,479
Yeah, there's any more trouble with Elise.

11
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:38,479
I'm only responsible. Come on, get him out.

12
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:41,979
You got it, Crowe! Let's go! Let's go! This is your motherfucker!

13
00:00:41,979 --> 00:00:48,799
Hey, you okay?

14
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:51,799
Are you... are you not shook up from what happened?

15
00:00:51,799 --> 00:01:04,909
I mean, I was... until you came.

16
00:01:04,909 --> 00:01:07,909
Mr. Croft, you opened such a lifesaver today.

17
00:01:07,909 --> 00:01:09,909
Here, have a donut.

18
00:01:09,909 --> 00:01:12,909
No, I don't... I don't need sweets.

19
00:01:12,909 --> 00:01:19,719
Try it. You've been so helpful and kind.

20
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:21,719
And I just don't know how to repay you.

21
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:27,599
You don't have to repay me. You just be the wonderful secretary that you are.

22
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:32,599
Absolutely. I will. I'll work my butt off to make sure you're the wealthiest man on the planet.

23
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:38,299
Marriage.

24
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:39,299
Elise!
