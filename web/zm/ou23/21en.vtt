00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Mr. Croft, are you okay?

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.399
I think I hurt my arm back there.

3
00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:05.599
Oh, I didn't see you get hit.

4
00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:08.730
No, no, no. I must have twisted it up back there when I was...

5
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.130
I was taking on those guns.

6
00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:11.130
It's numb.

7
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.699
I don't think I can drive.

8
00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:16.699
You shouldn't drive. I'll get you home.

9
00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:17.699
Okay.

10
00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:18.699
We'll get to him in my car.

11
00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:20.699
No, no. I don't want to drive you, man.

12
00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:21.699
At least you could drive me.

13
00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:23.699
Mr. Croft, are you all right?

14
00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:24.699
Hey.

15
00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:26.699
Hey, don't you have a driver here?

16
00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:27.699
Yeah, but, uh...

17
00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:28.730
Hey.

18
00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.980
You got problems, right?

19
00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:31.980
Yeah.

20
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:32.979
No, yeah, yeah.

21
00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:35.979
I got a super hot date line lined up, ready to go.

22
00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:36.979
Do you really?

23
00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:39.340
Yeah, I should probably get going, actually.

24
00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.030
Let's go.

25
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.030
Thank you, man.

26
00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.140
Dude.

27
00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.140
So, date's taken, man.

28
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.140
Give me a lift.

29
00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.140
This way.

30
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.140
Thanks.
