00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Mr. Croft, we need to get you to the hospital.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,200
No, that's okay. You know, look, I rest it off.

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,759
How can you rest it off? Look, there's a pharmacy there. At least let me go get you some meds.

4
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:14,689
Actually, my hands gone. Look, got my strength back.

5
00:00:14,689 --> 00:00:23,679
Well, that's a relief. What's wrong?

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,839
You're in a hurry to go home.

7
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:29,839
Well, it's getting late and I have to get you pretty early in the morning.

8
00:00:31,179 --> 00:00:35,500
Is she really worrying about picking me up early tomorrow? Where is she more concerned about

9
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,060
what her husband will say if she's out late with a boss?

10
00:00:39,859 --> 00:00:42,820
All right then, take us back to your place.

11
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:45,840
I have to get you home first, Mr. Croft.

12
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,880
No, it's getting pretty late. I'd like to see you home safely.

13
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:03,500
Well, Mr. Croft, I am home safe. You don't have to worry about me anymore.

14
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,780
Of course, I have to worry about you because if I don't,

15
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,659
something happens to you, your husband will come after me next.

16
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:14,159
Husband? Mr. Croft, you don't mean Matt, do you?
