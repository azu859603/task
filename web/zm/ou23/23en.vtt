00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Wait, do you have more than one husband?

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I'm not married.

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.000
You're not married?

4
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I know the company's been buzzing with rumors about me, but I don't care.

5
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Damn it!

6
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Listen, from that one, I will personally deal with anybody who's spreading rumors about you.

7
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.929
So, is he not your boyfriend?

8
00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:22.929
No, he's just a good friend.

9
00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:26.929
You know, it's actually kind of hard to date when I'm always working late with you.

10
00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:29.929
Yes, so.

11
00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:33.929
Is me not being able to get a boyfriend or husband funny to you?

12
00:00:33.929 --> 00:00:34.929
No, it's not.

13
00:00:34.929 --> 00:00:36.929
Yes, it is. Look at you grinning.

14
00:00:36.929 --> 00:00:38.929
You are smiling.

15
00:00:38.929 --> 00:00:39.929
Stop it.

16
00:00:39.929 --> 00:00:42.929
You're literally smirking. You're laughing at me.

17
00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:44.929
I'm not. I'm not.

18
00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:56.570
Okay, well, you know, it's getting late.

19
00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.659
You should get some rest.

20
00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:00.659
You know what? Keep the car.

21
00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:03.189
How will you get back?

22
00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:05.189
It's fine. I'm in a good mood.

23
00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.189
I think I'll walk home.

24
00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:20.969
Goodnight, Mr. Friend.

25
00:01:23.769 --> 00:01:26.769
With this... building...

26
00:01:26.769 --> 00:01:28.769
Hell, I used to live here.
