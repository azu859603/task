1
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,460
He's taking him so long.

2
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,519
Is it a lease again?

3
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:18,679
Oh, Clyde.

4
00:00:18,679 --> 00:00:20,559
Hey, Ellie.

5
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:23,359
Look, I'm one more now.

6
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:24,600
It's getting pretty late.

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,620
I think we should get some rest, still.

8
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:29,019
One's not a wedding.

9
00:00:29,019 --> 00:00:30,300
It's giving me that.

10
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,300
Yeah.

11
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:35,340
Hey, Ellie, it's not the right timing.

12
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:41,609
OK, I'll have the other timing.

13
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:43,210
We live together.

14
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,560
For a time, I ask you to set a date.

15
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,320
You've dodged the question.

16
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:49,920
I mean, do you know how embarrassing it is

17
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,240
when everybody in my life asks me when's the wedding,

18
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,780
and I can't give them an answer?

19
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,740
Give me one more month.
