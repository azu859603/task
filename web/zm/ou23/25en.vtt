00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.940
All right, taste that.

2
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.500
I had the chef put extra sauce on it just the way I get it.

3
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.460
You know, I've been trying to make plans with you,

4
00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:14.500
but you're always too busy.

5
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.500
I know, I've just been so caught up in wedding planning.

6
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.260
You know, Clyde and I are officially

7
00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:22.780
tying the knot next month.

8
00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.640
Oh, that's wonderful.

9
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.480
Congratulations.

10
00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.049
Elise, are you genuinely happy for me?

11
00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:37.649
Why would you even ask that?

12
00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:38.929
Is it because of the rumors?

13
00:00:38.929 --> 00:00:43.659
No, I just, I value your friendship

14
00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:46.060
and I really want your blessing.

15
00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:50.710
Eleanor, I genuinely wish you and Mr. Croft

16
00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.270
a long and happy life together.

17
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.619
Okay.

18
00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:57.259
Are you gonna be my maid of honor?

19
00:00:57.259 --> 00:00:58.100
Me?

20
00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.939
Yeah.

21
00:00:58.939 --> 00:01:01.740
No, I don't think I can.

22
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:02.579
What?

23
00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:03.420
Why not?

24
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.189
We grew up together and I know it would make Clyde happy too.

25
00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:08.790
She can't be a maid of honor.
