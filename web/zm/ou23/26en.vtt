00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.129
She can't be a maid of honor.

2
00:00:04.129 --> 00:00:04.889
Clyde, what?

3
00:00:04.889 --> 00:00:05.490
Why?

4
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.370
We'll discuss this later.

5
00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:08.529
It's getting late.

6
00:00:08.529 --> 00:00:12.080
I think I should probably be.

7
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.640
Control your feelings, Elise.

8
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:46.320
He's not yours.

9
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.490
Telling me, you've fallen for Clyde, haven't you?

10
00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.369
We have been friends for so many years.

11
00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:55.170
You know I would never do that to you.

12
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.060
I know, I just need to work so close.

13
00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:07.299
How could I not worry, you know?

14
00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:10.799
And smart, and always by his side.

15
00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.870
I have many of those things.

16
00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.040
Love him.

17
00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.400
How can I not worry?

18
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.769
I promise you that I will never see him as anything

19
00:01:24.769 --> 00:01:27.900
but the love of your life.

20
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:28.900
I want to believe you.

21
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:35.620
I just, we're best friends, right?

22
00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:40.189
So for me, we just quit your job.
