1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:01,399
Come on.

2
00:00:01,399 --> 00:00:02,399
Elise, why?

3
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:03,399
Why are you resigning?

4
00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:05,240
The job is too draining.

5
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,240
I can't sleep.

6
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,480
In my mind, my body, I can't take it anymore.

7
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:10,480
Okay.

8
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,089
Hey.

9
00:00:12,089 --> 00:00:13,089
I'll lessen your workload.

10
00:00:13,089 --> 00:00:14,699
Okay.

11
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:15,699
Whatever you need.

12
00:00:15,699 --> 00:00:17,179
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:17,179 --> 00:00:18,559
I'm still quitting.

14
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:19,879
Elise.

15
00:00:19,879 --> 00:00:20,879
Come on.

16
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:21,879
We work so well together.

17
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:23,980
Why are you doing this?

18
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:25,620
Whatever it is, Elise, come on.

19
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,179
Just be honest with me.

20
00:00:27,179 --> 00:00:28,179
Mr. Croft.

21
00:00:28,179 --> 00:00:31,089
I'm really grateful for everything you've done.

22
00:00:31,089 --> 00:00:34,619
I promise I will find a way to repay you for your kindness.

23
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:35,899
Elise.

24
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:42,649
Let's just leave it at that.

25
00:00:42,649 --> 00:00:44,009
Mr. Croft, what are you doing?

26
00:00:44,009 --> 00:00:45,009
Come on.

27
00:00:45,009 --> 00:00:48,570
After everything that I've done for you, I didn't be so heartless.

28
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:49,700
Come on.

29
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:50,700
Can't you see?

30
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,500
Can't you see how I feel about you?

31
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,020
Mr. Croft, I don't know what you mean.

32
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:55,020
Come on.

33
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,619
You know damn well what I mean.

34
00:00:57,619 --> 00:00:58,619
You have a fiance.

35
00:00:58,619 --> 00:00:59,619
Okay.

36
00:00:59,619 --> 00:01:01,340
But it is a verbal agreement.

37
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:02,340
We're not really engaged.

38
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:06,409
Wasn't your plan all along to marry Eleanor?

39
00:01:06,409 --> 00:01:08,409
Are you just going to abandon her?

40
00:01:08,409 --> 00:01:09,920
Yes.

41
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,950
It was.

42
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:20,379
But I know now who I truly want and it's you.

43
00:01:20,379 --> 00:01:21,659
You just caught up in the moment.

44
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:23,739
I'm going to pretend I didn't hear any of this.

45
00:01:23,739 --> 00:01:26,260
I mean every single word of it, Elise.

46
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:27,390
Come on.

47
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:31,180
Don't you feel the same way about me?

48
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:33,900
Mr. Croft, Eleanor is my best friend.

49
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:38,459
As long as the two of you are together, I can't let you come in between us.

50
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:40,450
Okay.

51
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:41,450
Look.

52
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:42,450
I can handle it.

53
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:47,609
Find a way to make it up to her for what she did for me long ago when we were kids.

54
00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:50,090
What about her feeling?

55
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:52,209
She is overjoyed planning your wedding.

56
00:01:52,209 --> 00:01:53,409
How can you ignore that?

57
00:01:53,409 --> 00:01:54,409
I, you know, I-

58
00:01:54,409 --> 00:01:58,569
Mr. Croft, I think you need to figure out where your true feelings lie.

59
00:01:58,569 --> 00:02:27,860
Before you go making promises you can't keep.

60
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:30,370
Yeah.

61
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:31,879
This is Matt.

62
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:32,879
Get in touch with Elise.

63
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,360
I've called her like 20 times.

64
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,360
I'm worried.

65
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:47,229
Elise, where are you?

66
00:02:47,229 --> 00:02:54,550
Don't cry.

67
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,900
We fought off the bad guys, right, kiddo?

68
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:08,349
You know, when I was a little girl, I saved another boy from some bullies.

69
00:03:08,349 --> 00:03:12,789
He had this little superhero toy in his hands, and these bigger kids came up and started

70
00:03:12,789 --> 00:03:14,860
making fun of him.

71
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:19,939
He could have just handed over the toy to avoid it was coming, but he wouldn't back down.

72
00:03:19,939 --> 00:03:25,060
That's what I stepped in.

73
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:30,750
You know, like super girl, we were so close.

74
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:39,500
And on this swing set, he asked me to marry him when we grew up.

75
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:46,620
I kept my end of the promise and waited for him for two whole decades, but it turned out

76
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,500
to be nothing more than unrequited love.

77
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,110
He never showed up.

78
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:53,629
He wasn't for you.

79
00:03:53,629 --> 00:03:56,250
Well, I tried to move on.

80
00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:04,729
I even started falling for another man, but he wasn't for me either.

81
00:04:04,729 --> 00:04:07,639
He has his own Ellie, and it's not me.

82
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:11,099
I'm sorry, kiddo.

83
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:13,300
I shouldn't be telling you all this.

84
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:21,589
Just remember, superheroes always find a way to stand up again.

85
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:24,230
Superheroz always find a way to stand up again.

86
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:29,589
Wait, what did you two agree to meet?

87
00:04:29,589 --> 00:04:31,990
First encounter, bridal shot.

88
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:56,199
I finally found you.

89
00:04:56,199 --> 00:05:02,449
Ellie, I finally found you.

90
00:05:02,449 --> 00:05:06,100
You were the one that I have always wanted.

91
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,100
Just you.

92
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:19,839
And you're the only one I ever waited for.

93
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:25,040
I'm sorry, but I thought Ellen over you, because she was in a wedding dress and she had a pocket

94
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,639
watch in her hand.

95
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,600
I was confused.

96
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:34,160
So after Ellen or pretended to be me, she turned around and lied to me about the messenger

97
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,879
and breaking off the engagement and taking back the watch.

98
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:40,800
Why would she do that?

99
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,639
There's more, Mr. Croft.

100
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,040
I did some digging.

101
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:49,720
Turns out, Ellen or was behind changing the Bianchi contracts, as well as turning everybody

102
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:54,000
in the office against Elifs and Rod helped her.

103
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,040
After all these years, I never thought.

104
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,860
Thank God we caught her when we did.

105
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,259
There's enough evidence here to go to the authorities.

106
00:06:02,259 --> 00:06:04,980
No, that's letting her off too easy.

107
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,300
I want to handle this my way.

108
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,819
What are you going to do?

109
00:06:07,819 --> 00:06:11,259
She wants to marry me so badly.

110
00:06:11,259 --> 00:06:19,870
I'll give her a wedding she'll never forget.

111
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:23,350
Congratulations to the future Mrs. Croft.

112
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:25,230
The big day has finally arrived.

113
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:31,620
Oh my God, Mr. Croft is totally in love with you.

114
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:35,259
This is going to be the wedding of the century.

115
00:06:35,259 --> 00:06:39,779
With all the celebrities and media outlets here, this wedding is going to be the biggest story

116
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:44,389
for weeks.

117
00:06:44,389 --> 00:06:46,870
This was almost all yours.

118
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:50,430
I, being bad, never looked this good.

119
00:06:50,430 --> 00:07:00,110
Alright, everyone, let's have a good, warm round of applause for our bride.

120
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:01,110
Did it.

121
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:03,350
I married Clyde Croft.

122
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:07,389
You all have permission to be insanely jealous.

123
00:07:07,389 --> 00:07:13,089
Ms. Ellie, do you take Mr. Croft to be your husband?

124
00:07:13,089 --> 00:07:20,699
Mr. Croft, do you take Ms. Ellie to be your wife?

125
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:31,459
Mr. Croft, do you take Ellie to be your wife?

126
00:07:31,459 --> 00:07:34,129
He doesn't.

127
00:07:34,129 --> 00:07:35,129
What's going on?

128
00:07:35,129 --> 00:07:36,319
Who is this woman?

129
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,319
I think she's here to crash the wedding.

130
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,120
She's going to crash the wedding.

131
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,120
It's not her.

132
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,120
No, she's fine.

133
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:52,110
It's fine.

134
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:53,720
Isn't it obvious?

135
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,720
At least.

136
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,759
This is Mr. Croft, Mrs. Croft's wedding, and now you choose to show up and try to steal

137
00:07:58,759 --> 00:07:59,759
the spotlight.

138
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,540
Are you out of your mind?

139
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,100
I know what I'm doing.

140
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:08,069
I'm here to fight for Mr. Croft, and our love.

141
00:08:08,069 --> 00:08:10,470
Go ahead and hit me in front of all these people.

142
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:17,009
He's ruining our wedding.

143
00:08:17,009 --> 00:08:18,009
Everybody is watching.

144
00:08:18,009 --> 00:08:19,360
All out.

145
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,470
I'll handle it.

146
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:25,329
Everyone, I have a very important announcement to make.

147
00:08:25,329 --> 00:08:29,509
I'd like to formally introduce you all to my bride.

148
00:08:29,589 --> 00:08:37,720
At least, if you think you can steal him away at our wedding, you are way out of your depth.

149
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,559
I wouldn't be so sure.

150
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:43,159
And my bride?

151
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,159
My bride?

152
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:48,580
At least.

153
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:49,580
Look at this.

154
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:50,649
Stop.

155
00:08:50,649 --> 00:09:00,029
Stop.

156
00:09:00,029 --> 00:09:03,740
At least, you're the joy of my life.

157
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:07,659
Will you make me the happiest man in the world and marry me?

158
00:09:07,659 --> 00:09:09,659
Yes, I will.

159
00:09:09,659 --> 00:09:18,840
Clyde, what the hell is going on?

160
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,320
Isn't it obvious?

161
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,960
Clyde's marrying me.

162
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,250
No.

163
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:25,129
No, this isn't happening.

164
00:09:25,129 --> 00:09:26,289
This is a joke, right, Clyde?

165
00:09:26,289 --> 00:09:27,289
I'm not joking.

166
00:09:27,289 --> 00:09:29,490
At least it's my one true love.

167
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:31,799
I don't believe that.

168
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:33,480
Clyde, you made me a promise.

169
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,220
You said you would marry me.

170
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,820
I saved you from those bullies.

171
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,230
Stop.

172
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:41,070
At least it's the one who saved me 20 years ago, not you.

173
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:43,549
What nonsense is at least telling you now?

174
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:44,710
Don't listen to her lies.

175
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:45,870
I'm the one who saved you.

176
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:46,870
It was me.

177
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:49,309
Enough with the lies, Eleanor.

178
00:09:49,309 --> 00:10:00,350
Friends, don't need this to be.

179
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,409
Still sticking to your story, huh?

180
00:10:02,409 --> 00:10:07,289
If you're the one who saved Clyde all those years ago, then tell me when, where, how you

181
00:10:07,289 --> 00:10:08,289
didn't.

182
00:10:08,289 --> 00:10:09,289
I don't remember.

183
00:10:09,289 --> 00:10:10,289
It was 20 years ago.

184
00:10:10,289 --> 00:10:11,289
What?

185
00:10:11,289 --> 00:10:12,289
How am I supposed to remember the stupid little details?

186
00:10:12,289 --> 00:10:13,289
All right.

187
00:10:13,289 --> 00:10:16,049
Then do you have any proof that you're the one who saved Clyde?

188
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:17,610
Of course.

189
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:18,929
The pocket watches.

190
00:10:18,929 --> 00:10:19,929
We both have one.

191
00:10:19,929 --> 00:10:20,929
You gave it to me?

192
00:10:20,929 --> 00:10:21,929
I mean these.

193
00:10:21,929 --> 00:10:22,929
Exactly.

194
00:10:22,929 --> 00:10:25,080
There's pictures of us as kids inside?

195
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:40,960
Well, how come this girl looks nothing like you?

196
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,960
Besties.

197
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,960
Don't you?

198
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:46,460
Bestie me.

199
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,460
I'm so cold.

200
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,740
I'm still acting innocent after everything you've done.

201
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,299
What are you talking about?

202
00:10:51,299 --> 00:10:52,299
All right.

203
00:10:52,299 --> 00:10:55,360
You want to stick to your story fine?

204
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,919
Everyone, check your phones.

205
00:10:56,919 --> 00:11:00,259
A video has just been sent to you.

206
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:01,259
Are you serious?

207
00:11:01,259 --> 00:11:08,809
Gather your best men, and when she's off work, we'll teach her a lesson.

208
00:11:08,809 --> 00:11:09,809
Wow.

209
00:11:09,809 --> 00:11:11,129
What viciousness.

210
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:12,690
What an amazing term you do.

211
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:13,690
This is crazy.

212
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:15,169
No.

213
00:11:15,169 --> 00:11:16,169
No, no, no.

214
00:11:16,169 --> 00:11:17,169
That's a lie.

215
00:11:17,169 --> 00:11:18,169
It's fake.

216
00:11:18,169 --> 00:11:19,169
It's AI.

217
00:11:19,169 --> 00:11:21,259
Need more proof?

218
00:11:21,259 --> 00:11:27,120
Take a look.

219
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,120
This has to go viral.

220
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:33,919
No.

221
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:34,919
Off of me.

222
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:35,919
Let go.

223
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:36,919
Take her to jail.

224
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:37,919
Elise, please.

225
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:38,919
Please don't do this after all we've been through.

226
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:39,919
Well, then we've been through.

227
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:40,980
How dare you?

228
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:43,429
That is nothing compared to what you put me.

229
00:11:43,429 --> 00:11:45,429
Elise, I'm sorry.

230
00:11:45,429 --> 00:11:46,429
Okay.

231
00:11:46,429 --> 00:11:47,429
I was wrong.

232
00:11:47,429 --> 00:11:48,590
I made a mistake.

233
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:49,590
Just please.

234
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:51,230
Get her out of here.

235
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:52,230
No.

236
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:53,230
Please.

237
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,230
