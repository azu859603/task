Patrick always said his sister was a rebel, but I did not expect this pretending to be poor, huh?

2
00:00:06.469 --> 00:00:12.470
Didn't think I'd get cuffed myself. Oh, well, at least now I don't need to deal with my so-called fiance.

3
00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:20.350
Thanks for letting me crash for the week. I don't really have a place to stay right now. Wait. No, I don't remember inviting you to stay.

4
00:00:20.469 --> 00:00:28.960
Oh, it looks good on you.

5
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.629
You sure you don't have any of the clues?

6
00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:32.950
Nope.

7
00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:34.950
But we can get you something tomorrow.

8
00:00:35.429 --> 00:00:39.390
Okay, um, next question. How are we going to sleep?

9
00:00:39.390 --> 00:01:03.070
It's happening. Why is he staring at me?

10
00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.099
When do you plan to get off me?
