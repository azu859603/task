1
00:00:03,859 --> 00:00:08,070
Yeah, this place is way expensive.

2
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:12,820
We should probably go somewhere else.

3
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:15,460
You didn't close your eyes this time.

4
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:18,379
No, I didn't.

5
00:00:18,379 --> 00:00:21,170
Is this expensive?

6
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:23,329
Of course it is.

7
00:00:23,329 --> 00:00:26,289
You couldn't even afford that if you sold your to the kidneys.

8
00:00:26,289 --> 00:00:31,730
Yeah, I didn't know they allowed people who shopped at Goodwill in here.

9
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:33,409
No wonder Dan dumped you.

10
00:00:33,409 --> 00:00:34,289
She's right.

11
00:00:34,289 --> 00:00:35,729
You look like a homeless person.

12
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:38,210
This place is way out of your budget.

13
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:39,969
Actually, I think we'll stay.

14
00:00:39,969 --> 00:00:40,929
Thanks.

15
00:00:40,929 --> 00:00:44,640
Right, Phillip?

16
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,789
Wow.

17
00:00:45,789 --> 00:00:48,189
You sure do move fast, don't you?

18
00:00:48,189 --> 00:00:52,750
Not even two days after breaking up and you're already handcuffed to this loser.

19
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,189
Shut the hell up, Dan.

20
00:00:54,189 --> 00:00:56,909
You still have some of your baby teeth.

21
00:00:56,909 --> 00:01:00,350
Ellie did say her ex was the biggest mistake of her life.

22
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:01,789
Seems like she was right.
