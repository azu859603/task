Wow Ellie, it seems that you two sure are meant for each other.

2
00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:09.390
He's pathetic.

3
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:14.429
Is that so?

4
00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.429
Miss, please feel free to choose whatever you like.

5
00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:20.429
It is an honor to serve a customer like you.

6
00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:22.329
Are you kidding?

7
00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:23.329
An honor?

8
00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:25.329
You can't even afford Kroger.

9
00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:26.329
No.

10
00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:29.329
Let's just go upstairs and get away from this filthy.

11
00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:31.329
I would like nothing more.

12
00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:40.759
I'm sorry, but you cannot go upstairs.

13
00:00:40.759 --> 00:00:43.759
You can't, but those losers can?

14
00:00:43.759 --> 00:00:45.759
I'm a VIP member.

15
00:00:45.759 --> 00:00:46.759
VIP doesn't matter.

16
00:00:46.759 --> 00:00:49.759
Those two are our important guests.

17
00:00:49.759 --> 00:00:52.759
If anybody's in nobody here, it's you two.

18
00:00:52.759 --> 00:00:53.759
Security!

19
00:00:53.759 --> 00:00:55.759
Throw these two out.

20
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.480
Who are you, really?
