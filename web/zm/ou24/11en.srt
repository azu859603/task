1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Do you have any idea you were messing with?

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:09,000
Apologize now. Do you think a simple apology is enough? No, you should be begging for my forgiveness in your dreams

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,320
Give me the manager now

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:15,599
Where the hell is security? How can I help you guys out? Don't worry. I got this

5
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:19,750
Get these two cockroaches out of my sight. Take us out

6
00:00:20,269 --> 00:00:27,600
You think you have that authority miss what seems to be the problem? These two do not belong here and I want them gone. Mr

7
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,619
Miss mr. Wesley my my sincerest apologies

8
00:00:34,179 --> 00:00:42,689
At least boyfriend is a Wesley as in the Wesley group. Is it this restaurant owned by the Wesley group?

9
00:00:43,329 --> 00:00:50,950
Could could he be? No, there's no way the Wesley air grew up abroad and I heard he's hideous

10
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:53,710
Why bail on the engagement?

11
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:56,119
He can't possibly be the Wesley air

12
00:00:56,359 --> 00:01:01,920
So she's the woman my mom forced me to get married with and she bailed on that engagement because of some rumors

13
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:04,569
Good ingredients

14
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:06,569
Throw them out
