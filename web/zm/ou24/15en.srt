1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
So she applied to the Wesley group.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:04,000
Is this a job?

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,500
Do you have any idea how hard it is to get into the Wesley group?

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,000
It's one of the top companies in the world.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
That's not been special.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,689
I'm sure you're young and good at what you do now,

7
00:00:14,689 --> 00:00:19,190
but what happens when you're old and fat and you're losing your teeth and hair?

8
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:21,190
I'll need a real job eventually.

9
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:24,190
What exactly do you think I do for a living?

10
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:49,799
Mr. Wesley, everything is set for your official CEO appointments, sir.

11
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:51,799
Do you plan to attend in person?

12
00:00:51,799 --> 00:00:53,799
I'll be there.
