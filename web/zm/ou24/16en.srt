00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:06,129
Sorry Philip, I've been really busy recently, forgot to call you back.

2
00:00:06,129 --> 00:00:08,630
Turns out that Ellie ran off of Braun a while ago.

3
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:10,130
Your sister went abroad?

4
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:17,489
Yeah, the very day you came back. She didn't even show up at the bar.

5
00:00:17,489 --> 00:00:20,489
Your sister's name is Ellie, right?

6
00:00:20,489 --> 00:00:25,019
That's right.

7
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:33,859
Could she have been pretending to be Ellie Murphy this whole time?

8
00:00:33,859 --> 00:00:41,159
Give me a file on the new hires of the company. I need details on an Ellie Murphy.

9
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:44,159
Leslie Graham really lives up to its reputation.

10
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:45,259
Impressive.

11
00:00:45,259 --> 00:00:49,259
I heard today's the first day for the mostly heir, a CEO.

12
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:51,259
Wonderful, get lucky enough to see him.

13
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:53,259
Oh my God, don't get too excited.

14
00:00:53,259 --> 00:00:58,259
Rumor has it the hot words cancel their engagement because he's a hideous.

15
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:00,640
CEO?

16
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:06,349
It's you.

17
00:01:06,349 --> 00:01:11,349
Mr. Wesley, there's no Ellie Murphy among the new hires, but there is an Ellie Harper.

18
00:01:11,349 --> 00:01:14,859
Ellie Harper.

19
00:01:14,859 --> 00:01:18,859
I'm a sticker for someone else, so she wasn't pretending to be poor.

20
00:01:18,859 --> 00:01:21,859
Then what did she think I was?

21
00:01:21,859 --> 00:01:24,859
You took my advice and got a proper job?

22
00:01:24,859 --> 00:01:27,859
The CEO's coming.

23
00:01:27,859 --> 00:01:28,859
You quiet.

24
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:29,859
Ellie.
