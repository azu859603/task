00:00:01.169 --> 00:00:04.450
Your heart's racing.

2
00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:07.410
Um, I have to run.

3
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.699
Be careful, I heard the CEOs apparently like a giant pervert or something.

4
00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:16.100
You might want to avoid him.

5
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.100
Me a pervert.

6
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.170
Uh, I guess I'll avoid myself.

7
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:27.960
Is it nobody with no background?

8
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.960
Why are you even here?

9
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.960
The CEO specifically requested your resume yesterday.

10
00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:33.960
What?

11
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.960
Did you sleep your way through the back door?

12
00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:36.960
I didn't sleep with anybody.

13
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.960
I earned my spot fair and square.

14
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.090
With interviews and hard work.

15
00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:44.119
And LinkedIn.

16
00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:49.119
Your first day on the job and you're already mouthing off to me, I can fire you right now.

17
00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:51.219
Yeah, and I can report you to HR.

18
00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:55.619
I am HR.

19
00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:58.619
You don't know how things work around here, do you?

20
00:00:58.619 --> 00:01:01.619
Well, I don't think bullying is in the employee handbook.

21
00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:03.619
You want to be bullied?

22
00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:04.620
Fine.
