1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,549
Uh, uh, what?

2
00:00:03,549 --> 00:00:06,549
Me? A CEO mistaken for a callboy?

3
00:00:06,549 --> 00:00:09,869
A high-end one?

4
00:00:09,869 --> 00:00:13,890
Who's in here?

5
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:15,890
How much do I owe you?

6
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:21,989
I don't need a real job eventually.

7
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:29,980
I've been told if you want to break off the engagement,

8
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:32,979
you should do it in person with Miss Howard at tomorrow's party.

9
00:00:32,979 --> 00:00:33,979
Noted.

10
00:00:33,979 --> 00:00:37,299
Why are you sitting so far away?

11
00:00:37,299 --> 00:00:39,299
I have a surprise for you.

12
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:44,460
Come in.

13
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,460
Good evening, Miss Harper.
