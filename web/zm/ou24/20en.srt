1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:06,980
I thought you said you like cold boys.

2
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:09,980
Mr. Wesley, I think you understood me. I'm not.

3
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:13,009
None of them catch your eye?

4
00:00:13,009 --> 00:00:15,009
I'm sorry I thought that about you.

5
00:00:15,009 --> 00:00:22,280
Please don't compare me.

6
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,280
You said you'd do anything?

7
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,859
Well, not anything.

8
00:00:26,859 --> 00:00:33,429
What's going on in the head of yours?

9
00:00:33,429 --> 00:00:39,350
I'm now on a steer clear of places like this,

10
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:42,350
and I'm working on cold boys. Got it?

11
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:45,350
I swear I'll never do it again.

12
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:49,350
It's not like I even called for them in the first place.

13
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:53,350
Actually, I do have a favor to ask.

14
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:55,350
Okay. What is it?
