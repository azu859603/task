Ellie, if you can't afford a designer dress, don't try to fool everyone with a knock-off, it's sad!

2
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:14.470
Someone's wearing the same dress as Miss Howard at her own party!

3
00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:21.940
It's obvious Miss Howard's wearing the real deal. Clearly that other girl can't afford it.

4
00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:28.940
How can you be so sure mine's fake? If you ask me, yours looks like the fake. Look at the neckline, there's loose threads.

5
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.939
Bullshit, your broke as hell. So what are you going to afford a real dress?

6
00:00:33.939 --> 00:00:40.939
My boyfriend's loaded, so you can snag a rich girl, but I can't find a wealthy handsome man.

7
00:00:40.939 --> 00:00:48.229
Just admit it's a fake ass dress, for you fool yourself in front of everybody. Take it off!

8
00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:51.229
It's the real deal, Joanna, yours is fake.

9
00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:56.649
Somebody get the designer, but you didn't see that come into Kelly.

10
00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:01.649
The designer of this dress is at this party. Let's see you try and talk your way out of this one.

11
00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.650
You know what, baby? I don't think she's worth her time. How about we could just get going?

12
00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.650
What's wrong, damn? Are you still holding up on your ex?

13
00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.650
No, babe, of course not. Just, you know, let them talk.

14
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:24.319
Hmm, yes, yes. Interesting.

15
00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:32.659
Oh, shoddy crafts. This dress is a fake.
