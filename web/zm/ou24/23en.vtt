00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
What?

2
00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.600
Mrs. Howard is where you'll knock off?

3
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.000
I can't believe it.

4
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
That's a world renowned designer.

5
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.029
He wouldn't know.

6
00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:10.029
That's impossible.

7
00:00:10.029 --> 00:00:12.029
There's no way my dress is the fate.

8
00:00:12.029 --> 00:00:16.030
To think a Howard would buy a counterfeit.

9
00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:19.030
I will never send you one of my designs ever again.

10
00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:21.219
But the disgrace.

11
00:00:21.219 --> 00:00:22.929
Dan?

12
00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:24.929
Explain yourself.

13
00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:25.929
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:27.929
I gave you the money for this dress.

15
00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:29.929
I wasn't thinking straight.

16
00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:31.929
It's just a dress you're just going to wear once.

17
00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:33.929
Why you spent thousands of dollars on that?

18
00:00:33.929 --> 00:00:34.929
I mean, it's not worth it.

19
00:00:34.929 --> 00:00:36.960
You bastard!

20
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.960
You pocketed my money?

21
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.960
You said I should take off the dress if it was fake.

22
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.960
But now that it's clear you're dressed as fake, you should take it off, right?

23
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.960
Don't think that by wearing a designer gown, you're suddenly high class.

24
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.960
I am Eris, who declined the Wesley family's marriage proposal.

25
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.960
Who do you think you are?

26
00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.960
Wait, isn't that Mr. Wesley?

27
00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.960
Mr. Wesley's here?

28
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.960
His fiance, his Howard, is being humiliated.

29
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.959
Why isn't he helping?

30
00:01:05.959 --> 00:01:08.150
Mr. Wesley?
