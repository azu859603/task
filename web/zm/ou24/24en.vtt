1
00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.109
That's impossible.

2
00:00:02.109 --> 00:00:05.509
Mr. Wesley is supposed to be a disgusting fat pig.

3
00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:06.349
How?

4
00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:07.589
Is he still handsome?

5
00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:08.390
I don't know.

6
00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:10.830
I was surprised, too.

7
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.429
Ellie is hooking up with the CEO of the Wesley group.

8
00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:18.829
I never intended to marry you, Joanna.

9
00:00:18.829 --> 00:00:21.789
The engagement between the Wesley and the Howard families

10
00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:24.100
is never going to happen.

11
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.089
He's the CEO of the Wesley group.

12
00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:30.489
Is this a public breakup?

13
00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:33.770
Ms. Howard is wearing the knockoff.

14
00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.600
The winner doesn't want her.

15
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.479
Talk shit about my girlfriend again.

16
00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:42.979
Let's see what happens.

17
00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:44.619
Have a nice night.

18
00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:48.530
Oh.

19
00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.740
What are y'all looking at?

20
00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.299
No, please don't.

21
00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:54.859
Get out of here, you loser.

22
00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:56.579
You pocketed it with my dress money.

23
00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.740
It made me look like a fool in front of everyone.

24
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.219
We are Thoreau.

25
00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:01.100
Let me make it up to you.

26
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.069
I'm not sorry.

27
00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.829
If it wasn't for you and your stupid ex,

28
00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:14.480
I would be Mrs. Wesley by now.

29
00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.109
I'll get what's mine.

30
00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:22.200
Whatever it takes.

31
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.599
Mr. Wesley, I...

32
00:01:23.599 --> 00:01:26.349
Be in time for work tomorrow.

33
00:01:26.349 --> 00:01:28.750
So you're not firing me?

34
00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:29.750
That's great.
