Sorry, Mr. Wesley. I can't suddenly jump in front of the... car.

2
00:00:09,429 --> 00:00:12,429
Oh my god. Did I just kiss the CEO?

3
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:16,559
Did I ever say I was gonna fire you?

4
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:22,070
No, I just thought you might fire me because of all the drama.

5
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:28,910
Just... don't be late for work tomorrow.

6
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:48,829
Why are you waiting for me, huh?
