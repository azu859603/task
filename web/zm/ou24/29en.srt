1
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:02,870
Fill up.

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:05,000
What's so urgent?

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
When are you finally getting married?

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Mother, I already told you that's my personal business.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Don't try to fool me.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,449
If you don't bring me home a daughter-in-law this week,

7
00:00:17,449 --> 00:00:19,449
I'm going to disown you.

8
00:00:19,449 --> 00:00:33,520
Married in a week.

9
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,520
The CEO's been coming to this department a lot lately.

10
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,520
All thanks to you, Director.

11
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,520
Oh, it looks like somebody's online for a promotion.

12
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,520
Let's keep it together. Let's keep it low-key.

13
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,710
We're having a team dinner tonight.

14
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:52,219
Didn't expect it to be so boring.

15
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:53,219
Don't party too hard.

16
00:00:53,219 --> 00:01:00,700
What are you doing over here all by yourself?

17
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,700
It's a party, can't you see that?

18
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:07,299
You know, I've always seen your potential.

19
00:01:07,299 --> 00:01:11,170
It's the first day that I hired you.

20
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:15,420
Who do we discuss your future in private?

21
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:20,659
People look around. It's a party.

22
00:01:20,659 --> 00:01:26,719
I appreciate the offer, but I prefer to keep things professional.

23
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:29,719
Are you seriously turning down a one-on-one with the director right now?

24
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:31,719
Come on, Ellie. Don't be such a buzzkill.

25
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:33,719
He's trying to help your career.

26
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:35,719
Guys, guys, guys.

27
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:37,980
Don't pressure, Ellie.

28
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:41,010
If she doesn't want some career advice, that's okay.

29
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:43,010
I can handle a little rejection.

30
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:46,140
But please, Ellie, stick around.

31
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,170
Have a drink.

32
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:50,299
Show a little team spirit, huh?
