00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
All he does is gamble. My whole life.

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.769
He's only come to me for money, and if I refuse, he threatens me with my sister.

3
00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:13.769
She's so stubborn. If I just gave her the money, she'd definitely refuse.

4
00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:21.960
Let's make a deal. You need $300,000 and I need someone to marry to appease my family.

5
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.940
Let's get married.

6
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.940
You and me. Get married?

7
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.179
Madam.

8
00:00:33.179 --> 00:00:34.179
Yes.

9
00:00:34.179 --> 00:00:35.179
Miss Howard is here.

10
00:00:35.179 --> 00:00:39.030
Miss Howard.

11
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.030
Gloria.

12
00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:48.090
I came here to apologize. It was wrong of me to break off the engagement like that.

13
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:55.250
I brought you a red brush. I had my friend bring it all the way from Italy. I thought it would suit you perfectly.

14
00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.250
How kind of you?

15
00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:02.859
Please take a seat, darling.

16
00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:11.200
Oh, it's a shame you and Philip didn't work out.

17
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:17.379
Gloria, breaking off the engagement wasn't really my idea.

18
00:01:17.379 --> 00:01:21.540
Do you think Philip has any new engagement plans?

19
00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:31.599
No, he does not. Joanna, are you saying that you may reconsider marrying him?

20
00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:39.099
But do you think Philip would be willing?
