1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:05,690
Whether he's willing or not, it is not to him.

2
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:07,690
I'll make the decision.

3
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:13,419
Gloria, I would like to work at the Wesley group.

4
00:00:13,419 --> 00:00:17,420
Get closer to Philip, spend more time with him.

5
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:25,609
Good idea. You young people need more time to build a connection before talking about marriage.

6
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:29,179
I was too hasty.

7
00:00:29,179 --> 00:00:32,469
Ellie, I won't let you succeed.

8
00:00:32,469 --> 00:00:34,469
Philip is mine.

9
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:38,909
Can't believe I just married the CEO.

10
00:00:38,909 --> 00:00:43,039
Why not? Is it so hard to believe?

11
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:48,259
Mr. Wesley, I'll pay you back to 300,000. I know this is just a marriage of convenience.

12
00:00:48,259 --> 00:00:50,259
We won't interfere in each other's lives.

13
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:54,259
And if you want to end the marriage at any time, we can come back and get a divorce.

14
00:00:54,259 --> 00:00:57,259
I won't go tell people on your wife enough.

15
00:00:57,259 --> 00:00:59,840
I won't cause you any trouble.

16
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,840
Mr. Wesley?

17
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,510
Mrs. Wesley.

18
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:10,340
Are we really that distant that we are talking about a divorce right after we get married?

19
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:15,680
Okay. Baby.

20
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:24,430
Joanna came by today.

21
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:26,430
Oh, did she?

22
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:29,430
Yes. What's going on between the two of you?

23
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,430
Joanna really likes you.

24
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:37,629
When exactly do you plan on getting married?

25
00:01:37,629 --> 00:01:38,629
I'm already married.
