00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:08.060
Married? Who's the girl? And why didn't you tell me earlier?

2
00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.380
I'll bring you home in a few days.

3
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.380
Good. I won't meddle anymore.

4
00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.380
You're married. That's all that matters.

5
00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:24.730
Are you off work? You need a ride.

6
00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.460
Well, well, I dear Ellie.

7
00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.460
Dad, how did you find out where I work?

8
00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.460
Oh, well, you can thank your ex-boyfriend for that.

9
00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.460
I mean, if it wasn't for him, I never would have found you.

10
00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:37.460
What do you want?

11
00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.740
What do you think, everyone?

12
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:41.740
Give me my damn money.

13
00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.740
I already gave you $300,000 that wasn't that long ago,

14
00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.740
and I don't have any more money.

15
00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.740
We both know you can pour yourself out for some more.

16
00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.740
Give me my money!

17
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.840
Do what I say!
