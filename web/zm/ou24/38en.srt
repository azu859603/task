1
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,759
Are you deaf?

2
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,560
I'm speaking to you.

3
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,560
You're fired.

4
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,600
Pat your crap and get out.

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,039
Well, first of all, I'm not a home wrecker.

6
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:24,839
Second, I did not leak company secrets.

7
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:27,800
Well, we got an anonymous tip last night

8
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,239
that our competitors' internal data matches ours completely.

9
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:33,280
So why are you denying it?

10
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,320
How could you be so sure I'm the one who leaked it?

11
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,960
Couldn't it have been you?

12
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,039
What the hell is going on?

13
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:43,399
She is Mr. Wesley's fiance.

14
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:45,920
How dare you accuse her?

15
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,320
A home wrecker with such nerve.

16
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,109
I mean, how the hell did you even get hired here?

17
00:00:52,109 --> 00:00:54,219
I said you're fired.

18
00:00:54,219 --> 00:00:56,259
Pack up your stuff and leave.

19
00:00:56,259 --> 00:01:02,840
And if you don't go now, you'll end up behind bars.

20
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:06,609
I stole your boyfriend once, and I can do it again.

21
00:01:06,609 --> 00:01:07,810
You're no match for me.

22
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:09,609
You have no shame.

23
00:01:09,609 --> 00:01:14,609
Ellie's acting crazy.

24
00:01:14,609 --> 00:01:18,209
You should just act with me in front of these colleagues.
