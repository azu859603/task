1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
What do you think you're doing?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,450
Bullying Ellie?

3
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:06,450
Go hand in your resignation to HR.

4
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,220
All of you.

5
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:10,220
Now!

6
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:12,699
Mr. Wesley, you don't understand.

7
00:00:12,699 --> 00:00:14,699
Is she really just company secrets?

8
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:16,699
You're just going to let that slide?

9
00:00:16,699 --> 00:00:17,699
Oh.

10
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:21,699
Are you suggesting my wife is helping our competitors?

11
00:00:21,699 --> 00:00:25,649
Wife?

12
00:00:25,649 --> 00:00:27,129
Oh.

13
00:00:27,129 --> 00:00:29,129
Did I hear that right?

14
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:32,130
The CEO just said Ellie is his wife.

15
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,130
The CEO's wife?

16
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:35,130
Oh, my God.

17
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:36,479
Oh, my God.

18
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:41,479
If it turns out Ellie had nothing to do with these stolen secrets

19
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:45,670
and you're the one behind this whole setup, Joanna,

20
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:48,670
I'll make sure the entire Howard family pays.

21
00:00:48,670 --> 00:01:04,219
Don't worry, Ellie, I'll clear your name from Christmas.

22
00:01:04,219 --> 00:01:07,430
You knew this would happen, didn't you?
