00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:02.859
What do you mean?

2
00:00:02.859 --> 00:00:05.660
When you found out Joanna got a job here,

3
00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.240
you must have known it was to get to you and me.

4
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.439
And now that you have a reason to kick Joanna out of Wesley Group,

5
00:00:12.439 --> 00:00:16.190
you can take over the Howard Village project.

6
00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:18.550
Very impressive, Mr. Wesley.

7
00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:25.019
My mother planted her in the company.

8
00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:31.550
I guess I just needed a reason to fire her.

9
00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.030
That's a bit devious, Mr. Wesley, don't you think?

10
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.030
I didn't know you were being bullied at work.

11
00:00:39.109 --> 00:00:42.700
Why didn't you tell me?

12
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.170
It's whatever, I don't care.

13
00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.090
Well, I do.

14
00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:52.219
Is that why you made it public and announced to everyone on your wife?

15
00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:59.420
It's about time everybody knows.

16
00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.780
Joanna told me everything about the woman you married

17
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.709
is from a shady past and her morals are even worse.

18
00:01:08.709 --> 00:01:12.750
You have to divorce her immediately.

19
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.689
Don't be so hasty, mother.

20
00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.109
You're about to see quite a show.

21
00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:22.430
Madam, the Howard's are here.
