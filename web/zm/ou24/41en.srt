1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,740
Apologize now!

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:05,940
What's going on here, Joanna?

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:07,940
What happened?

4
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:09,939
Philip explained this.

5
00:00:09,939 --> 00:00:12,939
Mr. Wesley, Joanna's guilty.

6
00:00:12,939 --> 00:00:17,000
She stole the Wesley groups' confidential information.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Gave it to another company.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
But I brought her here to apologize in front of you.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
How could you, Gloria?

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
It's all a big misunderstanding.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Mr. Wesley, you and I, as you know,

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
we've worked together a lot before.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Please have mercy.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,100
Interesting how your daughter doesn't seem to be the least bit remorseful.

15
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,100
I mean, even now, she says this is a misunderstanding.

16
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,100
I... I...

17
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,100
Workplace bullying.

18
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,100
Miss Treating new employees.

19
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,100
Accusing others of stealing company assets.

20
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,090
What seems to be the misunderstanding?

21
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,090
Jo!

22
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:57,090
How could you do this?

23
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,570
This talk of it.

24
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:01,570
It will matter to educate it.

25
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:05,230
It was all an act.

26
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:09,489
I did think I... I considered you to be my daughter-in-law.

27
00:01:09,489 --> 00:01:14,909
I never would have seen you again.
