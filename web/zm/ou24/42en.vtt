00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.219
Mr. Wesley, I will make sure that you learn the lesson, okay?

2
00:00:05.219 --> 00:00:07.719
Please have mercy. Please.

3
00:00:07.719 --> 00:00:16.230
If this happens again, I won't be so forgiving.

4
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.230
Don't you see now?

5
00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.230
This is the daughter-in-law you so carefully chose from me.

6
00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.260
I just wanted you to marry someone from a respectable family.

7
00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.760
Girl I'm married is actually quite nice.

8
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.260
You should meet her.

9
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.979
I believe it.

10
00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:35.979
If girls from one-law families can't be trusted,

11
00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:37.479
how can she be any better?

12
00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:40.960
How can you judge her without even meeting her?

13
00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.640
Fine. I'll meet her.

14
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:56.679
Are you happy? She better not disappoint me.

15
00:00:56.679 --> 00:00:58.679
Joanna, stop this nonsense.

16
00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:01.179
We can't afford to mess with the Westerners.

17
00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:03.240
I am not giving up any of them.

18
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.739
Then what do you want to do?

19
00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:28.180
In ones that Ellie had a gambling, alcoholic addict and a father.

20
00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:29.709
Yes, what about it?

21
00:01:29.709 --> 00:01:32.640
Do you have his contact information?

22
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.849
I need you to do something.

23
00:01:35.849 --> 00:01:36.849
And who else?

24
00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:40.980
If you do a good job, I might consider getting-
