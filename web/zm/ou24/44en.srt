1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Ah, look everyone, it's Ms. Wesley, my daughter.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
She won't even call me Dad when she sees me.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Stop this nonsense, whatever this is.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We can talk about it privately.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
You think I'm stupid?

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
You're just afraid I'm gonna make a scene and ruin your reputation as Mrs. Wesley.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Isn't that it, huh? No, no.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Let's talk about it here and now.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
She always seemed so kind.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Turns out it's just an act.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
She won't even acknowledge her own father.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Guess she really just wanted to marry Rich.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,030
Enough. You just want my money? I've given you everything I have?

14
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:44,289
What more do you want from me?

15
00:00:44,289 --> 00:00:47,740
You know, damn well, why don't want to see you?

16
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:51,740
What's wrong with the daughter providing for her father?

17
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:54,740
I mean, if you don't have the money, Philip does.

18
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:56,740
I mean, just ask him for it.

19
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:59,740
Please, Philip's money has to do with you.

20
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:02,740
I'm not gonna ask him for money to fund your gambling addiction.

21
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,739
You've never been a good father to me.

22
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:07,409
Why should I help you?

23
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:10,409
All my life, you've done nothing but treat me like shit.

24
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:15,010
You've even tried to sell me to an old man.

25
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:20,680
You want a grateful child spewing such lies.

26
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,260
You've pushed me the edge.

27
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:26,859
I no longer want to live.

28
00:01:26,859 --> 00:01:28,859
How could you do this to your father?

29
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:33,010
You're not even her biological father, though.

30
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:35,810
How are you?
