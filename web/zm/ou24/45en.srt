1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:07,820
Oh, so you must be my son-in-law.

2
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:11,009
Well, quite the catch.

3
00:00:11,009 --> 00:00:13,169
You know, Ellie won't be.

4
00:00:13,169 --> 00:00:16,059
Yeah, I cut the act.

5
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:18,059
You don't share a single drop of blood with Ellie.

6
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:20,289
You're just a parasite.

7
00:00:20,289 --> 00:00:21,379
What are you saying?

8
00:00:21,379 --> 00:00:26,329
We handle this.

9
00:00:26,329 --> 00:00:28,329
How the hell did you...

10
00:00:28,329 --> 00:00:29,329
Security.

11
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:32,490
You get this piece of shit out of here.

12
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:33,490
Guys, no.

13
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:34,490
No!

14
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:36,490
Ellie, no!

15
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:37,490
Listen!

16
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:38,490
Listen!

17
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:47,500
I need my malle, I need my money!

18
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,500
Brian was a heavy drinker and gambler in his early days.

19
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,100
Ever even married.

20
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:58,740
You and your sister were abandoned and articulate.

21
00:00:58,740 --> 00:00:59,740
I should not.

22
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:03,509
No matter how hard I try to, you always hated me.

23
00:01:03,509 --> 00:01:11,340
Sorry for causing you so much trouble.

24
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,719
I'm here now.

25
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:17,200
I will not let anyone hurt you ever again.

26
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:31,549
Is this how you greet people now?
