1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
How dare you hit me?

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,599
Oh yeah, I got a juicy headline you guys have been waiting for.

3
00:00:06,599 --> 00:00:10,759
The wife of the Wesley group's CEO is nothing but a conniving home wrecker.

4
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:13,759
Ms. Hopper, is it true that you slept your way to the top?

5
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:16,760
The Wesley's were set to marry into the Howard family twice.

6
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:21,019
How did you manage to steal away Mr. Wesley against Joanna?

7
00:00:21,019 --> 00:00:24,019
Answer us. Did you know you become the home wrecker?

8
00:00:24,019 --> 00:00:25,019
That's not.

9
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:27,019
The reporters are all on my side.

10
00:00:27,019 --> 00:00:29,019
Welcome to your public disgrace.

11
00:00:29,019 --> 00:00:40,149
Mrs. Wesley, there is trouble at the company.

12
00:00:40,149 --> 00:00:41,149
What is it?

13
00:00:41,149 --> 00:00:46,500
It appears that the young Mrs. Wesley is involved in some sort of scandal.

14
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,500
The company's stock has been plummeting since this morning.

15
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,500
Contact filled immediately.

16
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,500
I don't care who it is that he married. Tell him to divorce her.

17
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,500
Yes ma'am.

18
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:05,299
It's her.

19
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:07,299
Okay, let's take you to the clinic.

20
00:01:07,299 --> 00:01:12,299
So that's the one that he married.
