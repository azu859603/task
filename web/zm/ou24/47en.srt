1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,060
Let me make this crystal clear.

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:03,899
Ellie is my wife.

3
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:07,259
Any further slander will be met with the full legal force of the Wesley group.

4
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:11,080
Mr. Wesley, these are just reporters, you know, they're gossip-obsessed.

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,839
You know how the news is, it's...

6
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:13,900
Save it.

7
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,900
I can see right through all your bullshit.

8
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,059
Security.

9
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:19,899
From now on, Joanna Howard is not allowed on the premises.

10
00:00:19,899 --> 00:00:21,899
No! What? Mr. Wesley!

11
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:23,469
What?

12
00:00:23,469 --> 00:00:26,870
Any further lies about my wife and we will bury you in lawsuits.

13
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:27,870
Got it?

14
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:38,939
Minute.

15
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:41,140
Yes, ma'am, is there something else?

16
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:43,140
Yes. Contact Philip.

17
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,539
Tell him to come home. Don't mention the divorce.

18
00:00:47,539 --> 00:00:49,140
Understood, ma'am.

19
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:05,489
Let's get married.
