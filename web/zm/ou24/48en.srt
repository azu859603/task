1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
I thought we were already married.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,040
Don't you think we're missing something?

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:12,349
Bring on your finger, proper wedding ceremony.

4
00:00:12,349 --> 00:00:17,350
Yeah, I think we're missing a real relationship.

5
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:24,280
We can always date after we're married.

6
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:28,859
My wife deserves a real romantic wedding.

7
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:41,100
I won't skimp on a single detail.

8
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,100
Are you sure your mom wants to meet me?

9
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,100
Didn't she want us to get a divorce before?

10
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:49,710
She's actually really eager to meet you now.

11
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:53,509
This isn't some kind of trap, is it?

12
00:00:53,509 --> 00:01:08,760
My dear daughter-in-law.

13
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,049
It's been a while.

14
00:01:11,049 --> 00:01:15,780
It's your year, Ellie, Ellie, dear.

15
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:21,939
As well be for me what you like.
