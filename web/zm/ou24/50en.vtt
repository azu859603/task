00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:05.019
Oh, my God, that feels so good.

2
00:00:05.019 --> 00:00:06.540
It's so good.

3
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.580
You're so good at this.

4
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.859
Did you like to take classes or something?

5
00:00:10.859 --> 00:00:17.300
Watch a few YouTube videos.

6
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.339
I never really had a good relationship before.

7
00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:22.899
I don't wanna rush things.

8
00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:26.670
Then we share a bed the first night we met.

9
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.070
And now you think we're moving too fast?

10
00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.539
Should we get out the handcuffs?

11
00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:40.030
I don't know, it wasn't too bad, was it?

12
00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:51.700
Not at all.

13
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.460
Why her and not me?

14
00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.649
Baby, just forget about Philip, okay?

15
00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:05.400
You old Brian Dye was not Ellie's real father.

16
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.549
You are an idiot.

17
00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:14.629
Joanna, what about me?

18
00:01:14.629 --> 00:01:16.140
I love you.

19
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.859
You know I love you.

20
00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:21.030
I'll do anything for you.

21
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.670
Really?

22
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.629
Anything?

23
00:01:24.629 --> 00:01:32.000
Anything.

24
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.510
You really love me then?

25
00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:38.510
You'll kill Ellie.
