00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.990
Why'd you save me?

2
00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:06.990
That car was headed for me, it should have been me in that accident.

3
00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:11.779
Did you find anything?

4
00:00:11.779 --> 00:00:13.779
Who's responsible for this?

5
00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:17.780
The street cameras were damaged and the driver fled the scene.

6
00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.780
We have no solids at the moment.

7
00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:21.780
Okay, we'll keep searching.

8
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.780
This was a attempted murder, we can't let them get away with this.

9
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:25.980
Yes ma'am.

10
00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:31.539
I thought it would please be okay.

11
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.700
I promise I'll find out who did this.

12
00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.310
You said you'd never leave me, I'm not going anywhere.

13
00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:54.780
Where's my?

14
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.920
Who are you?

15
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.250
Your wife.

16
00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:04.250
My wife?

17
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.700
Who's that?

18
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.030
You've lost your memory?
