1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
You've lost your memory?

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,599
I'm kidding.

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,080
You scared me to death? I thought you really forgot me.

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,939
How are you? How are you feeling?

5
00:00:12,939 --> 00:00:16,940
I overheard you yell in for them to find who did it.

6
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:18,940
You sounded pretty intense.

7
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:21,010
You heard that?

8
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:24,739
Yeah. I think I know who did it.

9
00:00:24,739 --> 00:00:37,130
Mrs. Wesley, we found them at the airport before they boarded their plane.

10
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:39,130
Oh, thanks to you.

11
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:40,130
Please forgive Joanna.

12
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:43,130
She was drunk last night. She didn't really mean to-

13
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:44,130
Excuse me, Mr. Howard.

14
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:48,130
Since when does being drunk justify hitting someone with a car?

15
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:53,130
So, my husband is seriously injured and no one faces any consequences?

16
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:56,130
You're right, Mrs. Wesley.

17
00:00:56,130 --> 00:01:00,130
Mr. Wesley, I didn't mean to actually hit you.

18
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:01,130
You weren't trying to hit me.

19
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:04,129
You were aiming for my life, weren't you?

20
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:06,129
I've been putting up with your shit for too long.

21
00:01:06,129 --> 00:01:07,129
I'm over it.

22
00:01:07,129 --> 00:01:10,129
Have fun rotting in prison. Take them to the police.

23
00:01:10,129 --> 00:01:11,129
Yes, ma'am.

24
00:01:11,129 --> 00:01:15,129
Mrs. Wesley, please forgive us. Please, Mrs. Wesley, please.

25
00:01:15,129 --> 00:01:17,129
Please, should it mean it?

26
00:01:17,129 --> 00:01:20,609
I don't know, and we'll try to keep us apart.

27
00:01:20,609 --> 00:01:30,739
Are you looking for this?
