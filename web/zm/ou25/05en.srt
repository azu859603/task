1
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:12,509
I think this one fit better, but if you don't like a ring, you don't have to keep it.

2
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:31,739
We can change in parents a day.

3
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:33,740
Wrong number, sorry.

4
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:37,399
Okay, I have to go.

5
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:39,810
Bye.

6
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:40,810
Interesting.

7
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:48,109
So, you mean I basically paid him my rent money?

8
00:00:48,109 --> 00:00:49,109
Yeah.

9
00:00:49,109 --> 00:00:51,179
Well, coming in late, Mar.

10
00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:54,170
And I overpaid him.

11
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:56,170
Oh, I need to get that money back.

12
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:57,649
Honey.

13
00:00:57,649 --> 00:00:58,649
How much money?

14
00:01:00,509 --> 00:01:06,609
Well, hundreds.

15
00:01:06,609 --> 00:01:07,609
What?

16
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:13,760
Oh my God, it's my grocery, like, for one month.

17
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,420
Yeah.

18
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:17,420
Okay.

19
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:21,290
So, I think I need to change my job.
