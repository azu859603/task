1
00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:06.469
And you always respect her and above all,

2
00:00:06.469 --> 00:00:11.269
Mr. Lee, she deserves a fair shot.

3
00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:13.269
Why we didn't look at it?

4
00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:24.719
So, Henry Gunner,

5
00:00:24.719 --> 00:00:28.170
they come up out and you single out.

6
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.130
Fashion staff, you hate it?

7
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.130
Thank you, that doesn't give you many options.

8
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.130
So, the company offered me a position as a government for three years.

9
00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.130
If I choose, always stick around.

10
00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:48.130
Okay, Mr. Lee, I will go to the finish and we'll contact you next week.

11
00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.130
No, this afternoon, she's my assistant.

12
00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:59.810
No.

13
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:00.810
Hey, Henry.

14
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:01.810
Learn from the bottom.

15
00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:06.379
Get to each other and send all this mess to Jack.

16
00:01:06.379 --> 00:01:09.829
Everyone, meeting in 30 minutes.

17
00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:11.829
Take me coffee.

18
00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:14.569
Got it, boss.

19
00:01:14.569 --> 00:01:22.290
Go in.

20
00:01:23.379 --> 00:01:32.540
So, Mr. Designer, can you fix it?
