This is the embarring, like a table.

2
00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:24.500
Go in.

3
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:31.460
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.140
Mr. and designer, can you fix that?

5
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:49.979
Maybe you can see good prices.

6
00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:55.820
You know, sometimes too much details make it competitive.

7
00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.570
I think that some empty spaces will make it even better.

8
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:01.409
Good.

9
00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:03.329
Next time, let's start along.

10
00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.579
We think it's over.

11
00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:19.719
It's a long day.

12
00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:22.219
Oh.

13
00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:23.219
No, I'm a client.
