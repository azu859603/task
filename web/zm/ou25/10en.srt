1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,589
It was really nice to meet you forever.

2
00:00:09,589 --> 00:00:13,279
But now it's time to go home.

3
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:22,730
We've been drinking, so I think it's not necessary.

4
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:25,089
Come on, it's such a good cat.

5
00:00:25,089 --> 00:00:28,489
Do not let women go home alone.

6
00:00:28,489 --> 00:00:31,489
Yes, but I already ordered the other.

7
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:32,490
So, thanks.

8
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:33,490
Bye.

9
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:34,490
Bye.

10
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:35,490
See you.

11
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:51,299
Bye.

12
00:00:51,299 --> 00:00:56,179
Well, thanks.

13
00:00:56,179 --> 00:00:57,179
You're walking this in the logic.

14
00:00:57,179 --> 00:00:58,179
I see.

15
00:00:58,179 --> 00:01:03,320
I came to work in a hurry, so...

16
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:08,319
Do you think you're an urban elite because of wearing a knuckleback?

17
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:10,319
It's not knuckleback.

18
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:12,319
It's from second-hand market.

19
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:13,900
Interesting.

20
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:17,900
When high school I was a queen deal, but you...

21
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,920
Oh, I get it.

22
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,920
You're a new criminal company.

23
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:31,750
You're sick with this measly assistant job forever.

24
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:36,420
Further here and already seeing the workspace pooling.
