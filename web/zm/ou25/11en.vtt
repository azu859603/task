You want to make a run for it or it's been late

6
00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:45.359

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.960
Thank you. Yeah, I want to see everything. You want to see this but I know this is my favorite

8
00:00:53.759 --> 00:00:56.960
Unexpected choice. Usually you pick up flesher items

9
00:00:57.679 --> 00:00:59.039
Changing in heart

10
00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:11.200
My boss

11
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.640

13
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.060
This blue shadow is helpful

14
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.579
For my resistance equals. It's not creative. I sir

15
00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.810
Okay

16
00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.650
So my job is to remember all trends and cleanse champagne drinks. Yes

17
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:38.079
Lovely

18
00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:39.519
An explicit choice

19
00:01:39.519 --> 00:01:41.280
Usually you pick up flesher items

20
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.680
Changing in heart

21
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.140
Maybe

22
00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.140
One second

23
00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.500
Yes

24
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:55.379
Smaller gun

25
00:01:55.379 --> 00:01:56.819
What's this?

26
00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:59.140
All that they complicated it'd be a protection

27
00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.620
Honestly

28
00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.700
If we have that similar taste

29
00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.780
You should have taken care of any stress

30
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.980
You

31
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:09.580
Are you in play?

32
00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:10.780
Yeah, dear

33
00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.539
This isn't a pathetic coincidence

34
00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:14.060
Or it's just talking now

35
00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.580
Why do you follow me everywhere?

36
00:02:16.419 --> 00:02:18.340
Same stone fiancé dream

37
00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.099
And a desperate copicatress

38
00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.259
Okay, you're all live

39
00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:23.460
Right

40
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:24.580
I mean

41
00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.139
I need to stress in every color

42
00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:29.139
Of course, you can have whatever you want baby

43
00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:30.500
I know you're the best to me

44
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.020
I know you want to give me any treasure

45
00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.460
On like this

46
00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:34.500
Or a guy

47
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.699
Not only

48
00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:37.780
I thought we were friends but

49
00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.139
Calling me a poor guy

50
00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:40.099
Friends

51
00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:41.939
Charity case more like

52
00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:45.139
You'll get back to the best of yours we're made for each other

53
00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:46.419
Quali, low class

54
00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:51.900
Friends

55
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.659
Charity case more like

56
00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:56.379
You'll get back to the best of yours we're made for each other

57
00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.219
Quali, low class

58
00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.539
Not doing my fiancé

59
00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:01.900
Seriously darling

60
00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:03.949
This

61
00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:05.550
It's not a place for your kind

62
00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:07.069
Maybe cleaning

63
00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:08.030
Films and I will tell

64
00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:09.870
Those might match your budget

65
00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:14.349
Thomas

66
00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:16.110
Yes, sorry

67
00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.830
I'm sorry

68
00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.189
Mr. President

69
00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:20.110
These clothes have been taken

70
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:21.229
Of the shelves

71
00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:22.750
In accordance with your order

72
00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:24.669
Take the care of the dress

73
00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.469
And all much kindness to her

74
00:03:27.469 --> 00:03:28.270
You got it Paul

75
00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:34.259
President

76
00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.900
Him

77
00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:36.419
Please wait

78
00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:37.219
That mistake

79
00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:41.219
Is that the poor guy who's been like a senior at our wedding?

80
00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.060
He can't afford it

81
00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:44.659
Get rid of him

82
00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:47.139
Let's get out of the scum now

83
00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:50.189
Let's go

84
00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:52.430
My VIP status means nothing

85
00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:53.150
Don't take a moment

86
00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.409
Give me a hug

87
00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:55.969
Here we go

88
00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:56.449
Thank you

89
00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:00.960
I'm sorry

90
00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.199
You must live

91
00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.139
You need to live

92
00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:06.939
Just come babe

93
00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:08.060
Just come

94
00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:16.050
The material

95
00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.930
Is it called?

96
00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:17.649
I'm not

97
00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:18.370
I don't mind

98
00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:22.430
Love of fear?

99
00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:23.310
Really?

100
00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:24.589
Stop thinking

101
00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:26.189
Your little scandal

102
00:04:26.189 --> 00:04:27.069
Cussed me money

103
00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:28.990
Take the care of the dress

104
00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:31.629
And all much kindness to her

105
00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.040
Get rid

106
00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.879
Company policies for everyone

107
00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:53.120
Even you need to make a appointment

108
00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.920
Again

109
00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:54.560
Yeah

110
00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.720
But I'm your fiancé

111
00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:57.360
Okay

112
00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.279
How long do you have attached me?

113
00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:01.220
Okay

114
00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:04.899
Maybe I look at hot room

115
00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.819
Or will your place do

116
00:05:09.459 --> 00:05:10.259
It's rain

117
00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:12.100
Don't touch me ever again

118
00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:20.060
Don't touch me ever again

119
00:05:21.709 --> 00:05:22.670
Fine

120
00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:25.860
Lean hard to get

121
00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:26.660
Are we?

122
00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:28.019
Okay

123
00:05:28.019 --> 00:05:29.779
So this little thing

124
00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:31.860
Will go out

125
00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:33.139
From your life

126
00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:36.259
With her fake carrier

127
00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:41.939
Mr. President

128
00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:44.259
Was this meeting about something urgent?

129
00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:44.980
Wow

130
00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:47.540
The star of show is here

131
00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:49.540
I didn't expect that you're proud

132
00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:51.300
To get you this far

133
00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:52.259
Darling

134
00:05:52.579 --> 00:05:54.420
But enjoy it

135
00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:55.620
While it lasts

136
00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:57.620
And

137
00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:59.680
Recognize this

138
00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:01.680
Summa here

139
00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.519
From your little

140
00:06:03.519 --> 00:06:05.040
letters and days

141
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:13.410
You're ready to pack your bags

142
00:06:14.579 --> 00:06:16.420
Because we're a slatter

143
00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:17.459
Coming right up

144
00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:19.649
Along with your

145
00:06:20.209 --> 00:06:21.329
designer

146
00:06:21.329 --> 00:06:22.560
Darkpools

147
00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:23.680
Mansion

148
00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:24.800
Good dream

149
00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.000
Take your dirt or haul

150
00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:32.350
Good dream

151
00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:33.949
Take your dirt or haul

152
00:06:33.949 --> 00:06:37.779
And when you

153
00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:39.860
Well on streets

154
00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:41.939
They can afford money

155
00:06:41.939 --> 00:06:42.819
Remember

156
00:06:44.079 --> 00:06:45.360
I

157
00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.560
Maybe

158
00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:47.680
Give you

159
00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:48.480
A gun

160
00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:56.129
I think of Oscar was the story

161
00:06:56.129 --> 00:06:57.810
Since it will dove

162
00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:58.610
After all to do

163
00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.839
Maybe I'll be prepared for that fight

164
00:07:01.839 --> 00:07:29.250
You're seeing most of it

165
00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:31.250
But I'll get a fork means you turn

166
00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:34.660
Right

167
00:07:38.139 --> 00:07:39.339
You need to take it

168
00:07:39.339 --> 00:07:40.459
Don't get your coat

169
00:07:40.459 --> 00:08:10.850
Oh don't worry

170
00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:28.990
You need to mind about

171
00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:30.509
What's they catering

172
00:08:30.509 --> 00:08:31.069
Jealousy

173
00:08:31.069 --> 00:08:33.149
Make people always say crazy things

174
00:08:33.149 --> 00:08:34.980
Don't worry

175
00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:38.580
Those insults can't hurt my big ambitions

176
00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:39.899
And

177
00:08:39.899 --> 00:08:41.980
If my designs weren't good

178
00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:43.419
Should I need to steal?

179
00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:44.940
No, you shouldn't

180
00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:52.879
Oh Mr. President

181
00:08:52.879 --> 00:08:54.559
You parked down here

182
00:08:54.559 --> 00:08:55.519
Late night

183
00:08:55.519 --> 00:08:56.639
With the brains

184
00:08:56.639 --> 00:08:57.600
I guess

185
00:09:02.129 --> 00:09:03.169
How about you ladies?

186
00:09:04.129 --> 00:09:05.649
Subway's a bad bit

187
00:09:05.649 --> 00:09:09.149
Is it possible to be nice?

188
00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:25.409
Leave the way, Shafar

189
00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:45.980
Katarina and I wait for your call all night

190
00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:47.100
Goddamn it Morgan

191
00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:49.940
Ten billion because of you

192
00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:51.379
I don't need your electors

193
00:09:51.379 --> 00:09:52.899
I have no interest

194
00:09:52.899 --> 00:09:54.659
In the stuff what you try to teach me

195
00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:56.659
My life is my choice

196
00:09:58.769 --> 00:10:48.340
My dreams

197
00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:48.980
I worked

198
00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:50.740
My big big have no worries

199
00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:51.700
Nivers again

200
00:10:52.179 --> 00:10:54.100
The airlines get it to me too

201
00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:55.220
Sometimes

202
00:10:56.159 --> 00:10:57.120
Oh

203
00:10:59.179 --> 00:11:00.620
That's my apartment

204
00:11:01.019 --> 00:11:01.740
Thanks

205
00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:34.740
Leah

206
00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:35.700
Are you all right?

207
00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:36.179
Yeah

208
00:11:36.179 --> 00:11:36.659
Yeah

209
00:11:36.659 --> 00:11:38.340
I'm with my boyfriend

210
00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:39.460
He's closer

211
00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:41.139
I'm gonna cash it up later

212
00:11:41.139 --> 00:11:42.100
Okay

213
00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:43.299
That's great

214
00:11:43.299 --> 00:11:45.539
If you have some time you can come to me

215
00:11:45.539 --> 00:11:46.179
I'm good

216
00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:48.820
Don't care about me

217
00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:51.059
I can't take care about myself

218
00:11:51.899 --> 00:11:52.860
Sleep well

219
00:11:52.940 --> 00:12:01.659
We'll ignite this

220
00:12:02.899 --> 00:12:05.620
souvenir from your little

221
00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:07.460
like your days

222
00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:07.860
Friends

223
00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:10.259
Charity kids more like

224
00:12:10.259 --> 00:12:11.460
You don't have back to the best

225
00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:12.980
The others were made for each other

226
00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:14.659
How do you know?

227
00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:56.960
I call you

228
00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:58.559
Why aren't you applying to me?

229
00:12:58.559 --> 00:13:00.909
I thought it's so buttery

230
00:13:00.909 --> 00:13:01.950
I think you're hungry

231
00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:04.269
Let's go to the restaurant

232
00:13:04.269 --> 00:13:05.230
You choose

233
00:13:05.549 --> 00:13:06.669
I have a better idea

234
00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:22.909
Behold

235
00:13:22.909 --> 00:13:23.789
Sarah

236
00:13:26.289 --> 00:13:27.330
Budget grab

237
00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:28.769
Behold cheese

238
00:13:28.769 --> 00:13:29.649
Dipping from

239
00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:31.490
Liver

240
00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:33.169
Personally, as it may be

241
00:13:33.169 --> 00:13:33.649
But try

242
00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:35.840
I'll try it

243
00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:36.480
Thanks good

244
00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:37.679
Yes

245
00:13:41.539 --> 00:13:42.820
For now, I understand

246
00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:45.139
My headset's wild

247
00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:47.379
Projects, ideas

248
00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:48.419
This barn

249
00:13:50.019 --> 00:13:51.059
It's a sugar rush

250
00:13:51.779 --> 00:13:52.659
Okay

251
00:13:52.659 --> 00:13:53.940
We do know coffee

252
00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:56.419
And grace make my brain go around

253
00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:01.809
Oh, I know you wonder that I will ruin your

254
00:14:01.809 --> 00:14:03.409
Yes, image

255
00:14:03.409 --> 00:14:04.529
It's not about image

256
00:14:05.629 --> 00:14:07.230
It's about not fashion

257
00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:08.750
Anything in life

258
00:14:09.309 --> 00:14:10.029
Okay

259
00:14:10.029 --> 00:14:10.909
So next time

260
00:14:11.549 --> 00:14:13.309
I will buy a car smoothie

261
00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:16.590
Don't like my supermodel talent

262
00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:19.629
I'm not saying that I don't need a raise

263
00:14:19.629 --> 00:14:20.269
But

264
00:14:20.269 --> 00:14:21.149
It's not about food

265
00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:23.470
Mostly a concentration

266
00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:24.029
of the team

267
00:14:24.669 --> 00:14:25.870
Creating a safe place

268
00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:27.470
Without stress

269
00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:32.620
Make a set

270
00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:33.980
Don't play a superhero, okay?

271
00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:35.019
I'm not

272
00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:37.259
I just have apartment

273
00:14:37.259 --> 00:14:38.220
Close here

274
00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:38.779
And for you

275
00:14:39.899 --> 00:14:40.779
It will be rent free

276
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:42.720
Rent free

277
00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:47.519
Rent free

278
00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:49.279
That's can't be true

279
00:14:49.279 --> 00:14:51.600
It's not just CEO generosity

280
00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:52.320
What's the price?

281
00:14:52.879 --> 00:14:54.320
Let's say image control

282
00:14:55.539 --> 00:14:56.500
Of course

283
00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:57.460
Exchange

284
00:14:57.460 --> 00:14:58.580
Effect-fiance

285
00:14:58.580 --> 00:14:59.539
Will run in two bits

286
00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:03.519
So more fake stuff

287
00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.679
Wasn't it just one night act?

288
00:15:12.059 --> 00:15:12.539
Of course

289
00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:23.250
Generacy

290
00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:25.970
But won't an old scandalous place

291
00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:26.450
Trust me

292
00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:28.850
It's one less battle alone

293
00:15:29.649 --> 00:15:31.970
And assume you to continue our partners

294
00:15:33.059 --> 00:15:34.100
To your revenge plan

295
00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:37.309
Okay

296
00:15:38.559 --> 00:15:39.440
Be all my partner

297
00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:40.320
Deal

298
00:15:57.759 --> 00:15:59.120
But take your heels off

299
00:16:02.299 --> 00:16:05.419
So it's a first longer inspection

300
00:16:05.899 --> 00:16:06.139
Yes

301
00:16:07.139 --> 00:16:08.100
Mm

302
00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:09.700
Should I take care about this

303
00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:10.980
Expensive self act

304
00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:13.620
Which cost more than mine

305
00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:14.740
I did not everything

306
00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:17.139
To this place like your home

307
00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:19.620
But I need to take shower first

308
00:16:59.090 --> 00:16:59.889
What are you doing?

309
00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:01.090
It

310
00:17:02.419 --> 00:17:03.700
Were naked

311
00:17:04.259 --> 00:17:06.099
I just put it in a close

312
00:17:06.099 --> 00:17:07.859
And I call you

313
00:17:07.859 --> 00:17:08.819
But you didn't answer

314
00:17:09.859 --> 00:17:11.700
So I just carried out to you

315
00:17:12.099 --> 00:17:12.579
Okay

316
00:17:23.549 --> 00:17:26.029
You know it's really hot here

317
00:17:26.029 --> 00:17:29.549
I think I should go and take a shower

318
00:18:13.089 --> 00:18:16.369
Go slash temporary landlord

319
00:18:16.369 --> 00:18:19.329
I'm not judging your bathroom ideas

320
00:18:19.329 --> 00:18:20.769
But it told us

321
00:18:21.809 --> 00:18:22.529
Really

322
00:18:23.019 --> 00:18:25.980
It covers less than my coffee cup

323
00:18:26.539 --> 00:18:27.980
It's a efficient apartment

324
00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:29.339
Intimate to be towards now

325
00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:30.700
Few options

326
00:18:31.869 --> 00:18:32.349
Across

327
00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:34.450
We can't take it

328
00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:40.849
Am I dancing here from CAO

329
00:18:40.849 --> 00:18:41.809
Secret lights

330
00:18:42.849 --> 00:18:43.569
Ex-Morgans

331
00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:48.269
Can I borrow your hair dry?

332
00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:00.509
Is it in hot?

333
00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:01.950
Not bad

334
00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:06.210
It's not

335
00:19:07.279 --> 00:19:07.759
But

336
00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:12.299
So is there any other room?

337
00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:14.700
Maybe a guest room

338
00:19:15.259 --> 00:19:16.619
For now I'm just a little drunk

339
00:19:17.259 --> 00:19:18.700
Self-waste a little bit cracking

340
00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:20.670
Okay

341
00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:33.599
What are we doing?

342
00:19:33.599 --> 00:19:35.230
Just checking you

343
00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:36.430
If I was okay

344
00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:39.440
If you're comfortable

345
00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:40.559
I want to say goodnight

346
00:20:03.839 --> 00:20:06.960
Can I get off at the intersection before the company?

347
00:20:07.759 --> 00:20:08.160
Of course

348
00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:12.990
If you want to be company on time

349
00:20:14.049 --> 00:20:16.210
The sneakers will help you run faster

350
00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:24.210
Okay

351
00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:25.329
I accept it

352
00:20:25.329 --> 00:20:26.849
But I will return your money

353
00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:41.460
Tomorrow is the weekend

354
00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:44.339
I want to celebrate with a really big meal

355
00:20:44.339 --> 00:20:45.859
After this hard week's work

356
00:20:47.059 --> 00:20:50.259
Think about the fences place you can

357
00:20:50.259 --> 00:20:53.140
Only the best for our team superstar, right?

358
00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:57.569
Okay, I need to ask the president if their schedule is great

359
00:20:57.569 --> 00:20:59.650
And then I will go

360
00:21:01.009 --> 00:21:05.859
I have a quick question

361
00:21:06.609 --> 00:21:08.609
Is the schedule for tomorrow, right?

362
00:21:08.609 --> 00:21:09.410
Clear schedule

363
00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:11.809
Your work is done

364
00:21:11.809 --> 00:21:12.130
Thanks

365
00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:16.670
Busman approach

366
00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:18.109
Time to celebrate

367
00:21:18.109 --> 00:21:19.150
I'm so hungry

368
00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:20.349
Let's go

369
00:21:20.910 --> 00:21:30.269
And what are you doing?

370
00:21:31.309 --> 00:21:32.750
I don't know, I really

371
00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:34.029
Yeah, that is amazing

372
00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:35.230
It was so good

373
00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:37.150
Yeah, it was so small

374
00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:38.190
Yeah

375
00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:40.029
I don't know what happened in this chair

376
00:21:40.029 --> 00:21:41.549
Kitchen, but it was amazing

377
00:21:41.549 --> 00:21:43.069
But I'm so tired

378
00:21:43.069 --> 00:21:44.750
Guys, I'm gonna order over

379
00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:45.549
See ya

380
00:21:45.549 --> 00:21:46.349
Okay, bye

381
00:21:46.349 --> 00:21:46.910
See you

382
00:21:46.910 --> 00:21:48.349
And how you're going?

383
00:21:48.349 --> 00:21:49.630
I'm going with bus

384
00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:50.750
Bus

385
00:21:51.309 --> 00:21:54.109
That doesn't really scream

386
00:21:54.109 --> 00:21:55.309
In Michelin approach

387
00:21:55.309 --> 00:21:55.789
Oh, really?

388
00:21:55.789 --> 00:21:56.750
After party, yeah

389
00:21:57.390 --> 00:21:58.670
That is the job

390
00:21:58.670 --> 00:22:18.619
I have a car right there

391
00:22:18.619 --> 00:22:22.539
Wait for me!

392
00:22:23.339 --> 00:22:31.970
So, Mr. President, thank you again

393
00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:35.890
For this most efficient, right chair operation

394
00:22:35.890 --> 00:22:37.250
Truly beyond and above

395
00:22:38.779 --> 00:22:43.019
I wonder if the community has returned to its ordinary state

396
00:22:43.019 --> 00:22:44.460
You've heard the news

397
00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:45.500
Back whatever you left

398
00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:48.059
And not make it more complicated

399
00:22:48.059 --> 00:22:49.099
I'm good at moving

400
00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:50.619
I go with you

401
00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:56.849
Oh god

402
00:22:57.730 --> 00:23:01.710
That

403
00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:03.470
That exceeds some

404
00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:05.390
release regulations, I believe

405
00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:09.140
Certainly changing your residence

406
00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:10.900
is vital for safety's sake

407
00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:13.200
Thanks guys

408
00:23:14.339 --> 00:23:15.220
Nice pet dog

409
00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:17.539
But put someone hand me a mob

410
00:23:17.539 --> 00:23:19.059
before I break down his style

411
00:23:19.619 --> 00:23:21.940
If you're a tyrant, just take a rest

412
00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:23.539
You can help you with this mess

413
00:23:23.539 --> 00:23:24.579
In a language

414
00:23:24.579 --> 00:23:25.700
Come on

415
00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:28.019
Let's go to a hotel together

416
00:23:28.019 --> 00:23:29.299
And spend the night

417
00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:35.700
Okay guys, it's Bobo, you chill

418
00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:37.700
I just want to be alone for a while, okay?

419
00:23:41.299 --> 00:23:42.819
No, it's so dangerous

420
00:24:06.319 --> 00:24:07.920
Guys, it's really late

421
00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:10.819
To go sleep and take a rest

422
00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:13.460
So, see you tomorrow

423
00:24:14.099 --> 00:24:16.420
Take a rest, take an app, see you tomorrow

424
00:24:17.299 --> 00:24:19.890
I... give me a second

425
00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:26.910
Give me a phone

426
00:24:26.910 --> 00:24:28.109
This is my number

427
00:24:28.109 --> 00:24:30.109
If ever for a problem, just call

428
00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:57.740
I will give it a ride

429
00:24:57.740 --> 00:25:26.369
To go now, I will say I'm

430
00:25:26.369 --> 00:25:27.970
Be nervous

431
00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:29.410
I was gonna be fine

432
00:25:29.410 --> 00:25:30.849
Darling, trust me

433
00:25:31.809 --> 00:25:46.509
I got my son

434
00:25:46.509 --> 00:25:46.990
Go back

435
00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:54.960
You don't know how much I miss

436
00:25:56.019 --> 00:25:57.380
Hello, I'm Maria

437
00:25:57.940 --> 00:25:58.660
Nice to meet you

438
00:26:01.390 --> 00:26:03.309
So you are the famous plagiarist

439
00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:08.180
Desperate of short way

440
00:26:08.819 --> 00:26:09.779
My eyes burned

441
00:26:09.779 --> 00:26:11.779
He's searching the accuracy in how home

442
00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:14.210
Take this woman out

443
00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:15.089
I don't want to see her

444
00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:22.140
Take this woman out

445
00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:23.099
I don't want to see her

446
00:26:23.579 --> 00:26:25.420
If she's staying, I stay

447
00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:28.059
If you want to please her from the dinner

448
00:26:28.859 --> 00:26:30.220
You get the opportunity

449
00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:30.859
Otherwise

450
00:26:31.779 --> 00:26:32.420
Are you dead?

451
00:26:33.009 --> 00:26:34.210
Such disrespect

452
00:26:34.849 --> 00:26:36.369
After you, that is my fiancé

453
00:26:37.759 --> 00:26:40.559
I will not, if anyone, root her

454
00:26:42.339 --> 00:26:42.740
Leo

455
00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:46.670
Let's go

456
00:26:46.670 --> 00:27:01.789
It's good

457
00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:07.700
You said that you need a new designer draft for the fashion show

458
00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:11.940
So, I have already started driving them

459
00:27:12.579 --> 00:27:15.539
Did they receive a new satisfactory designs?

460
00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:18.799
Jains, not seriously speaking

461
00:27:19.819 --> 00:27:21.900
I have a very disciplined answer to him

462
00:27:22.849 --> 00:27:24.369
I hope you surprise him

463
00:27:31.549 --> 00:27:33.069
I hope you surprise him

464
00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:40.059
When I was working part time as a chef

465
00:27:40.539 --> 00:27:42.779
I usually make some dishes

466
00:27:42.779 --> 00:27:45.579
From the days, extras, ingredients

467
00:27:45.579 --> 00:27:47.180
And then share it with everyone

468
00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:52.960
Working part time is not something strange for most of people

469
00:27:53.039 --> 00:27:57.599
Of course, the situation is less in the design major

470
00:27:57.599 --> 00:27:59.920
But there's also people like me

471
00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:02.240
Who needs to earn money to pay their tuition

472
00:28:04.339 --> 00:28:05.299
But take it easy

473
00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:08.509
Cheers

474
00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:10.579
Cheers, but for what?

475
00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:17.460
For me, working so hard to be in the design industry

476
00:28:18.099 --> 00:28:19.059
We should celebrate

477
00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:37.650
What do you want from me?

478
00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:39.250
I have a lot of work

479
00:28:39.250 --> 00:28:39.730
Work?

480
00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:41.700
Are you kidding me?
