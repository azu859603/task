1
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,500
Oh, yeah.

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,500
What do you want from me?

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,500
I have a lot of work.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,539
Are you kidding me?

5
00:00:15,539 --> 00:00:17,539
Oh, cute shoes.

6
00:00:17,539 --> 00:00:19,629
Trash collector and strike.

7
00:00:19,629 --> 00:00:24,719
If you want a big company on time,

8
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:26,719
the sneakers will help you run faster.

9
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:29,780
Keep talking there.

10
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:33,780
My lawyers turn like every word of standard.

11
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,780
If you want to challenge me,

12
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:42,539
but how swan is an important sponsor of these events.

13
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:48,539
And I can guarantee you that your design will never appear

14
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:50,539
in this fashion show.

15
00:00:50,539 --> 00:00:54,539
Because, you know, the big is different between you

16
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:58,539
and me that I have money.

17
00:00:58,539 --> 00:01:04,540
And my money can turn your original work into a heroism

18
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:08,540
and make people who original believe you

19
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,640
commit perjury.

20
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,640
And even if you have money to get a lawyer,

21
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,739
what can you do to me?
