00:00:04.209 --> 00:00:06.209
So why are you here?

2
00:00:06.209 --> 00:00:11.009
You know, I've been dealing with Gatorade's Little Trix for way too long.

3
00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:12.609
So you already knew?

4
00:00:12.609 --> 00:00:18.809
I've never heard about your play reason, but she always uses MG Design's resources

5
00:00:18.809 --> 00:00:22.609
to contribute to Swan that's simply unreasonable.

6
00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:25.609
So the company, that was my turn to you.

7
00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:31.410
Let's say this sign, the bone was his happiness taken away for control.

8
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.810
I also found him a partner because she was afraid that the girl would come back.

9
00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:39.009
Like that?

10
00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:42.609
Of course Morgan had a crush on him in high school.

11
00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:46.409
Maybe his princess isn't some corporate hareress.

12
00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:53.130
Maybe the girl whose name won't be mentioned anywhere is his happiness.

13
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.130
Wait, do you care about him?
