00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.169
Wait, do you care about him?

2
00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:07.610
No, no, I'm actually curious.

3
00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:11.679
She's been living in his heart.

4
00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:15.960
So, just another scheme for the power place.

5
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.559
The crash you mentioned, part of the sacrifice, them.

6
00:00:19.559 --> 00:00:22.000
No, he's banned.

7
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.160
He wants to be with a girl for the rest of his life.

8
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.219
I am the heir.

9
00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.450
If you're empty, when the storm settles,

10
00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.460
they'll meet artists, not schemers.

11
00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.560
Maybe you belong there, not here in the mess.
