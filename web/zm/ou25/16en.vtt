00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:09.279
Yes?

2
00:00:09.279 --> 00:00:13.289
More time.

3
00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:15.699
I'll be back soon.

4
00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:30.920
Don't let's give me everything.

5
00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.299
This is a despair between me and Smoz.

6
00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:37.299
This painting is Van Gogh's Irish,

7
00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:39.299
which I copied when I was in high school.

8
00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:41.299
I love my paintings,

9
00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:47.299
but I think that my classmate made the best copy.

10
00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:50.429
Even if nobody knows his name,

11
00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:53.429
he was like an example of excellent.

12
00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:57.429
I always can recognize his painting.

13
00:00:57.429 --> 00:01:00.429
I studied it for a while.

14
00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:02.429
I think the owner of this painting

15
00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:04.430
wants to say a great job,

16
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:05.430
haven't you?

17
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.040
And by the way,

18
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.040
with his audience,

19
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.040
we can go to the legal departments

20
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.040
to do evidence,

21
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.040
to win this case.

22
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.900
I wanted to ask you for a long time ago,

23
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.900
why are you willing to help me like this?

24
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.420
And just a minute ago, I knew the answer.
