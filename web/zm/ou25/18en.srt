1
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:15,550
Do you know why we need disinfected sanitations matters?

2
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:21,030
One wouldn't want unpleasant associations to infect a bloodline after all.

3
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:25,030
Don't bother trying to embarrass me. I'm confident enough.

4
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:30,030
To make a long story short, I called you here because I want you to disappear from Morgan.

5
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,700
After I got to know you'll become less and less like before.

6
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:45,590
I know who you are.

7
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:47,590
Come on, son. Left to go.

8
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:51,590
I think someone else is painting what to say to the great child.

9
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:56,460
She deserves a very shot. Why wouldn't you look at it?

10
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:01,090
I don't know if anyone wrote her.

11
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:05,340
He wasn't meant to linger at childish crushes.

12
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:08,340
True potential doesn't come wrapped in a cheap sentiment.

13
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:12,340
Morgan can always make the decision that it is best for him.

14
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:16,340
Your cleaning couldn't erase his talent. He was a true artist.

15
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:21,469
Enough. Accept it or erase you and your precious member.

16
00:01:21,469 --> 00:01:22,469
Oh, I don't want it.
