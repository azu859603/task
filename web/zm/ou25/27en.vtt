1
00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:03.259
I don't have a guts.

2
00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:06.259
You're not gonna do your right boy hands, aren't ya?

3
00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:12.550
You're gonna get done.

4
00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:13.550
He wants you to do it.

5
00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:17.760
Oh, no!

6
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.760
Look, how do the bullets?

7
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:20.760
Yes, the bullets!

8
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.789
Right now, I officially sterilized.

9
00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:34.820
Bitch, pretend to fight duty.

10
00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.950
Is it hard?

11
00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.140
No, it's fine.

12
00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.259
I just don't want to feel spoiled to you.

13
00:00:47.259 --> 00:00:54.259
Okay, but next time you can take risks like this and, you know, I used to it.

14
00:00:54.259 --> 00:00:59.100
Next time, if your lies go straight to me,

15
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.119
I'll get such rules no matter what cost.

16
00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:17.090
Then the use to it.

17
00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.980
Next time, if your lies go straight to me,

18
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:27.290
I'll get such rules no matter what cost.

19
00:01:27.290 --> 00:02:18.659
Then the use to it.

20
00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:23.539
A comfy in detention last night?

21
00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:25.539
New plans ready.

22
00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:29.780
Don't mess this up, okay?

23
00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.490
Remember, feet and hand, it must be clean.

24
00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.900
Mm-hmm.

25
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:55.759
Or, or maybe you want to get in locked up.

26
00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:57.759
I don't know guys, how you could do that.

27
00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:59.759
Well, someone talked to me.

28
00:02:59.759 --> 00:03:03.139
It's so ruined.

29
00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:06.139
All the jewelry in the studio was taken out and a lot of it was broken.

30
00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:08.139
There was nothing to see.

31
00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:11.139
Treshed, designed, smashed prototypes.

32
00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:12.139
We are dead in the water.

33
00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:14.139
Don't tell me what we can do.

34
00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:15.139
Just do.

35
00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:22.900
We could do the best show, guys.

36
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:23.900
Classics.

37
00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:24.900
Classics?

38
00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.900
You think that we will make headlines?

39
00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:28.900
We need bold.

40
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:29.900
We need new.

41
00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:37.569
Maybe certain people have the interest in life who wouldn't have this conversation.

42
00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:41.229
How are you saying this is my fault?

43
00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:42.229
Wait.

44
00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:45.419
There's another way.

45
00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:47.509
I draw it for the fashion show.

46
00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:53.770
I hope you can take a look.

47
00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:58.770
I want my cat for smashing games and shredded fabrics.

48
00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:08.710
Time is one thing we don't have, sweetheart.

49
00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:09.710
Pretty sketches.

50
00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:15.860
I want my cat for smashing games and shredded fabrics.

51
00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:21.829
Time is one thing we don't have, sweetheart.

52
00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:24.829
Yeah, okay, but think about rebuilding.

53
00:04:24.829 --> 00:04:25.829
Yeah?

54
00:04:25.829 --> 00:04:30.470
We can take food left and make something new.

55
00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.470
Like, okay, our classic style, but fresher.

56
00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:40.660
I think it can keep our company alive and to give our customers something new.

57
00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:52.870
Too slow, too risky.

58
00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:57.660
Okay, give me a week.

59
00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:58.660
Yeah.

60
00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:05.000
I leave the team, and after all, everyone will talk about it.

61
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.160
Do you promise you will finish it, we'll be in a week?

62
00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.379
I will try.

63
00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:13.850
Don't let me down.

64
00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:16.810
She will make it.

65
00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:44.110
No, Bert.

66
00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.110
I don't have time.

67
00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:47.110
Why are you here?

68
00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:50.110
I'm playing my spelling table.

69
00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:51.110
And you?

70
00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:53.110
Jack asked me to help you.

71
00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:54.110
Jack.

72
00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:55.110
Yeah.

73
00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.269
You better play.

74
00:05:57.269 --> 00:06:00.560
The name of the man you're talking about is Jason.

75
00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.560
Okay, you got me.

76
00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.939
The thing is, I just miss you.

77
00:06:05.939 --> 00:06:08.939
So maybe we should go for a ride?

78
00:06:08.939 --> 00:06:12.129
I can't.

79
00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:17.129
But if you're here and you have time, you can make me a coffee.

80
00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:19.129
Sure.

81
00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:51.259
Thanks.

82
00:06:51.259 --> 00:06:54.220
My beautiful Cinderella.

83
00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:58.829
I fell in love with you at first sight.

84
00:06:58.829 --> 00:07:02.279
I can't even explain why.

85
00:07:02.279 --> 00:07:12.920
But now I see who your heart belongs to.

86
00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:17.589
But now I see who your heart belongs to.

87
00:07:17.589 --> 00:07:23.379
I think it's time for me to wait.

88
00:07:23.379 --> 00:08:13.050
Good morning.

89
00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:21.420
I assume you have a damn sleep.

90
00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:25.500
Yes, that's true.

91
00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:28.500
And this looks like you're really good.

92
00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:30.850
Good.

93
00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:33.850
But still, show is half hour away.

94
00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:34.850
Oh my god.

95
00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:36.850
Thanks for the breakfast.

96
00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:37.850
Don't go.

97
00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:39.850
You can't go by taxi or subway.

98
00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:40.850
Take my car.

99
00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:41.850
Oh my god.

100
00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:42.850
It wasn't safe in my career.

101
00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:43.850
Oh.

102
00:08:43.850 --> 00:09:01.539
Boss, are you sure about it?

103
00:09:01.539 --> 00:09:04.539
Maybe we should get a professional makeup artist.

104
00:09:04.539 --> 00:09:05.539
I do not know.

105
00:09:05.539 --> 00:09:07.539
There's anything I can mention, darling.

106
00:09:07.539 --> 00:09:08.539
Trust me.

107
00:09:08.539 --> 00:09:09.639
Okay.

108
00:09:09.639 --> 00:09:13.639
But if it messes up my debut, it's on you.

109
00:09:13.639 --> 00:09:14.990
Done.

110
00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:17.750
Oh.

111
00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:18.750
It's impressive.

112
00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:20.750
That's better what I can do.

113
00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:25.419
So, our teaching can transfer any form.

114
00:09:25.419 --> 00:09:26.419
Just this time.

115
00:09:26.419 --> 00:09:27.419
Don't step on your hand.

116
00:09:27.419 --> 00:09:29.419
Do your way to start them.

117
00:09:29.419 --> 00:09:37.370
Leah.

118
00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:42.450
Didn't you ask what you really like?

119
00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:45.240
It's you.

120
00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:48.240
When you first time see you, I recognize your work.

121
00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:57.779
I think that some empty space will make it even better.

122
00:09:57.779 --> 00:09:59.779
You work harder.

123
00:09:59.779 --> 00:10:04.500
And by you, I'll cook usually.

124
00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:08.830
I like all about you.

125
00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:15.559
And if you would be my fiancée, I'll give you all my love.

126
00:10:15.559 --> 00:10:18.940
Will you be my fiancée?

127
00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:21.190
Will you be my wife?

128
00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:30.899
Will you be my wife?

129
00:10:30.899 --> 00:10:41.440
Well, again.

130
00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:44.580
Not now.

131
00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:51.659
Okay, wait.

132
00:10:51.659 --> 00:11:04.019
You see?

133
00:11:04.019 --> 00:11:08.529
During some of the right place, right now.

134
00:11:08.529 --> 00:11:17.269
So, you're saying that you're choosing me for a loan?

135
00:11:17.269 --> 00:11:21.269
That you're losing that opportunity to propose.

136
00:11:21.269 --> 00:11:42.620
Like I said, there is some battle you shouldn't fight for a loan.

137
00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:45.620
That you're losing that opportunity to propose.

138
00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:57.919
Like I said, there is some battle you shouldn't fight for a loan.

139
00:11:57.919 --> 00:12:04.350
Well, again, I've worked hard to train you over the years.

140
00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:06.350
And this is how you repay me?

141
00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:08.350
I will meet your life first.

142
00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:12.350
I have no interest in this doubt what you tried to teach me.

143
00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:14.350
My life is my choice.

144
00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:20.529
Like this is not a place for your kind.

145
00:12:20.529 --> 00:12:22.529
Maybe cleaning clothes and the toe?

146
00:12:22.529 --> 00:12:26.059
Those might match your budget.

147
00:12:26.059 --> 00:12:44.899
I can guarantee that your design will never appear in this fashion show.

148
00:12:44.899 --> 00:12:48.919
I have a good time with you.

149
00:12:48.919 --> 00:12:50.919
I have a good time with you.

150
00:12:50.919 --> 00:13:15.289
I have a good time with you.

151
00:13:15.289 --> 00:13:17.789
Cheers.

152
00:13:17.789 --> 00:13:19.889
Cheers, but for what?

153
00:13:19.889 --> 00:13:25.889
For me, working so hard to be in that design industry.

154
00:13:25.889 --> 00:13:30.789
She's my fiancé.

155
00:13:30.789 --> 00:13:34.240
I will not, if anyone wrote her.

156
00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:38.990
Well, yeah.

157
00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:40.990
I didn't get asked what girl I like.

158
00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:42.179
It's you.

159
00:13:42.179 --> 00:13:44.409
I like all about you.

160
00:13:44.409 --> 00:13:51.370
I'll give you all my love.

161
00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:52.370
So is you.

162
00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:53.370
You're too much.

163
00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:54.370
Okay, see you.

164
00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:57.200
Next time, if you realize.

165
00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:59.200
It goes straight to me.

166
00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:02.200
I will get the truth no matter what cost.

167
00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:06.899
Leah, would you marry me?
