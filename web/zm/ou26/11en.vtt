00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:21.109
Come down here sweetheart. Come on. Is she yours?

2
00:00:24.379 --> 00:00:25.859
Yes father

3
00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.289
Deal with your own jewels

4
00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:49.939
Dad, I trust that she's not gonna talk

5
00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:52.070
Marcus

6
00:00:52.070 --> 00:01:13.109
The only people who don't talk are dead people trust no one outside the family. She's my fiance

7
00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:36.489
Marcus move aside. Listen to me dad. You're the one that taught me that a man must protect his woman at all costs

8
00:01:36.489 --> 00:01:38.489
That's what I'm doing right now

9
00:01:38.609 --> 00:02:12.520
Visions a beauty. I'm sorry about my baby. I didn't mean to scare you Betty. What is your name?

10
00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.930
Eddie

11
00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.719
Betty what a great name

12
00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:31.580
So when is the big day soon?

13
00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:38.430
Really soon mr. Wade here

14
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.819
Throw that dress on here. You're gonna go meet my whole family right now, okay

15
00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:47.780
I'm not marrying you

16
00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:57.550
What makes you think that I want to marry a girl like you your hotel housekeeper your stripper

17
00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:07.620
Then why don't you let me go? I will you think my dad's gonna let you go though after you just saw him fucking kill somebody

18
00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:37.740
Huh? I don't think so put the dress on and let's go for your mother's sake Marcus

19
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.610
Is this your fiance?

20
00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:56.879
Yes, it is

21
00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:00.879
I thought our family was for me in alliance with the Gambino family

22
00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.909
By you marrying Kelly

23
00:04:04.469 --> 00:04:07.490
Can anyone tell me who the hell this?

24
00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:14.520
Betty is which family does she belong to?

25
00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:21.839
Uncle John

26
00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:24.220
Who I choose as my wife is my right?

27
00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:32.079
You ain't a kid. No more Marcus grow up. I'm not the only one who's against this nobody's gonna change my mind

28
00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:39.120
Nobody you see about that the Wade family deserves a stronger alliance

29
00:04:40.079 --> 00:04:45.120
Marcus for the family's benefit. You should reconsider your son's marriage to

30
00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.589
Betty

31
00:04:49.589 --> 00:04:50.709
otherwise

32
00:04:50.709 --> 00:04:54.529
There could be a division

33
00:04:54.529 --> 00:05:08.050
Within the family. I'm a joke. Are you threatening me? It's just a suggestion

34
00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.319
Marcus

35
00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:18.560
Betty seems like an ordinary girl. I still believe the Kelly of their Gambino family

36
00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.329
Your wiser choice

37
00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:22.410
Marcus

38
00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:26.480
Tell everyone. What does this girl do?

39
00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:37.709
Well uncle John if you don't mind me asking what exactly were you doing when you met a catheter in here for a truck driver, right?

40
00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:43.670
How dare you speak like that?

41
00:05:44.269 --> 00:05:56.800
Betty is my woman. Nobody's gonna stop us

42
00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:07.610
Okay, I'm gonna marry her and nobody can stop us. I disagree

43
00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:21.560
Kelly what the hell are you doing here?

44
00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:23.560
Remember the jewelry lost

45
00:06:23.839 --> 00:06:27.160
The jewelry that the long-to-us the Gambino family

46
00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:34.740
The Gambino family is willing to buy gone. Say bye. Go under one

47
00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:48.449
Condition estimated Kelly. I think these are two separate matters. Have a restock conflating the two, right?

48
00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:51.879
What do you think?

49
00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:56.480
The Gambino family is an answer to you. I'm afraid

50
00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:14.629
I need some time to make it more sterile. My study. Stay here, okay?

51
00:07:15.069 --> 00:07:23.290
Nobody loves you more than I do Marcus. You're a menace Kelly. There's nothing more

52
00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:40.579
That I hate the menaces. You cross a line. And who the hell are you?

53
00:07:41.019 --> 00:07:44.250
How dare you seal Marcus from me? I

54
00:07:45.519 --> 00:07:47.079
steal him from

55
00:07:47.079 --> 00:07:53.399
There has been a huge misunderstanding. I'm the one who's supposed to be his bride name your price disappear from his world forever

56
00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:57.850
Honestly, I don't want to marry him. I'm being forced to

57
00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:06.399
Right, I almost believe you. It's a hundred thousand enough. 200,000. Seriously. It's not about the money

58
00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:10.959
Don't trust my patience. You're getting way over your head

59
00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:17.480
friendly advice. I have a thousand ways to deal with money-loving

60
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Super-fless bitches like you

61
00:08:20.279 --> 00:08:33.950
You know, I never plan to get into your little family drama

62
00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:40.000
You know that I'm here. I won't leave Marcus's side unless he wants me to

63
00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:43.080
And we'll see who the bitches

64
00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:50.100
We shall see pretty soon. Marcus

65
00:08:50.700 --> 00:09:04.379
Has no choice but to make me Marcus

66
00:09:05.929 --> 00:09:07.929
losing a batch of jewelry is

67
00:09:08.169 --> 00:09:26.070
Too much for the family. I choose Betty. There's nothing to apply. I wanted a son

68
00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:31.029
Your decision not only puts this family in jeopardy

69
00:09:31.759 --> 00:09:37.509
It also gets you expelled from this family. You know the consequences. Yeah, I do

70
00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:46.610
I made up my mind. I hope you don't live to regret it. There is no regret in my book

71
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.250
Hold on

72
00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:55.639
by the family rules

73
00:09:55.799 --> 00:10:25.970
You're not allowed to take any assets with you very well. I don't like being threatened

74
00:10:26.769 --> 00:10:31.250
And I certainly have no obligation to pay for the family's mistakes. That's that's for sure

75
00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:43.279
I'll get the hell out of here now. Let's go. Where are we going?

76
00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:47.159
To your house

77
00:10:47.159 --> 00:10:48.120
No

78
00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:53.720
Why? I just severed ties with my family. I'm penniless and homeless and sure as hell owe me one. So let's go

79
00:10:55.830 --> 00:11:00.740
You just severed ties with your family for me. You just met me like two days ago. Why don't you understand?

80
00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:05.460
It's too late for all that now. You just witnessed my father fucking kill somebody if you leave me now

81
00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:07.460
They're gonna kill you too. You get it?

82
00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:22.470
So let's go

83
00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:24.470
Thought you said we were going to my house

84
00:11:24.799 --> 00:11:30.070
I'm gonna make a quick stop first

85
00:11:30.309 --> 00:11:32.950
What exactly are you looking for?

86
00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:35.269
My family's lost jewelry trying to reclaim what's mine

87
00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:40.899
Well, it's truly mine

88
00:11:40.899 --> 00:11:44.870
In there

89
00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:45.750
No

90
00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:47.480
Of course not

91
00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.480
But I think that there's a mole in the family

92
00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:54.120
Or maybe even the Gambino family's stealing from within. I don't know either way. I'm gonna get to the bottom of this

93
00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:58.870
Okay

94
00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:02.470
By yourself

95
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:06.610
No

96
00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:08.230
I got you, right

97
00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:09.919
My assistant

98
00:12:09.919 --> 00:12:15.639
No, I already have two jobs. I'm trying to pay for my mother's medical expenses

99
00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:18.360
I don't have time for your bullshit

100
00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:23.159
You know, I forgot to mention

101
00:12:23.159 --> 00:12:25.159
I never paid Michael for that hundred grand

102
00:12:25.809 --> 00:12:28.129
I could easily file a complaints thing that you assaulted me

103
00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:31.090
Based on that stupid contract that you signed

104
00:12:31.759 --> 00:12:33.759
That hundred grand would be your responsibility

105
00:12:33.759 --> 00:12:36.559
So let me know what you think about that. Please do not do that

106
00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:40.210
Okay

107
00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:42.080
Then let's make a deal

108
00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:44.080
I cover your mother's medical expenses

109
00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:46.080
You continue to be my assistant

110
00:12:46.639 --> 00:12:48.399
And my fiance

111
00:12:55.169 --> 00:12:57.889
But I thought you said you just got kicked out of your family and you were broke

112
00:13:03.779 --> 00:13:05.139
Congratulations

113
00:13:05.139 --> 00:13:07.700
Consider your mother's medical expenses covered

114
00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:29.190
This is only $50,000

115
00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:33.110
What that's not enough. It's my getaway money for situations like these

116
00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:35.840
No, it's

117
00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:37.840
It's enough. It's just

118
00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:40.179
Just what?

119
00:13:40.179 --> 00:13:42.259
Well, if I take it, what are you gonna do?

120
00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:54.639
Just take it

121
00:13:54.639 --> 00:13:57.279
It's for your survival. I can't take it

122
00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:01.840
Betty, come on. Listen to me

123
00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:05.519
I meant what I said. I want you to take the money and take care of your mom

124
00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:09.960
Unless you stick to the plane

125
00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:13.279
Your mind now and I need you to cooperate

126
00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:25.679
Remember, it's just a deal

127
00:14:25.679 --> 00:14:27.730
It's between me and you

128
00:14:27.730 --> 00:15:04.210
That's it

129
00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:05.570
So this is your place, huh?

130
00:15:06.549 --> 00:15:08.629
You've never seen such a small house before

131
00:15:12.529 --> 00:15:17.860
I'm gonna go take a shower

132
00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:19.620
You wanna join me?

133
00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:21.379
I'll go start cooking

134
00:15:21.379 --> 00:16:20.789
Why aren't you wearing any clothes?

135
00:16:20.789 --> 00:16:40.500
I don't know. I'll help you feast your eyes on my body a little bit more. Looks good

136
00:16:41.879 --> 00:16:47.639
Thank you

137
00:16:47.639 --> 00:16:49.000
That is really good

138
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:49.559
Yeah?

139
00:16:49.559 --> 00:16:50.850
Really good

140
00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:52.370
We taught you how to cook

141
00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:52.929
My mom

142
00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:56.309
She is the most important person in my life

143
00:16:56.309 --> 00:16:58.789
She must have been an excellent cook and tell you that

144
00:16:58.789 --> 00:16:59.590
She was

145
00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:00.950
She taught me a lot of cooking skills

146
00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:06.369
She always said cooking is an expression of love

147
00:17:06.369 --> 00:17:10.930
Yeah, she was a really hard worker

148
00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:13.009
She really wanted me to go to college so she

149
00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:16.440
Picked up three jobs

150
00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:17.480
Felt me through it

151
00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:24.259
And she, uh, earned herself out three years ago

152
00:17:28.309 --> 00:17:29.670
What about your father?

153
00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:32.319
He left us when I was five

154
00:17:32.319 --> 00:18:48.150
I'm sorry to hear that

155
00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:49.589
It's just a deal

156
00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:51.829
Nothing more

157
00:18:51.829 --> 00:19:17.410
We'll see who it is

158
00:19:17.410 --> 00:19:26.849
I can't see who it is

159
00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:30.420
Hey, Betty, you home?

160
00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:31.220
Don't

161
00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:42.359
It's my colleague

162
00:19:42.359 --> 00:19:43.240
I want him to leave now

163
00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:44.759
Get him the fuck out of here

164
00:19:44.759 --> 00:19:46.680
I'm gonna do what they just got back to me

165
00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:51.680
Who's there?

166
00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:53.490
It's me, Anthony

167
00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:54.450
I've already gone to bed

168
00:19:54.450 --> 00:19:56.210
Look, I'm sorry to bother you this late

169
00:19:56.210 --> 00:19:57.730
I actually came by earlier

170
00:19:57.730 --> 00:19:58.609
But you weren't home

171
00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:00.609
Yeah, is it alright if I come in?

172
00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:12.500
Hey, Betty

173
00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:13.859
Hey, Anthony

174
00:20:15.029 --> 00:20:16.390
You, uh, got a guest over

175
00:20:17.029 --> 00:20:17.670
A boyfriend?

176
00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:19.190
No, no, I

177
00:20:21.599 --> 00:20:22.480
It's my brother

178
00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:23.039
No

179
00:20:23.039 --> 00:20:24.960
He's here to visit my mom

180
00:20:25.839 --> 00:20:26.640
Cool

181
00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:28.640
Hey, maybe I could comment and say hi

182
00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:31.279
No, he doesn't like talking to strangers

183
00:20:31.839 --> 00:20:33.920
Listen, I didn't see you at work today

184
00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:34.640
Is everything okay?

185
00:20:35.829 --> 00:20:37.589
Yeah, do you need me to do any

186
00:20:37.589 --> 00:20:38.470
You should have paid more

187
00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:41.619
Just, I had to visit my mom

188
00:20:41.619 --> 00:20:42.099
So

189
00:20:42.099 --> 00:20:43.700
Oh, yeah, um

190
00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:47.059
If it's about money, um, I think that this can help

191
00:20:47.059 --> 00:20:53.119
Well, where did you get that?

192
00:20:53.119 --> 00:20:53.680
Don't worry

193
00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:54.880
This money is clean and safe

194
00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:56.390
It's for you and your mom

195
00:20:57.109 --> 00:20:58.130
Come on

196
00:20:58.130 --> 00:21:00.210
Anthony, no, I can't take that

197
00:21:00.210 --> 00:21:01.089
I can't take it

198
00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:03.170
Okay, it's a lot

199
00:21:04.529 --> 00:21:07.720
It's late, I mean, I'm tired

200
00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:08.759
Are you tired?

201
00:21:08.759 --> 00:21:09.960
We should go to bed

202
00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:11.700
I love to

203
00:21:11.779 --> 00:21:13.140
I know that's a bit bold

204
00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:15.920
Um, I was afraid that if

205
00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:20.710
I didn't confess to you that, uh, I'd lose you forever

206
00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:22.470
Love you, buddy

207
00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:23.750
I really love you

208
00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:24.630
Can you give me a chance?

209
00:21:27.009 --> 00:21:27.890
I appreciate you

210
00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:31.720
Really, you're four years younger than me

211
00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:32.920
I mean, you're like my little brother

212
00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:34.680
I know that I'm younger, but I know what love is

213
00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:35.079
Love?

214
00:21:36.099 --> 00:21:38.630
Anthony, you don't even know

215
00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:40.900
You can't

216
00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:42.019
No, but I can

217
00:21:42.019 --> 00:21:43.140
I can't, I can't

218
00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:44.819
I can't do anything that a man can do

219
00:21:44.819 --> 00:21:45.940
I could probably do it better

220
00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:47.700
Anthony, I know you're a great man

221
00:21:48.339 --> 00:21:50.339
But we're just not right for each other

222
00:21:50.339 --> 00:21:50.819
How do you know?

223
00:21:50.819 --> 00:21:51.859
How do you know it's not right

224
00:21:51.859 --> 00:21:53.380
If you don't give it a try

225
00:21:53.380 --> 00:22:07.890
Look, I'm so sorry

226
00:22:08.529 --> 00:22:09.410
You should go

227
00:22:09.410 --> 00:22:10.210
Forgive me, Betty

228
00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:10.690
Betty

229
00:22:18.359 --> 00:22:19.319
What the hell was that, Betty?

230
00:22:20.369 --> 00:22:21.650
Anthony, he's my coworker

231
00:22:24.359 --> 00:22:25.480
Don't lie to me

232
00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:27.670
I saw him kiss you

233
00:22:27.670 --> 00:22:29.109
Don't bullshit me, okay?

234
00:22:29.109 --> 00:22:30.069
He's young

235
00:22:30.069 --> 00:22:31.509
I don't want other men

236
00:22:31.509 --> 00:22:32.390
Touching my woman

237
00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:35.079
Not anyone's belonging, Marcus

238
00:22:37.599 --> 00:22:38.960
You belong to me, only to me

239
00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:40.319
And I don't want you to forget that

240
00:22:41.519 --> 00:22:43.920
I don't ever want another man to touch you

241
00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:45.519
Ever again

242
00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:48.470
And if he tries, I'll fucking kill him

243
00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:49.509
Do you understand?

244
00:22:49.509 --> 00:22:53.990
Do you understand?

245
00:23:08.819 --> 00:23:11.539
So you like it when men just kiss you

246
00:23:11.539 --> 00:23:14.660
Oh, this thing

247
00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:58.900
Hey, Betty's not coming into work today

248
00:23:58.900 --> 00:23:59.220
Okay

249
00:23:59.779 --> 00:24:02.960
Marcus, you have no right to interfere with my job

250
00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:03.920
Actually, I do

251
00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:05.359
You're my assistant now

252
00:24:05.359 --> 00:24:06.240
We have to read on it

253
00:24:06.799 --> 00:24:08.160
On my days off

254
00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:10.869
Not your slave, Marcus

255
00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:17.829
Late

256
00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:18.950
No show

257
00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:20.549
Late

258
00:24:20.549 --> 00:24:21.509
Three days in a row

259
00:24:21.509 --> 00:24:23.190
I just can't put up with it anymore, Betty

260
00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:23.829
You're fired

261
00:24:23.829 --> 00:24:25.509
Please don't do this, Rex

262
00:24:25.509 --> 00:24:26.630
I'm sorry

263
00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:28.069
I really need this job

264
00:24:28.069 --> 00:24:29.029
Blaming on your boyfriend

265
00:24:29.029 --> 00:24:30.789
Or whoever it is you're sleeping with

266
00:24:30.789 --> 00:24:32.869
I mean, who does he think he is talking to me like that

267
00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:34.849
Bastard

268
00:24:34.849 --> 00:24:35.250
God

269
00:24:37.539 --> 00:24:38.660
What are you still doing here?

270
00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:39.779
You made me lose my battle

271
00:24:39.779 --> 00:24:40.339
Get out

272
00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.039
But maybe look at you again

273
00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:51.640
Hey, Betty

274
00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:52.359
Glad to have you back

275
00:24:57.599 --> 00:24:58.160
Ready?

276
00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:00.710
I just kept fired

277
00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:01.029
What?

278
00:25:01.029 --> 00:25:01.990
Who fired you?

279
00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:03.029
Was it Rex that idiot?

280
00:25:03.029 --> 00:25:04.230
I swear to God

281
00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:04.789
You're forced out

282
00:25:05.890 --> 00:25:07.410
I think you're gonna get in trouble

283
00:25:07.410 --> 00:25:08.450
No, how dare he though

284
00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:10.049
You've been working so hard

285
00:25:10.049 --> 00:25:11.970
It will be the hotel's loss to have you fired

286
00:25:12.609 --> 00:25:13.650
Thank you, Anthony

287
00:25:13.650 --> 00:25:14.289
You know what?

288
00:25:14.289 --> 00:25:15.329
I'm gonna talk to him

289
00:25:15.329 --> 00:25:16.769
I'm sure he can convince his mind

290
00:25:16.769 --> 00:25:17.490
No, Anthony

291
00:25:17.490 --> 00:25:18.609
He'll change his mind

292
00:25:18.609 --> 00:25:20.759
Don't get yourself in trouble for me

293
00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:31.680
Please forgive my rude and reckless words

294
00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:34.319
I got a call from the boss just now

295
00:25:34.319 --> 00:25:35.839
Congratulations

296
00:25:35.839 --> 00:25:37.680
You've been assigned the manager position

297
00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:39.599
of the customer service department

298
00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:41.599
It's a big step up

299
00:25:41.599 --> 00:25:44.079
in all the waters under the bridge now

300
00:25:54.529 --> 00:25:55.009
Hey, Betty

301
00:25:55.650 --> 00:25:56.690
Congrats on the promotion

302
00:25:57.410 --> 00:25:58.130
Very impressive

303
00:25:59.119 --> 00:25:59.519
Thank you

304
00:26:01.039 --> 00:26:03.359
I actually have some pretty cool news as well

305
00:26:03.359 --> 00:26:04.640
I just got transferred here

306
00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:06.880
So from now on you're my new boss

307
00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:11.200
Anthony, Rex said that the boss promoted me

308
00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:13.119
But I don't even know who the boss is

309
00:26:13.119 --> 00:26:15.039
I mean there has to have been a mistake or something

310
00:26:15.039 --> 00:26:15.839
Don't overthink it

311
00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:17.920
I mean, never in here has seen your hard work

312
00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:19.599
You know, you deserve this

313
00:26:23.809 --> 00:26:26.609
Listen, you're uh, you're not still mad about

314
00:26:26.609 --> 00:26:27.650
Yesterday

315
00:26:27.650 --> 00:26:30.950
Are you the kiss?

316
00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:34.069
You know I'm really sorry

317
00:26:34.069 --> 00:26:35.109
Just don't let it happen again

318
00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:40.440
You're my only friend in the hotel after all

319
00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:42.680
Betty

320
00:26:43.670 --> 00:26:46.470
There's a guest in room 1401

321
00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:48.549
who seems to be in some trouble

322
00:26:48.549 --> 00:26:50.549
She specifically requested you to handle it

323
00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:53.910
Uh, okay, I'll be right there

324
00:26:53.910 --> 00:26:54.950
I'll come with you

325
00:26:54.950 --> 00:27:22.150
I didn't expect to meet you so soon

326
00:27:25.039 --> 00:27:26.480
Can I help you with something, Kelly?

327
00:27:28.130 --> 00:27:29.410
I just checked in

328
00:27:29.410 --> 00:27:31.970
And there's already wine stains on my bed sheet

329
00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:34.130
Is that something that you're disgusting?

330
00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:34.930
Can I see them?

331
00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:44.480
How's that $1,000 dress?

332
00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:46.079
You spilled that on yourself

333
00:27:46.079 --> 00:27:47.680
Is that your hotel treats?

334
00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:48.480
Yes

335
00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:49.759
I'll file a complaint

336
00:27:49.759 --> 00:27:52.000
I can testify, you deliberately bumped into her

337
00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:53.200
So what?

338
00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:55.920
I'm part of the Gambino family

339
00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:58.309
Who do you think will believe the words of you

340
00:27:58.309 --> 00:27:59.190
low lives?

341
00:27:59.190 --> 00:27:59.990
Come on Betty

342
00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:00.869
She's not worth her time

343
00:28:01.890 --> 00:28:02.930
A housekeeper

344
00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:05.940
Is a housekeeper

345
00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:09.759
I want you to remember your place

346
00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:12.079
Stay away from Marcus

347
00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:14.240
You don't deserve him

348
00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:14.720
Marcus?

349
00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:17.160
Marcus Wade?

350
00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:18.119
Pick the mafia guy?

351
00:28:19.319 --> 00:28:20.119
Betty
