1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
You little Tramp!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Two days and one day.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Guess what will happen when Mark explains out?

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
There is nothing between Anthony and I.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Oh, what a pity boy.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Look how she just turned her back on you just like that.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,640
Do you still want to speak up for her?

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:27,899
I'm going to get the both of you fired.

9
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:30,899
No weak Kelly!

10
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:37,049
Anthony, you have no idea what you just started.

11
00:00:37,049 --> 00:00:39,049
I promised to protect you.

12
00:00:39,049 --> 00:00:42,049
God, I'm so sorry for getting involved in this.

13
00:00:42,049 --> 00:00:44,049
Okay, just listen, okay.

14
00:00:44,049 --> 00:00:48,429
As long as you don't abandon me again, nobody can hurt us.

15
00:00:48,429 --> 00:00:52,310
It's okay.

16
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:55,310
Alright, let's get you cleaned up. Get those wine stands out.
