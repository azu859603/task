00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:07.549
Toy, you think that I disobeyed my father, chose you over Kelly and got kicked out of

2
00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:11.140
my family for a toy, have you lost your mind?

3
00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.859
He was the one who said, whatever happens between us is just part of the deal.

4
00:00:14.859 --> 00:00:18.420
Yes, technically you're right, but you never asked how long the deal was for.

5
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:25.600
How long is the deal for?

6
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.600
A thousand years.

7
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:31.149
I want you to be mine for the next thousand years.

8
00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:35.500
And when this mess is finally over, I'm going to return home and I'm going to ask

9
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.500
you to marry me.

10
00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.429
Or we can just consider it a part of our agreement now.

11
00:00:41.429 --> 00:00:46.520
Mary, you... but Marcus, I...

12
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.520
No buts.

13
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.649
No buts.

14
00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:51.759
By the way, I just saved your life once again.

15
00:00:51.759 --> 00:00:54.679
I think that you owe me a little bit more than you think.

16
00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:57.140
I'm getting a little hot.

17
00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.140
Can you do me a favor?

18
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:08.180
I'll be back, okay.
