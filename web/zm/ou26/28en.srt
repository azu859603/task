1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,990
James didn't tell you where he got the necklace today.

2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:06,429
Marcus in the entire weed family is after that right now.

3
00:00:06,429 --> 00:00:09,230
If you keep it on, you're wearing a target on your back.

4
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:14,449
It literally looks like a target.

5
00:00:14,449 --> 00:00:22,059
I'm not part of this, but I'm afraid she's right.

6
00:00:22,059 --> 00:00:27,699
Thanks, buddy.

7
00:00:27,699 --> 00:00:41,640
I'm assuming you don't want Marcus to think you had anything to do with this.

8
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,640
Fine. Let me make a couple calls.

9
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:53,560
Lisa, do you think you could show me who James is?

10
00:00:53,560 --> 00:01:19,140
It looks like the devil's coming to us.

11
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:24,950
Hey, buddy. They didn't have a wine, so I got one.

12
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:36,239
Betty? status report on Betty.

13
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:38,269
Sir, we've located Betty.

14
00:01:38,269 --> 00:01:39,269
Where is she?

15
00:01:39,269 --> 00:01:40,269
His trip up and down now.

16
00:01:40,269 --> 00:01:41,269
Okay, is Marcus there?

17
00:01:41,269 --> 00:01:43,269
No, he's still nowhere to be found.

18
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:44,269
Well, then find him.

19
00:01:44,269 --> 00:01:46,269
Send more men out and find him.

20
00:01:46,269 --> 00:01:48,269
We have to find him before Betty does.

21
00:01:48,269 --> 00:01:53,269
I'm sorry, sir, but your father has forbidden the families involved in any gang-related matters.

22
00:01:53,269 --> 00:01:56,269
I don't give a shit. Okay, can we just have to find Betty?

23
00:01:56,269 --> 00:02:04,849
I promised I swore to her that I would protect her.

24
00:02:04,849 --> 00:02:05,849
Just get my gun ready.

25
00:02:05,849 --> 00:02:47,110
Jules, what are you talking about?

26
00:02:47,110 --> 00:03:07,030
Are the Jules.

27
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,030
Okay.

28
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:10,030
Those Jules, my father has him.

29
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,030
My dad, he's working with little John.

30
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:14,030
He paid us a fortune for those Jules.

31
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,030
What's his intention?

32
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:19,180
They don't want to take over the Wade family.

33
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,180
That's everything I know are.

34
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,180
They swear, please.

35
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,180
You should have thought about that before you hurt Betty.

36
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:25,590
You can't kill me.

37
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:27,590
You don't even worry between her and me.

38
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:33,460
Where is she?

39
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,259
Where's Betty?

40
00:03:35,259 --> 00:03:37,729
Oh, you're again, huh?

41
00:03:37,729 --> 00:03:40,949
How the fuck did you get in here? Are you even old enough?

42
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:45,090
Alright, so you're looking for Betty.

43
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:47,090
Let me tell you something about her.

44
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:49,090
You got no fucking clue who she is.

45
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:50,090
No fucking clue.

46
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:51,090
Shut up.

47
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:53,090
Shut up, Marcus.

48
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:55,659
One move from me and you'll never see her again.

49
00:03:55,659 --> 00:03:56,659
What are you going to do?

50
00:03:56,659 --> 00:03:57,659
Blow my fucking brains out, Anthony.

51
00:03:57,659 --> 00:03:59,659
What's Betty going to think about that?

52
00:03:59,659 --> 00:04:05,530
Where did you get the gun?

53
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:06,530
Your parents?

54
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:07,909
Put it down.

55
00:04:07,909 --> 00:04:10,360
I was trying to protect you.

56
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,360
You're not even 21.

57
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,680
You can't even be in here.

58
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,680
Go home.

59
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:19,939
I didn't ask you to protect me.

60
00:04:19,939 --> 00:04:23,259
Come on, stay out of here.

61
00:04:23,259 --> 00:04:26,079
Betty.

62
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:34,290
Betty, Marcus is dangerous.

63
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:35,290
Okay, he can't protect you.

64
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:36,290
I can save you.

65
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:38,699
Please, Betty.

66
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:40,149
No.

67
00:04:40,149 --> 00:04:42,410
I'm going with Marcus.

68
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:45,139
No, it's never going to hurt you.

69
00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:46,139
Yeah.

70
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:47,139
I'm going to have to stop over by that body.

71
00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:51,180
He'll never be happy.

72
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,569
I swear.

73
00:04:52,569 --> 00:05:00,990
It's okay.

74
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:03,410
The Gambino family and old John.

75
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:05,500
They betrayed my father.

76
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,500
I think that he's in a lot of danger.

77
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,500
I'm going to go.

78
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,500
I need you to stay here.

79
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,500
Wait in backstage.

80
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,500
Don't go anywhere.

81
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,500
Okay, Betty?

82
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,500
No.

83
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,500
I'm going with you.

84
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:19,060
It's too dangerous.

85
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:46,939
It's too dangerous, Marcus.

86
00:05:46,939 --> 00:05:47,939
Mr. Gambino.

87
00:05:47,939 --> 00:05:58,569
Marcus.

88
00:05:58,569 --> 00:06:02,129
Marcus.

89
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:04,860
I think you should understand it.

90
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,250
You're not welcome here anymore.

91
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,500
I can say the same thing to you, John.

92
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,300
So am Mr. Gambino.

93
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,300
Since your son's here, you might as well tell us.

94
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,230
Where are the jewels?

95
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:20,649
Fred, there's a misunderstanding.

96
00:06:20,649 --> 00:06:24,810
The Gambino family is and always will be an ally to the Wade family.

97
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:28,980
Is that so?

98
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:33,939
Is that why you had your son James here team up with John?

99
00:06:33,939 --> 00:06:36,610
Is it commit treason?

100
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:38,120
Shut up!

101
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:54,199
What are the missing jewels?

102
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:55,199
Exactly.

103
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,199
James gave it to Betty's friend as a present.

104
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:02,019
And here's another piece.

105
00:07:02,019 --> 00:07:07,319
We got it off a man that James hired.

106
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:25,930
What else James stole me, Mr. Gambino, is that you know where the rest of the jewels are.

107
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:29,569
It's a horrible misunderstanding.

108
00:07:29,569 --> 00:07:31,569
You see, I'm a decent man.

109
00:07:31,569 --> 00:07:36,660
And I would never, never have any hidden agendas to betray my friends and allies.

110
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:40,810
This is unacceptable.

111
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:47,800
All I can say is, it's a shame to have someone like James in my family.

112
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:54,240
I'm sorry, Mr. Wade, and I'll do my best to make sure that he learns his lesson.

113
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,769
How about this, Mr. Gambino?

114
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:05,680
We'll settle things down within the family, with Uncle John.

115
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:14,009
As for the jewels, the Wade family will take them as compensation for their losses.

116
00:08:14,009 --> 00:08:18,350
They'll take an insurance buyout.

117
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:20,509
It's a win-win for everybody.

118
00:08:20,509 --> 00:08:33,419
What do you say?

119
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:57,179
Of course.

120
00:08:57,179 --> 00:08:58,340
Understood.

121
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:02,220
Okay.

122
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,220
It's done.

123
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:06,500
Old John's been taken care of.

124
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,980
Thank God.

125
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:08,980
It's all over.

126
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:18,250
Betty, thanks to you, I was able to attract down the jewels.

127
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,279
You're stuck by my side.

128
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:40,220
The whole time through all these life threatening events are amazing.

129
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,220
Will you marry me?

130
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:45,809
Will you marry me?

131
00:09:45,809 --> 00:09:51,000
Yes.

132
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Yes, Marcus, I'll marry you.

133
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:13,580
Everything looks great, Ms. Wade.

134
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:17,850
The baby's in good health.

135
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:18,850
Hey, Doc.

136
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:21,000
I'll walk you out.

137
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:39,679
So, I guess your condition returned back to normal, sir?

138
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:42,539
Would you mind telling me?

139
00:10:42,539 --> 00:10:43,929
How'd you find your cure?

140
00:10:43,929 --> 00:10:46,929
It could be helpful for my research in a related field.

141
00:10:46,929 --> 00:10:52,950
I don't know if it's applicable to your research, but I guess it only works with Betty.

142
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:53,950
Interesting.

143
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:57,750
Do you plan to continue this treatment then?

144
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,230
No.

145
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:01,100
Everything's great.

146
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:06,039
I did it for my wife, Amy.
