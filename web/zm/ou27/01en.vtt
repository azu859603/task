00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
This isn't just bad accounting. It's fraud.

2
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.160
Check out my latest video on the Garrison Group,

3
00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.160
falsifying reports from more details.

4
00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:16.820
Um, excuse me.

5
00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:26.179
Take down the videos and issue a retraction right now,

6
00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:28.179
or we'll bury you.

7
00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:32.179
Take down the videos. What matters to me is the truth.

8
00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:36.000
Listen, what?

9
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:52.700
Told you, Kim, that Garrison Group is untouchable.

10
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.079
I don't care.

11
00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:57.079
People follow me for the truth. It's exactly where I'm giving them.

12
00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:59.079
Well, good luck. We're done.

13
00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:01.079
We lucked your account and froze your payments.

14
00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.079
Your contract is terminated.

15
00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:12.560
You can't vlog for a flight.

16
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.019
It says, I'm stuck. I don't think I'm going to do it, okay?

17
00:01:18.019 --> 00:01:23.280
You just go without me and we will celebrate once you're back, okay?

18
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:50.689
There's been a car accident, and your parents didn't make it.

19
00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:53.819
Your sister, she's in a coma.

20
00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:57.819
But we need you to sign off on these payments.

21
00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:02.260
How did I get here? I cannot pay for this.

22
00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:12.340
Someone has covered the car, so we're ready for surgery.

23
00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:28.460
I'd like to say thanks. Meet me tomorrow.
