1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:13,380
Who are you?

2
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,699
Why did you pay for my sister's medical bills?

3
00:00:16,699 --> 00:00:19,219
They mean Garrison.

4
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:22,660
One of the heirs of a job for you.

5
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,679
Why me?

6
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:29,000
You know I've been tearing apart your family's scandals.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Know that?

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Exactly.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
We both want Victor Garrison on.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,380
If you become as a system, continue to pay your sister's medical bills.

11
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,009
Great.

12
00:00:41,009 --> 00:00:42,009
What do you want me to do?

13
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:44,299
Three things.

14
00:00:44,299 --> 00:00:45,329
Black stockings.

15
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:46,329
White shirt.

16
00:00:46,329 --> 00:00:48,329
Come let Victor become you.

17
00:00:48,329 --> 00:01:27,250
If you need these issues, I do his office.

18
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:32,180
You're going to be there to remember that Victor played.

19
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:48,129
The great England's are now begging for scraps as an assistant.
