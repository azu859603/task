1
00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.169
You're hurt.

2
00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:05.419
Who am I?

3
00:00:05.419 --> 00:00:08.419
But Mr. Garrison, she's the one who exposed the financial report.

4
00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:11.419
Listen, not only do you disrespect the butchering competent.

5
00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:13.419
You completely bought surprises that can't expose us on it.

6
00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:15.419
Now you're pulling this crap.

7
00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:16.870
You're demoted.

8
00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:17.870
Well, now let's go.

9
00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:37.700
You're too pretty for that latest car.

10
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:43.609
And you are ever qualified for this job.

11
00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:49.240
My sister's in the hospital and I need the job to cover her bills.

12
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.780
I am deeply sorry for what I said about the Garrison country.

13
00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.780
I hope you can forgive me.

14
00:00:58.009 --> 00:00:59.009
You're hard.

15
00:00:59.009 --> 00:01:11.950
You're enjoying the beat?
