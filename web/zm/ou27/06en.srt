1
00:00:10,029 --> 00:00:14,560
I have another job for you.

2
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:20,370
You'll be needing this?

3
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:21,370
Laurent!

4
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:24,550
Major shareholder.

5
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:26,550
My father listens to him,

6
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:31,829
and Victor needs to gain his trust to solidify his status to see you.

7
00:00:31,829 --> 00:00:33,829
He's having one of his private parties tonight.

8
00:00:33,829 --> 00:00:36,829
All of the Garrison family big wigs will be there.

9
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:42,700
You'll be going with Victor.

10
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:43,700
Your job?

11
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,859
Get close to Laurent.

12
00:00:45,859 --> 00:00:48,859
Find out all the big projects that Victor hasn't picked up on yet,

13
00:00:48,859 --> 00:00:51,539
and in return,

14
00:00:51,539 --> 00:01:04,480
I'll get you. You're two million back.

15
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,480
Hi, Victor.

16
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,859
I need you as my plus one tonight.

17
00:01:08,859 --> 00:01:10,859
Laurent is hosting. I'll text you the details.

18
00:01:10,859 --> 00:01:12,859
Be ready in an hour.

19
00:01:12,859 --> 00:01:16,500
Yeah, sure thing. I'll see you there.

20
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,519
Just, uh, watch yourself.

21
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:25,579
Laurent has a reputation. He's not the most respectful guy.
