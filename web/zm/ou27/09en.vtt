00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.259
I know what you're doing.

2
00:00:02.259 --> 00:00:04.259
Yeah, right. There it was.

3
00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:05.259
Half a pilot.

4
00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:07.259
And the yacht is still running.

5
00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:08.259
I'm like...

6
00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:10.419
I don't know what to tell you.

7
00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:17.339
Dad finally should get the prize out.

8
00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:19.339
Let's get your account, Mr. Laurent. It's one sale.

9
00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:21.339
You just got some great finds down right here.

10
00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:35.060
My collection.

11
00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.060
Some of these battles are centuries old.

12
00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.060
You won't find anything like it in the world.

13
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:40.600
It's incredible.

14
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.179
These are priceless.

15
00:00:42.179 --> 00:00:44.810
I'm so sorry.

16
00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.810
It's a bit chilly in here.

17
00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:47.810
Well, let me know what we want.

18
00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:48.810
That's okay. Thank you.

19
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:49.810
Thank you.

20
00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:54.869
Are you all right, girl?

21
00:00:54.869 --> 00:01:01.329
I'm really feeling very well. I think I have to leave.

22
00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:02.329
Of course.

23
00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:04.329
Let's get you out of here.
