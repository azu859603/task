00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.560
Something is off. I don't get drunk this fast.

2
00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.559
Let's get you to my sleep.

3
00:00:05.559 --> 00:00:06.559
I've been drugged.

4
00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:09.560
Are they asking us? You feel much more?

5
00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.560
I have to stay sharp. Laurent is bad news.

6
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.559
Odd yourself. Laurent has a reputation. He's not the most respectful guy.

7
00:00:16.559 --> 00:00:18.559
It's definitely Damien behind us.

8
00:00:18.559 --> 00:00:20.559
Are you all right, darling?

9
00:00:20.559 --> 00:00:33.770
I need to go confront him and get some of these things.

10
00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.789
Kim?

11
00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:36.789
Yeah!

12
00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:38.789
Get down. Get down. Get down, okay?

13
00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:39.789
Just relax.

14
00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:41.789
Okay, what happened in that wine song?

15
00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:42.789
I'm going.

16
00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:44.789
Okay, give me those things.

17
00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.750
Damien!

18
00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:48.750
Here we go.

19
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.750
All right, nice and easy now.

20
00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.750
Wait, wait, wait!
