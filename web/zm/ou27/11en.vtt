00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
Do you like this?

2
00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Here we go.

3
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Here we go.

4
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Here we go.

5
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.000
What is wrong here?

6
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Are you drunk?

7
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.589
You.

8
00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:16.589
I don't believe what do you know that.

9
00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:17.589
Am I?

10
00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:18.589
Do you?

11
00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:21.620
Because I'll tell you what.

12
00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:22.620
You've drunk me.

13
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:23.899
What?

14
00:00:23.899 --> 00:00:24.899
I think it.

15
00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:29.489
Yes.

16
00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:30.839
No.

17
00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:31.839
Why would I do that?

18
00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:35.350
You wanted Laurent to drug me.

19
00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.479
So then you can use me as an average.

20
00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:40.280
Okay.

21
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.280
Okay.

22
00:00:41.280 --> 00:01:18.569
What are you?

23
00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:19.730
Do what?

24
00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:20.730
You drugged me.

25
00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:21.730
You jerk.

26
00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:22.920
What's your excuse?

27
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:23.920
So why not go after Victor?

28
00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:24.920
Why just me?

29
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.140
Oh.

30
00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.140
I would prefer Victor a hundred times over you.

31
00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.140
He's not the issue here.

32
00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.140
So what?

33
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.140
I think I'm the caller.

34
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.140
Do you think I'm the back guy?

35
00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.140
Of course you are.

36
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.140
Who else could appear?

37
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.140
I mean you are the one who dragged me into this mess.

38
00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.140
All because you're better and you want to get back at your own brother.

39
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.140
That's just the type of guy you are Damien.

40
00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.269
So what are you going to do?

41
00:01:47.269 --> 00:01:48.269
You going to quit?

42
00:01:48.269 --> 00:01:49.430
I don't know.

43
00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.430
I have made it half way through and I'm going to see this until I earn back everything I lost.

44
00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.430
So you better keep your end of the deal.

45
00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:04.799
Got it?

46
00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.180
See if you think something is more dangerous than me.

47
00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:13.020
Okay.

48
00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.020
I'll take these to the legal department.

49
00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.020
They detail all the current games and great projects.

50
00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.080
All current projects.

51
00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.139
This is exactly what I wanted.

52
00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:24.979
Yeah.

53
00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:25.979
Is something wrong?

54
00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:26.979
No, no.

55
00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:27.979
Not at all.

56
00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:28.979
I'll take care of it immediately.

57
00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:30.979
I thought last night's job was a bust.

58
00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:34.979
I need to send Damien the info before this goes to legal.

59
00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:37.979
And get back my account and my two million.

60
00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:38.979
Larry?

61
00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:41.979
I mentioned that you left him last night.

62
00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:42.979
What's up with that?

63
00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:50.740
Um, I, um, was it feeling lost so I have to leave early?

64
00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.740
Oh, why don't you sleep with the Garrison Villa?

65
00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.469
It'd be easier if it weren't.

66
00:02:56.469 --> 00:02:57.469
The Garrison Villa?

67
00:02:57.469 --> 00:03:00.469
Isn't that where your entire family lives?

68
00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:01.469
Yeah.

69
00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:02.469
The whole Garrison crew.

70
00:03:02.469 --> 00:03:03.469
Except for Damien.

71
00:03:03.469 --> 00:03:05.469
Uh, you remember him, right?

72
00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:06.699
Yeah, sure.

73
00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:09.699
Damien's a Garrison, but he's not really, uh,

74
00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:11.759
he's not really a part of the family.

75
00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:16.669
You know, Damien and I were where we were half brothers.

76
00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:18.669
He's a product of my father's affair.

77
00:03:18.669 --> 00:03:22.469
And that affair took my mother to her death.

78
00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:23.469
I didn't know that.

79
00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:24.469
I'm sorry.

80
00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:27.139
A father never acknowledged Damien.

81
00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:30.139
That's why he's always been in jail.

82
00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:31.139
I didn't realize.

83
00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:34.129
I, uh, it's probably not.

84
00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:36.129
Just to get there to leave.

85
00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:44.210
Damien is the son of the Mistress.

86
00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:46.430
I can't believe this.

87
00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.710
Well, good luck.

88
00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:49.710
We're done.

89
00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:51.710
We locked her account and froze your payments.

90
00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:52.710
Your contact is terminated.

91
00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:54.710
You can't look.

92
00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:57.710
Your sister, she's in a coma.

93
00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:59.710
You work for Damien.

94
00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:27.389
I was just, um, delivering some files to legal.

95
00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:28.389
You need anything?

96
00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:44.269
Cam, Cam.

97
00:04:44.269 --> 00:04:48.220
I like to start.

98
00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:56.930
Good job.

99
00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.970
You are dumber than I thought.

100
00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.970
Don't call me at work and just keep those messages

101
00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:05.970
and just hit her.

102
00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:06.970
Then we have to go somewhere.

103
00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:07.970
Hey.

104
00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:08.970
I've been looking for you.

105
00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.829
I was just, um...

106
00:05:11.829 --> 00:05:13.470
It doesn't matter.

107
00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:21.850
I got your room ready at the Garrison Villa so you can move in whenever...

108
00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:24.069
He's such a sweetheart.

109
00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:33.079
I kind of regret what I did now.

110
00:05:33.079 --> 00:05:36.079
The Anderson family is at the very top in the industry.

111
00:05:36.079 --> 00:05:38.240
We can link up with them.

112
00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.370
The future of our group will be secured for generations.

113
00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.750
So what is your plan?

114
00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:49.550
I've invited the Anderson family to my party next week.

115
00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:53.550
Their only daughter, Olivia, is about your age.

116
00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:58.060
Whoever marries her will be the CEO.

117
00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:13.569
And this is Olivia Anderson.

118
00:06:13.569 --> 00:06:16.569
Olivia, meet my son, Victor.

119
00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:17.569
Let's meet you, Olivia.

120
00:06:17.569 --> 00:06:19.569
That gets you drunk.

121
00:06:19.569 --> 00:06:20.569
No.

122
00:06:20.569 --> 00:06:39.560
I'm just going for snacks.

123
00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:40.560
I'm just going for snacks.

124
00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.560
They only met a decision.

125
00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.560
I'm sorry I didn't even tell.

126
00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:45.560
Do you think storage has gots us?

127
00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:50.860
You'll have my shoes.

128
00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:53.019
If shoes matter that much, I'll handle it.

129
00:06:53.019 --> 00:06:56.800
How are you?

130
00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.990
Damien Garrison.

131
00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:00.990
It's not the Garrison.

132
00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:03.990
How come this one is much more handsome?

133
00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:05.990
Well, my shoes.

134
00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:08.990
They are limited edition of Jean-Marc.

135
00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:20.089
He doesn't sell for shoes to anybody.

136
00:07:20.089 --> 00:07:21.089
Hey, Jean.

137
00:07:21.089 --> 00:07:24.920
Hey, I'm going to need a pair of your limited edition.

138
00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:27.529
Feel free to send them to my address.

139
00:07:27.529 --> 00:07:30.829
You're lucky.

140
00:07:30.829 --> 00:07:32.860
Jean is a very good friend.

141
00:07:32.860 --> 00:08:00.550
They have his days.

142
00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:22.129
When are they?

143
00:08:22.129 --> 00:08:32.700
They look great together.

144
00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:33.700
Yeah.

145
00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:35.700
Top looks from top families.

146
00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:37.700
They're made for each other.

147
00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:45.779
I guess Olivia really likes Damien.

148
00:08:45.779 --> 00:08:48.360
Good for him, I guess.

149
00:08:48.360 --> 00:09:09.200
Are we good yet?

150
00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.200
We're not slick.

151
00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:12.200
Damien, Victor was right about you.

152
00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:18.240
Victor moved you into the Garrison villa.

153
00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:19.909
Huh.

154
00:09:19.909 --> 00:09:22.009
You're starting to take notice.

155
00:09:22.009 --> 00:09:23.200
Just watch yourself.

156
00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.200
Victor was just being nice.

157
00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.200
Don't use your judgment.

158
00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.200
You two are very different.

159
00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.200
Oh, Kim.

160
00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.330
Don't fall for his act.

161
00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:32.330
You're the actor.

162
00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:33.330
I heard your story.

163
00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:34.360
What story?

164
00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:35.360
Forget it.

165
00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:36.360
Listen.

166
00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:39.350
Don't pick caught up in Victor.

167
00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:41.740
He's not who you think he is.

168
00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:45.740
You're just jealous because I moved into a place where...

169
00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:46.740
home.

170
00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:48.740
You're not exactly welcomed.

171
00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:50.740
Don't piss me off.

172
00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:52.740
Kim, are you all right in there?

173
00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:59.019
Are you all right in there?

174
00:09:59.019 --> 00:10:01.049
Victor, hi.

175
00:10:01.049 --> 00:10:04.220
Fine.

176
00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:06.220
I just needed some rest.

177
00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:08.669
I'm sorry to hear that.

178
00:10:08.669 --> 00:10:10.860
And thanks for the info about Olivia.

179
00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:13.220
Don't worry about her behavior earlier.

180
00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:15.220
It looks like we have some time now.

181
00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:16.220
What do you think you're doing?

182
00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:21.899
Are you not afraid of getting caught?

183
00:10:21.899 --> 00:10:23.889
That's the fun part.

184
00:10:23.889 --> 00:10:25.950
He doesn't seem like he cares about you though.

185
00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:27.370
I told you.

186
00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:30.360
He's a gentleman.

187
00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:31.519
Gentlemen.

188
00:10:31.519 --> 00:10:32.519
All right.

189
00:10:32.519 --> 00:10:33.779
To do some.

190
00:10:33.779 --> 00:10:34.779
To do some.

191
00:10:34.779 --> 00:10:36.320
Mm-hmm.

192
00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:37.320
Yeah.

193
00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:38.320
Keep him short, dude,

194
00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:40.669
so we can lock things in with Olivia.

195
00:10:40.669 --> 00:10:41.669
That's why you're here.

196
00:10:41.669 --> 00:10:42.669
Of course.

197
00:10:42.669 --> 00:10:46.789
Classic Damien Garrison always has him out of.

198
00:10:46.789 --> 00:10:47.789
Are you jealous?

199
00:10:47.789 --> 00:10:48.789
Me?

200
00:10:48.789 --> 00:10:52.659
Actually, I love your plan.

201
00:10:52.659 --> 00:10:55.720
I mean, I wouldn't want to be Victor's girl.

202
00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:56.720
Listen.

203
00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:58.720
Just keep him distracted.

204
00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:00.779
But don't fall for him.

205
00:11:00.779 --> 00:11:03.899
I'm glad you came with Olivia.

206
00:11:03.899 --> 00:11:05.419
You look...

207
00:11:05.419 --> 00:11:16.950
You look amazing tonight.

208
00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:17.950
Thanks.

209
00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:20.720
I look amazing every day.

210
00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:21.720
How's the food?

211
00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:23.070
How's the food?

212
00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:25.070
Um, this food, bro?

213
00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:28.070
Not even close to what I had on my childhood friends.

214
00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:31.279
Yeah.

215
00:11:31.279 --> 00:11:32.279
Sorry to interrupt.

216
00:11:32.279 --> 00:11:34.759
Victor, I really need to talk to you.

217
00:11:34.759 --> 00:11:47.120
It's important.

218
00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:48.120
That's rude.

219
00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:50.120
Didn't your parents teach you not to crush dates?

220
00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:55.350
Sorry, Olivia.

221
00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:57.350
It's about work.

222
00:11:57.350 --> 00:12:00.350
Victor, I think you could just read this contract and sign it.

223
00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:01.740
Let's do that.

224
00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:02.740
Why would you do that?

225
00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:03.740
So what?

226
00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:06.250
You just a cheap dress.

227
00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:20.149
Judging everything.

228
00:12:20.149 --> 00:12:22.149
By its price.

229
00:12:22.149 --> 00:12:23.730
Classic Olivia.

230
00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:24.730
What?

231
00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:25.730
Are you making fun of me?

232
00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:27.730
So what if I was?

233
00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:28.730
That's enough.

234
00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:32.460
Didn't you do it?

235
00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:33.460
There's something I want to show you.

236
00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:49.090
Think about it for a while.

237
00:12:49.090 --> 00:13:16.259
It's for Olivia.

238
00:13:16.259 --> 00:13:33.720
I thought you hated her.

239
00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:43.629
Love, hate, whatever.

240
00:13:43.629 --> 00:13:45.889
Yeah, I could still hate someone I propose to.

241
00:13:45.889 --> 00:13:48.460
As long as I become CEO.

242
00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:49.460
Jealous.

243
00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:50.460
Jealous, no.

244
00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:53.840
No, no.

245
00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:56.250
Find none.

246
00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:58.250
I'll be proposing to our family in that.

247
00:13:58.250 --> 00:14:00.049
You're invited to.

248
00:14:00.049 --> 00:14:04.159
I didn't know that.

249
00:14:04.159 --> 00:14:07.059
You'll receive the invitation later today?

250
00:14:07.059 --> 00:14:08.059
A congrats.

251
00:14:08.059 --> 00:14:12.210
I'm just really happy for you.

252
00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:18.120
Yeah, something base going down.

253
00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:20.120
Everyone's attention please.

254
00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:54.929
I propose that ring is insane.

255
00:14:54.929 --> 00:14:59.389
Will you marry me?

256
00:14:59.389 --> 00:15:13.769
Yes.

257
00:15:13.769 --> 00:15:16.769
Yes, that means I will.

258
00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:21.659
And I have some more news.

259
00:15:21.659 --> 00:15:39.960
Damien, as my beloved son.

260
00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:44.960
You will be the new CEO of the Garrison Group starting tomorrow.

261
00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:50.059
I'm surprised Damien ended up with Olivia.

262
00:15:50.059 --> 00:15:55.100
I thought you had a better shot.

263
00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:57.230
I'm sorry, Father.

264
00:15:57.230 --> 00:16:00.230
Do you still think there's a chance I could be CEO?

265
00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:02.710
I'll be retiring soon.

266
00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:06.759
You play your cards right.

267
00:16:06.759 --> 00:16:09.759
The resident role is still yours.

268
00:16:09.759 --> 00:16:11.759
But the board will only trust.

269
00:16:11.759 --> 00:16:14.759
A stable, married man.

270
00:16:14.759 --> 00:16:16.759
I'll find a decent woman.

271
00:16:16.759 --> 00:16:19.620
Looks like everything is going is planned,

272
00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:33.629
so if you'll just give me the account and my money,

273
00:16:33.629 --> 00:16:35.629
we could be done here.

274
00:16:35.629 --> 00:16:37.629
I'll give everything to you as balanced as possible.

275
00:16:37.629 --> 00:16:38.629
Come on out just as we do now.

276
00:16:38.629 --> 00:16:40.629
Maybe it's just a shop.

277
00:16:40.629 --> 00:16:41.629
You're wasting your time.

278
00:16:41.629 --> 00:16:46.029
Your turn is ten times a minute.

279
00:16:46.029 --> 00:16:52.230
Don't you think I'm Victor as a hypocrite?

280
00:16:52.230 --> 00:17:00.009
Congratulations on the engagement and the CEO title.

281
00:17:00.009 --> 00:17:07.369
Congratulations on the engagement and the CEO title.

282
00:17:07.369 --> 00:17:11.420
I appreciate it, Victor.

283
00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:12.450
You deserve it.

284
00:17:12.450 --> 00:17:14.450
I hope we're both here for the same thing, right?

285
00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:16.450
Garrison Family Pride.

286
00:17:16.450 --> 00:17:19.450
Of course, family first, right?

287
00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:22.640
Your dad's been bugging me about settling down.

288
00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:23.640
Keep with that.

289
00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:26.789
33.

290
00:17:26.789 --> 00:17:30.180
You and me, both married, side by side.

291
00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:32.180
I can not come in any new heights.

292
00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:33.180
Yeah.

293
00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:36.819
By the way, I'll leave you town next week,

294
00:17:36.819 --> 00:17:38.819
so I need your help.

295
00:17:38.819 --> 00:17:39.819
We get a lot of work to do.

296
00:17:39.819 --> 00:17:44.819
I can do everything.

297
00:17:44.819 --> 00:18:02.410
Excuse me, Miss Carter.

298
00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:05.730
Mr. Garrison is at the lounge.

299
00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:10.180
He is heavily drunk and unresponsive.

300
00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:12.880
Okay.

301
00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:13.880
I'll be right down.

302
00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:29.380
Jim, I didn't make CEO.

303
00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:33.240
All that work for nothing.

304
00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:54.440
Well, it should have been me.

305
00:18:54.440 --> 00:19:00.400
Just there.

306
00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:02.230
Just for a little while.

307
00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:05.980
No, Victor.

308
00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:08.400
Um, they'll be fine.

309
00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:11.200
Just get some rest, okay?

310
00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:29.380
Nothing.

311
00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:30.539
I put him to bed, okay?

312
00:19:30.539 --> 00:19:31.539
He was drunk.

313
00:19:31.539 --> 00:19:34.539
I told you to close a vicar to distracting.

314
00:19:34.539 --> 00:19:37.250
But can I actually get involved with him?

315
00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:39.279
I didn't get involved with him.

316
00:19:39.279 --> 00:19:41.279
I did exactly what you asked.

317
00:19:41.279 --> 00:19:45.279
I got close to Victor so you could chase Olivia.

318
00:19:45.279 --> 00:19:46.759
Don't play games, Jim.

319
00:19:46.759 --> 00:19:49.759
This was never about you and Victor.

320
00:19:49.759 --> 00:19:51.950
I'm not playing games.

321
00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:52.950
David.

322
00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:55.369
But don't forget.

323
00:19:55.369 --> 00:19:57.589
I'm not your puppet.

324
00:19:57.589 --> 00:20:22.720
Ah, Victor.

325
00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:24.970
I was surprised.

326
00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:25.970
Karen, can you join him?

327
00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:27.289
Sure.

328
00:20:27.289 --> 00:20:28.930
David.

329
00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:30.250
What?

330
00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:31.759
Please join us.

331
00:20:31.759 --> 00:20:32.759
So?

332
00:20:32.759 --> 00:20:46.000
Well, Kim and I were about to just have something important.

333
00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000
He's Kim is my girlfriend now.

334
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.319
Interesting.

335
00:20:50.319 --> 00:20:54.319
From a boss and assistant to boyfriend and girlfriend.

336
00:20:54.319 --> 00:20:55.319
That's something.

337
00:20:55.319 --> 00:20:56.319
Excuse me.

338
00:20:56.319 --> 00:20:58.319
I need the rest of it.

339
00:20:58.319 --> 00:21:06.619
Maybe I'll get some appetizers.

340
00:21:06.619 --> 00:21:08.619
Or do some great.
