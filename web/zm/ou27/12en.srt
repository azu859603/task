00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,039
Damien, our deal is over.

2
00:00:10,039 --> 00:00:14,599
I've done my part and you need to sort out the agency and fulfill yours, okay?

3
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:19,390
Kim, I like this.

4
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:58,079
I thought things that I never expected.

5
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,000
But you're not supposed to live in.

6
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,689
You're coming out of the restroom together.

7
00:01:02,689 --> 00:01:06,590
I'm in someone else.

8
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:09,150
You must be joking all the way up.

9
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,650
I'm in Tim, I'm going to be in loss.

10
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:23,480
What do you mean?

11
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,310
Congrats, Kim.

12
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:27,409
Want to go shopping with me tomorrow?

13
00:01:27,409 --> 00:01:31,120
I need a new dress for the engagement party.

14
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,200
I thought you might need one too?

15
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,200
Sure.
