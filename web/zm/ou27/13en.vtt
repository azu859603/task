00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:07.019
Wow, you look amazing in that dress.

2
00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:08.050
I know.

3
00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.050
I want to buy all of this dress over there.

4
00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:13.050
Sure, can I help you with that?

5
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:14.050
No need.

6
00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:16.050
I have someone else to assist me.

7
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:17.050
I want one clipping.

8
00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.050
She's pretty.

9
00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.050
Actually, she just forced laughs.

10
00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:25.289
Kim, did you get the memo?

11
00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.289
You should dress up when you come into a luxury store.

12
00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.289
Excuse me, ma'am.

13
00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:33.289
But that outfit doesn't fit the standard of our store.

14
00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:36.289
Our cheapest dress is ten times worth more than what you're wearing.

15
00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:40.420
Is this why you're inviting in here, Olivia, to insult me?

16
00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:46.420
You know, it's interesting how places with such flashy designs often contain a cheap product.

17
00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.420
People are the same, right?

18
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.659
What?

19
00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:52.700
What is this supposed to mean?

20
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:53.700
Are you calling me cheap?

21
00:00:53.700 --> 00:01:00.789
Well, this is a very unexpected sight to see.
