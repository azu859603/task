1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
I'm glad you came through. You saved me today.

2
00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:06.750
Anytime.

3
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.429
But we're not done yet.

4
00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:09.949
Damon has to pay out.

5
00:00:09.949 --> 00:00:11.949
Yeah, because if Damon's still in line and take over,

6
00:00:11.949 --> 00:00:13.550
it's bad for both of our families.

7
00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:15.250
Exactly.

8
00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.760
My father's health is failing,

9
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.519
and he's going to decide between

10
00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:22.429
Danny and me as to who's going to be president.

11
00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:26.510
My husband is the only one right choice with that job.

12
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.570
I can deal with this embarrassment.

13
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.649
You have to fix it for me.

14
00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:39.570
Or I have my family pull all business from the garrison work.

15
00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:41.780
What do you want me to do?

16
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.429
Announce your retirement before the wedding.

17
00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.539
Make victor president.

18
00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.420
Fine. I'll think about it.

19
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.100
That's a tough ask.

20
00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:59.020
Okay. I'll wait.

21
00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.659
But remember,

22
00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.659
you have to give me an answer before the wedding.

23
00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:08.299
Or I might not show up just like Damon did today.
