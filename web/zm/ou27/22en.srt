1
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:04,769
What are you doing here?

2
00:00:04,769 --> 00:00:07,769
Oh, I'm going to do the file, urgent.

3
00:00:07,769 --> 00:00:19,600
The doctor said painting could help with your recovery.

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,600
You run a coma for so long that you'll need to rebuild your memories step by step.

5
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:30,899
Just paint whatever comes to mind.

6
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:42,200
I know. I kept having this dream of something when I was in the coma.

7
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:48,679
It had this, like, weird shape, like a symbol or something.

8
00:00:48,679 --> 00:01:19,290
Can't look.

9
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:24,810
The Garrison family crust?

10
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:26,420
What did you say?

11
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,829
Jane, what is this that you just painted?

12
00:01:29,829 --> 00:01:34,150
I don't know, actually. It just came into my mind.

13
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:37,379
I have a big sense of having seen it somewhere, but...

14
00:01:37,379 --> 00:01:39,379
Do you know anyone from the Garrison group?

15
00:01:39,379 --> 00:01:41,980
Which Garrison family?

16
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:46,209
You mean the one who owns the famous Garrison group?

17
00:01:46,209 --> 00:01:47,209
Everyone knows them.

18
00:01:47,209 --> 00:01:48,400
No.

19
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:52,879
Jane, be serious. Have you ever met anyone from the Garrison family?

20
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:55,069
Of course not.

21
00:01:55,069 --> 00:01:59,310
Have you seen this anywhere?

22
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:05,390
Yes, but I think I know who it belongs to.

23
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:17,979
What were you thinking? Why would you jump in if you can't swim? Are you nuts?

24
00:02:17,979 --> 00:02:23,919
Creating mom's oatmeal raisin cookies.

25
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:28,550
I miss mom and dad, but at least we have each other.

26
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:32,740
We just need to focus on looking forward.

27
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:38,009
I know. I'm so glad I have you, Kim.

28
00:02:38,009 --> 00:02:42,099
You know what? Why don't I go down to the cafeteria and see if they have any cookies?

29
00:02:42,099 --> 00:02:49,419
I'll be back in 10 minutes, okay?

30
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:51,419
It's only been 10 seconds, Kim.

31
00:02:51,419 --> 00:03:11,939
Victor Garrison.

32
00:03:11,939 --> 00:03:31,449
I have a man here who tried to kill my sister.

33
00:03:31,449 --> 00:03:33,449
We've got him cornered at the central hospital.

34
00:03:33,449 --> 00:03:37,280
He's also connected to a murder.

35
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:43,539
What are you doing here?

36
00:03:43,539 --> 00:03:45,819
Need a place high from Olivia?

37
00:03:45,819 --> 00:03:47,050
Seriously?

38
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:50,719
I haven't been keeping up. Very close. I am your sister.

39
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:53,360
I heard somebody tried drugging her.

40
00:03:53,360 --> 00:04:01,819
It must have been Victor.

41
00:04:01,819 --> 00:04:12,460
You need to find a safe place for your sister.

42
00:04:13,939 --> 00:04:17,990
Jane is asleep.

43
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:18,990
Thank you.

44
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:27,360
What do you think about the accident?

45
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,680
I don't know all the details, but Victor is dangerous.

46
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,310
If he feels sorry, he'll do anything.

47
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:37,310
What makes you so sure of this?

48
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:43,379
I'm pretty sure he's the reason my mom died.

49
00:04:43,379 --> 00:04:47,339
My mother wasn't what most people think.

50
00:04:47,339 --> 00:04:57,660
Victor's mom had post-partum depression and after that, my dad got remarried and had me.

51
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:05,259
When I was 12, we got in a fight and she came out looking for me.

52
00:05:05,259 --> 00:05:20,560
She was looking for me and she fell down a slope.

53
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:26,779
I was right there at the bottom and saw everything.

54
00:05:26,779 --> 00:05:32,720
The rocks, and there was one more thing too.

55
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:38,569
There was a boy who was thick.

56
00:05:38,569 --> 00:05:48,350
After that, my father had blamed me for my own mother's death.

57
00:05:48,350 --> 00:06:15,480
It's reveal everything at the wedding.

58
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:22,480
It's my honor to present Victor Garrison as the new president of the Garrison Group.

59
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:28,379
Thank you, everyone.

60
00:06:28,379 --> 00:06:29,379
It's an honor.

61
00:06:29,379 --> 00:06:31,379
I'm ready to take this coming from new heights.

62
00:06:31,379 --> 00:06:37,389
So as you all know, I've been involved with some financial fraud and even murders.

63
00:06:37,389 --> 00:06:44,100
I, uh, script.

64
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:51,250
Why did you try to kill my sister?

65
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,050
I don't know anymore.

66
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:55,050
Stop acting so innocent, Victor.

67
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:57,050
You're a man confessed on the spot.

68
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:02,509
You sent him to kill my sister.

69
00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:08,220
Victor Garrison, you're under arrest.

70
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:12,220
We found a Garrison family crest with your fingerprints on it in a wrecked car.

71
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:16,069
Don't come any closer.

72
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:17,069
I swear I'll kill her.

73
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:20,069
You may have spotted that car accident, but you're not going to get lucky this time.

74
00:07:20,069 --> 00:07:25,220
You killed my parents and almost my sister because of me.

75
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:27,220
Why do you want me dead?

76
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,220
What?

77
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,220
You're dead.

78
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:32,699
So I was right about the family scandals.

79
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:34,699
Just let her go, Victor.

80
00:07:34,699 --> 00:07:36,699
I'm right here.

81
00:07:36,699 --> 00:07:38,699
I'll just let her go.

82
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:42,540
Shh.

83
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:43,540
Another pawn.

84
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:44,540
A real scheme.

85
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:48,540
Another woman whose life is in danger because of your existence.

86
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,540
What are you talking about?

87
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,540
Why do all of this?

88
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,540
Because I hate you, Damien.

89
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:56,540
Hey, you and your entire family and your mother?

90
00:07:56,540 --> 00:08:00,110
I pushed me on that day myself.

91
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:03,220
Oh, it was you.

92
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,220
I knew it.

93
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,220
Yeah.

94
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,220
I was there that day.

95
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,220
I made sure she didn't come back in that fall.

96
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,220
Now another woman's life is in danger because of your existence.

97
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:13,569
Pushed her off the glue.

98
00:08:13,569 --> 00:08:23,160
Kim get hurt because of me, Victor.

99
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:27,160
I'll give you everything my life, my fortune.

100
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,319
Please just let her go.

101
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:31,639
You think you can buy me off?

102
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:33,860
It's too late for that.

103
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:37,019
I know why you hate me.

104
00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:39,019
It's because of your mother.

105
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,019
Today I talk about my mother.

106
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:43,019
You think your mother killed herself because of me?

107
00:08:43,019 --> 00:08:47,779
I took her own life because of postpartum depression.

108
00:08:47,779 --> 00:08:50,779
She loved you very much.

109
00:08:50,779 --> 00:08:53,509
But she was unhappy.

110
00:08:53,509 --> 00:08:58,399
My mother died because she had me.

111
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:59,399
Kim.

112
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:14,129
Kim.

113
00:09:14,129 --> 00:09:39,269
You're the true heir to our family's legacy.

114
00:09:39,269 --> 00:09:45,269
I hereby declare Damien as the sole heir to the Garrison fortune.

115
00:09:45,269 --> 00:09:57,009
Is it any chance for us?

116
00:09:57,009 --> 00:09:59,009
Good things be different?

117
00:09:59,009 --> 00:10:00,779
Are we asking that?

118
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:02,700
Look around.

119
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,700
What do you think?

120
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,700
All right.

121
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:10,980
I see that that was not really a competition.

122
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,980
I should have no better.

123
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:19,370
You know, Olivia, I never really saw it as a competition.

124
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:23,330
We all deserve better lives.

125
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:27,019
And I hope you find what you're looking for.

126
00:10:27,019 --> 00:10:28,019
Thanks.

127
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:29,019
I'll set off our abroad.

128
00:10:29,019 --> 00:10:31,789
Good luck to both of you.

129
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,100
You're doing great.

130
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,100
I mean, pretty soon you'll be walking just like you were before.

131
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,610
You couldn't have done this without you.

132
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:57,250
Thank you for everything.

133
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:04,759
Hey, what's up?

134
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:05,759
Kim.

135
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:06,759
How are you?

136
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:07,759
You know how I am.

137
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:09,759
I'm jobless and broke.

138
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:11,759
Stop joking.

139
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:13,759
You're a mega influencer.

140
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:15,759
Try logging into your account.

141
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:16,759
It was unlocked.

142
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:17,759
And check your bank account.

143
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:19,759
There's two million dollars coming in.

144
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:20,759
Thank you.

145
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:22,759
That is very generous.

146
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:23,860
Oh, Kim don't.

147
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:24,860
I was a jerk.

148
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:25,860
Sorry.

149
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:28,860
But really, you should thank Damien Garrison.

150
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,860
He's a real deal with a big heart.

151
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:34,860
Speaking of Damien, I'd like to invite him to my first show back.

152
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:50,730
It's time we clear the Garrison controversy once and for all.

153
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:55,730
To sum it all up, Victor Garrison has been arrested for falsifying financial reports.

154
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:59,649
And there are Damien's new leadership.

155
00:11:59,649 --> 00:12:02,649
The Garrison crew is moving towards integrity.

156
00:12:02,649 --> 00:12:20,139
If you're interested, come to Grandview Villa and find me.

157
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:44,610
I want you to be seen in front of the Garrison.

158
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:47,149
Together, we can make a huge impact.

159
00:12:47,149 --> 00:12:49,149
How much do you offer?

160
00:12:49,149 --> 00:12:52,590
Let's see if you'll get market rates.

161
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:53,590
That's my girlfriend.

162
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:55,590
You get anything you want to just ask.

163
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:58,039
Sounds like a plan.

164
00:12:58,039 --> 00:12:59,070
And then...

165
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:03,629
We got there in my trust first.

166
00:13:03,629 --> 00:13:04,629
I was the challenge.

167
00:13:04,629 --> 00:13:06,629
You want me to throw myself into the pool again?

168
00:13:06,629 --> 00:13:09,389
No.

169
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:10,389
I'll teach you as well.
