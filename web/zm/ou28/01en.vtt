00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.500
Look, it was your grandfather's decision for you to marry Michelle.

2
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:11.000
I basically watched her grow up and she spent so much time in this house.

3
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I know she can be a little bookish and quiet, but she's really very smart.

4
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Look, grandma, we talked about this. I'm not marrying just anybody.

5
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Maybe you've got a waltz with you and have a woman fall from the sky right in front of me that I'd consider.

6
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
God will do no such thing. Don't be silly, Luca.

7
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.979
I'm afraid about you.

8
00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:43.890
Chill.

9
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.460
Are you all right?

10
00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.460
Yeah, I'm fine.

11
00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.679
This dog was stuck in the tree so I figured I'd help her out.

12
00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:54.679
Um, did I scare you guys?

13
00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:55.679
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:55.679 --> 00:00:56.710
Oh no.

15
00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.710
Actually, your timing couldn't be better.

16
00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.709
Luca, what were you saying about a woman falling from the sky?

17
00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:08.890
What the heck?

18
00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.400
This is what God wants.

19
00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:27.390
I thought it was a business trip in Europe, so I didn't have time to get you a ring, but I'm going to make it up to you, I promise.

20
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.099
It's a shame my glasses broke. I don't even get to see what he looked like.

21
00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:42.209
Well, if he is Amy's grandson, he's got to be a good person.

22
00:01:42.209 --> 00:02:05.409
My study abroad application got approved? Thank you.

23
00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:06.409
You're back.

24
00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.740
We're having to even see each other.

25
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.900
You guys can pick you up so you can come home together.

26
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.900
Okay, we'll do.

27
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.409
Michelle!

28
00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:20.210
Hey!

29
00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:25.849
Yeah.

30
00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:30.849
Your wife has got a white suitcase and she's dyed her hair red.

31
00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:31.849
You can't miss her.

32
00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:32.849
Got it.

33
00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:33.849
And don't forget the flowers.

34
00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:42.539
Oh, it won't.

35
00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:43.539
Ooh.

36
00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:44.539
Welcome home.

37
00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:47.050
It's so good to see you.

38
00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.990
Thank you.

39
00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.990
Red hair white suitcase.

40
00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:56.340
So my wife has got a boyfriend.

41
00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.340
Great.

42
00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.680
Thank you.

43
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.219
So sweet.

44
00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:02.219
Get in, cousin.

45
00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:03.219
Let's go.
