1
00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.020
Taking back to the office.

2
00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:04.019
Get in, cousin. Let's go.

3
00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:10.449
Um, Amy told me that Lucas was gonna pick me up.

4
00:00:10.449 --> 00:00:13.449
I think I'm the only one here to pick you up.

5
00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:17.429
Mm-hmm. Shoot.

6
00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:20.429
I'm gonna be late. Will you give me a ride?

7
00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:25.280
Of course. Let's go.

8
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.280
What was I thinking?

9
00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.280
A husband who hasn't shown up once during our marriage?

10
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:44.200
Of course he's not picking me up at the airport.

11
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.200
He's the head of the E.P. Secretary Department.

12
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.200
It's my duty to tell you that arriving 15 minutes early is basic, etiquette.

13
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:58.200
Oh. Well, should I remind you that as a secretary, it's your job to be nice to your coworkers?

14
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.200
Alright, let's not do this. The C.O.B. here very soon.

15
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.420
I should remind you, the boss doesn't like work conflicts.

16
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.420
Alright, he's late because he went to the airport to become his wife.

17
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.420
Otherwise, you might have lost your job day one.

18
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.420
They must really love each other.

19
00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.420
My husband didn't even show up.

20
00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:17.420
Mm-hmm.

21
00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.390
Hi, Mr. Marty. Mr. Robert.

22
00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:34.579
He looks kind of familiar.
