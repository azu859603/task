00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:04.870
Hey, did I hear this right?

2
00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:09.550
The CEO was out of the country for four years and now he's just got back recently.

3
00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:15.769
Yeah, in just four years he built branches overseas, bought out local businesses, expanded

4
00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:17.269
this company worldwide.

5
00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:18.269
It's really impressive.

6
00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:19.269
No!

7
00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:20.269
Please!

8
00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:21.269
Wait!

9
00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:22.269
Give me another chance!

10
00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:23.269
Go!

11
00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:24.269
Please don't fire me!

12
00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.269
Come on.

13
00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:26.269
What happened?

14
00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:27.269
Some people can't help flirting with the boss.

15
00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.269
Don't get any ideas like that.

16
00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:31.269
It doesn't like those kind of women.

17
00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:33.270
You don't have to worry about that.

18
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:41.439
I won't do that.

19
00:00:41.439 --> 00:00:46.859
At the business meeting in 20 minutes, if someone can clean the stain and tend, I'm making my

20
00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:47.859
personal assistant.

21
00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:50.659
Being the CEO's personal assistant, can you imagine?

22
00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:54.700
You'd get to go to all the banquets and meet all the private clientele.

23
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.880
How could anyone clean it in 10 minutes?

24
00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:58.880
It's impossible.

25
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.880
I have an idea, sir.

26
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.880
If I may, you see that suit.

27
00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.790
That's the latest TX model.

28
00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.549
It's also around your ground.

29
00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.280
I can just buy him a new one.

30
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.400
It's something somebody like you probably can't even imagine.

31
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.040
Unless of course you've found yourself a rich husband, like, right now?
