1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,750
Maybe I should give her a chance to explain herself.

2
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:29,329
I guess I'll just surprise you, man.

3
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:31,329
Any idea what to bring on a date?

4
00:00:31,329 --> 00:00:33,420
No idea, sir.

5
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,420
Maybe ask Michelle.

6
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:43,100
Michelle, a CEO would like to speak with you.

7
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:47,179
What gifts would I bring on a date?

8
00:00:47,179 --> 00:00:49,179
I think it depends on your relationship with her.

9
00:00:49,179 --> 00:00:51,539
She's my wife.

10
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:53,539
Have you bought her gifts before?

11
00:00:53,539 --> 00:00:58,789
No, I haven't had a chance to yet, but I'm going to make it up to her.

12
00:00:58,789 --> 00:01:01,789
Well, I mean, girls love sparkly jewelry.

13
00:01:01,789 --> 00:01:03,789
Maybe diamonds would be a good choice.

14
00:01:03,789 --> 00:01:06,790
Even if she doesn't wear them, she could use them as like a collector's item.

15
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:09,790
That's good. They do like diamonds.

16
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:10,790
That's a great idea.

17
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:13,790
Well, I have a pretty unique diamond ring, so...

18
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:17,530
Get her anything else you might like and make it a limited edition.

19
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:20,299
Now I have to serve the best.

20
00:01:20,299 --> 00:01:21,359
You got it.

21
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:27,620
Hey, Michelle.

22
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:30,620
Look, I know the boss is being very nice to you,

23
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:32,620
but you can see how much he loves his wife,

24
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:35,620
and I don't want you to think that you can replace the Mrs. ring.

25
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:36,620
No, don't worry.

26
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:40,620
I'm here for the job and the money, not a shot at the CDO.

27
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:44,620
Good. Well, once you grab everything, you can leave.

28
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:45,620
Okay, thanks.

29
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:50,370
Your wife's house boss?

30
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:52,780
I actually like it.

31
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:59,540
Hey, can you go to the store and give me some size house?

32
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:00,540
Please, I need it for the recipe.

33
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,540
No, I need to...

34
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:02,540
Hey!

35
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:08,500
Go with you boss.

36
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,349
No.
