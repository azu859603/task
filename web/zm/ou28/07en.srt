1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:09,289
That was quick.

2
00:00:09,289 --> 00:00:10,480
Hi.

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,480
Who are you?

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,559
Michelle's house?

5
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:17,559
Yeah.

6
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:18,589
Michelle Harvard.

7
00:00:18,589 --> 00:00:19,589
Yes.

8
00:00:19,589 --> 00:00:21,589
You live with Michelle Harvard?

9
00:00:21,589 --> 00:00:22,589
Of course.

10
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:25,589
They're already living together and here I am being excused for.

11
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:27,589
Man, what are you doing?

12
00:00:27,589 --> 00:00:29,589
Thomas, what's going on?

13
00:00:29,589 --> 00:00:31,850
I'm going to make you pay for this.

14
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:32,850
Are you okay?

15
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:33,850
What happened?

16
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:35,850
I'm gonna make you pay.

17
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,850
I'm not going to make you pay.

18
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:39,850
I'm not going in a lot.

19
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:41,850
I'm not going anywhere.

20
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,850
Joseph, all right?

21
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:44,850
I'm not going anywhere.

22
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,850
I'm not going anywhere.

23
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:47,850
George, no.

24
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:48,850
It's okay.

25
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:49,850
I'm not going anywhere.

26
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:50,850
No.

27
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:51,850
No.

28
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:52,850
No.

29
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:53,850
No.

30
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:54,850
No.

31
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:55,850
No.

32
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:56,850
No.

33
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:57,850
No.

34
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:58,850
No.

35
00:00:58,850 --> 00:00:59,850
No.
