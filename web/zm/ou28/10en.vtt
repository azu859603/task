00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
Who is it?

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Thank goodness it's not his wife.

3
00:00:06.419 --> 00:00:17.899
We don't need a room clean right now. Thanks. Thanks, boss.

4
00:00:17.899 --> 00:00:34.159
What am I thinking? How could I mistake her for Michelle?

5
00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:35.159
Yeah?

6
00:00:35.159 --> 00:00:39.159
Lucas, what is going on? I heard you're getting a divorce.

7
00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:44.219
Yeah. I won't be like my father. I won't be with a woman who cheats on me.

8
00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.219
Well, Michelle would never do something like that.

9
00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.219
I thought so too.

10
00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:50.219
Okay.

11
00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.219
The neighbor's dog was stuck in the tree so I figured I'd help her out.

12
00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.219
Um, did I scare you guys? I'm sorry.

13
00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:00.420
I just told my kids to go through what I went through.

14
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.420
Oh, Lucas.

15
00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.420
It's okay. I'll figure it out.

16
00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.420
I just want you to be happy.

17
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:17.010
I won't be grown up. I scared her away, huh?
