1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.859
I'm on Michelle. You're married. Get it together.

2
00:00:13.859 --> 00:00:19.399
Mm-hmm. Don't be late for the party tomorrow.

3
00:00:19.399 --> 00:00:32.990
Sorry. No, I'm through without an invitation.

4
00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:39.340
I think... I think that way... Ella?

5
00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.340
Is this a friend of yours? Looks like she could use my help.

6
00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.340
No. I have no idea who she is, Mr. Schluster.

7
00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.340
But you're my date. You're not trying to find a new one already?

8
00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.340
No, of course not.

9
00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.340
AC, the boss is looking to see how we handle things.

10
00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.399
I can get into this party without an invitation, and you can't.

11
00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:04.400
You're not fit to be his personal assistant.

12
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.400
So get ready to get fired.

13
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.540
She doesn't have an invitation. Make sure she stays out, please.

14
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.540
Come on, didn't you see how she just tried to use my date to get in?

15
00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:21.459
No. All right. I'll see you outside.

16
00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:23.500
Loser.

17
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.109
Man, you need to leave.

18
00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:32.340
Please. My boss is waiting for me.

19
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.340
I need to get inside, otherwise he won't find me.

20
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.340
There is no boss here for you. Come on. Let's go.

21
00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.340
She can't be that terrible, can she?

22
00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.340
I mean, why else are they kicking her out?

23
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.340
Man, if you refuse to leave, we are going to have to take it by force.

24
00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.340
Don't you dare take her away.

25
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.060
Oh, my God. That's Lucas, the youngest CEO from the Forbes list.

26
00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.310
Sorry, I'm late. I heard you're trying to take her away. Is that right?

27
00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.140
It was a misunderstanding, sir. I didn't know the lady was with you.

28
00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.239
It was my mistake.

29
00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:06.750
So can we go now?

30
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:14.830
Oh, yeah, of course, of course.

31
00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.830
Well, being with us, of course.

32
00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.889
Right, 15 minutes away, there's that.

33
00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:20.889
Understood.

34
00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:39.090
Seems you don't like that beautiful lady very much.

35
00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.180
No, of course I like her.

36
00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.180
I heard that famous actress Megan grew up with Lucas.

37
00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.340
Why don't you think it was taken away by another woman?

38
00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.520
Pester, you are an angel.

39
00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.520
Oh, I don't help out for free, then.

40
00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:03.590
Don't worry. Your wish will soon be granted.

41
00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:10.810
Is it true?

42
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.900
I heard Lucas got himself an escort to take him to all these public events.

43
00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.900
I sort of like being his wife.

44
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.189
Yeah, and he was just defending her at the door.

45
00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:24.310
Where is she? Oh, my God.

46
00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.310
This is the first time seeing Lucas being a date to a party.

47
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.310
There she is.

48
00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.310
Star of the evening.

49
00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.310
I can see why Lucas chose her to be his date. She is stunning.

50
00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.310
Lucas, my man.

51
00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.310
I heard you planning to build a shopping center.

52
00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.310
I have a great piece of land. I can make a decent offer on it.

53
00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:42.310
Come on.

54
00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:52.479
We all know Lucas is mine.

55
00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:56.020
Out of here, he's worth this low-life bitch.

56
00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.400
What?

57
00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.400
You really think that cheap crap is going to impress Lucas?

58
00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.400
He's mine.

59
00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.400
Are you his wife?

60
00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.780
Because I seem to remember her name being Michelle.

61
00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.780
That girl? Please.

62
00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.780
Lucas and I grew up together. She's just some random girl that he ran into one day.

63
00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.779
Why are you still here?

64
00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:18.779
I said, get out of here.

65
00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:22.779
I'm sorry, but it's my job to attend this event with my boss, so no.

66
00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:24.779
I'm not going to just get out of here.

67
00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:30.500
What the hell is your problem?

68
00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:31.730
There.

69
00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.730
Your dress is ruined.

70
00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:34.730
Now you have a reason to go.

71
00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:36.730
Seriously? What is the matter with you?

72
00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:38.730
Do you even know who I am?

73
00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:40.730
Lucas, I do know.

74
00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:42.730
In fact, I know you have a new movie coming out.

75
00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.730
You wouldn't want the media to find out about what you just did, would you?

76
00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.370
Because I got it all on camera.

77
00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.810
You're threatening me?

78
00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:57.230
You're threatening me?

79
00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:05.939
This woman was threatening to ruin my career because she's your assistant.

80
00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:06.939
Fire her.

81
00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:08.939
I think she was doing exactly what I wanted me to do.

82
00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:11.579
You have a problem with that?

83
00:05:11.579 --> 00:05:14.569
Lucas, are you taking her side?

84
00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:21.970
I'm just gonna go clean up.

85
00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:34.050
This boss is so protected.

86
00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:35.050
I can't embarrass him.

87
00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:43.959
What are you doing? This is the ladies' room.

88
00:05:43.959 --> 00:05:48.910
What are you doing? This is the ladies' room.

89
00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:51.910
I know. That's why I want the door.

90
00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:53.910
Now it's just you and me.

91
00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:55.910
Get away from me!

92
00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:58.040
And Lucas is secretary, so...

93
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.040
He really think Lucas gives a shit about you.

94
00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.040
He just happens to decide, Megan.

95
00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.040
But I'm offering him land at a fraction of the cost.

96
00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.040
Saving him billions.

97
00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.040
Do you think you work billions to Lucas?

98
00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.040
You're lying.

99
00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.040
Lucas would never.

100
00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.040
Turn his back on his employees.

101
00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.040
We'll see about that.

102
00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.040
Oh!

103
00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:41.079
I'm fine.

104
00:06:41.079 --> 00:06:52.500
Yeah, I am so sorry.

105
00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:58.540
Lucas, I was just assaulted by your secretary.

106
00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:00.540
I want to find or I'll deal us off.

107
00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:01.540
Are you kidding me?

108
00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:03.540
You're the one who assaulted me.

109
00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:06.610
Our business dealing with the Sylvester family are done.

110
00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:07.610
What?

111
00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:10.639
Come on, we've been running the most successful business here.

112
00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:12.639
I can make your family disappear.

113
00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:16.790
Yeah, hi, I'd like the Sylvester family to go bankrupt.

114
00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:17.790
That's ridiculous.

115
00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:19.790
Our family's been around for decades.

116
00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:35.740
All our stocks just plummeted.

117
00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:36.970
We're bankrupt.

118
00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:37.970
Yeah, I'm sorry.

119
00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:41.819
All right, I was wrong.

120
00:07:41.819 --> 00:07:44.819
I should have tried anything with you, Sam Terry.

121
00:07:44.819 --> 00:07:47.139
But it's on my fault.

122
00:07:47.139 --> 00:07:48.139
Not my families.

123
00:07:48.139 --> 00:07:50.139
It's too late for that, man.

124
00:07:50.139 --> 00:07:51.139
Michelle, please.

125
00:07:51.139 --> 00:07:53.139
Talk to you for me.

126
00:07:53.139 --> 00:07:54.139
Will you?

127
00:07:54.139 --> 00:07:56.139
I would, but...

128
00:07:56.139 --> 00:07:58.139
I'm just a secretary.

129
00:07:58.139 --> 00:07:59.139
Remember?

130
00:07:59.139 --> 00:08:01.519
There's nothing I can do.

131
00:08:01.519 --> 00:08:03.550
Get out of our face.

132
00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:04.709
No!

133
00:08:04.709 --> 00:08:07.759
Thank you.

134
00:08:07.759 --> 00:08:13.480
She's protecting our employees from getting bullied.

135
00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:17.959
But without the Sylvester deal, you're gonna lose billions?

136
00:08:17.959 --> 00:08:21.959
There's no point in doing business at the cost of our implicit.

137
00:08:21.959 --> 00:08:25.019
Plus, plenty of companies want to work with us.

138
00:08:25.019 --> 00:08:27.019
So next time, when something like that happens,

139
00:08:27.019 --> 00:08:29.220
it comes straight to us.

140
00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:30.660
We've got your back.

141
00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:32.460
Okay?

142
00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:36.220
There really is a stand-up guy,

143
00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:38.220
unlike my ex-husband.

144
00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:40.220
The boss's wife is so lucky.

145
00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:42.350
Let's get back.

146
00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:45.659
I should, uh, take you off.

147
00:08:45.659 --> 00:08:50.789
Thanks.

148
00:08:50.789 --> 00:08:53.940
She's really pretty.

149
00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:57.070
Wait, ready to hear a woman named Michelle

150
00:08:57.070 --> 00:08:59.070
in that ring necklace?

151
00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:01.580
Could it be... Michelle?

152
00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:09.149
Can't get enough of her, can ya?

153
00:09:09.149 --> 00:09:10.440
Stop this.

154
00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:11.440
Come off.

155
00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:12.440
I'll stop obsessing about her.

156
00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:13.440
I'm not.

157
00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:14.440
All right, all right, I know.

158
00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:15.440
She's not your type.

159
00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:17.919
What makes you set up?

160
00:09:17.919 --> 00:09:19.919
Well, but someone of your status

161
00:09:19.919 --> 00:09:21.919
allowed a woman you liked to wear,

162
00:09:21.919 --> 00:09:22.919
dressed like a hat.

163
00:09:22.919 --> 00:09:23.919
But seriously,

164
00:09:23.919 --> 00:09:25.919
I have never seen you defend a woman like that before.

165
00:09:25.919 --> 00:09:27.919
You shut Meghan up.

166
00:09:27.919 --> 00:09:28.919
You lost out on a billion dollar deal,

167
00:09:28.919 --> 00:09:29.919
all for that girl?

168
00:09:29.919 --> 00:09:34.360
Well, I'm just out here for what's right.

169
00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.740
Well, if you don't like her,

170
00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:38.740
can I shoot my shot?

171
00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:42.080
Go ahead.

172
00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:43.080
Oh, yeah?

173
00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:44.269
We'll see you about that.

174
00:09:44.269 --> 00:09:50.940
Hey, where you headed?

175
00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:52.940
Can I give you a ride?

176
00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:57.789
My assistant doesn't need a ride.

177
00:09:57.789 --> 00:10:15.299
Drive.

178
00:10:15.299 --> 00:10:20.700
Oh, you'll always get shotgun if you ride in my car.

179
00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:24.649
Don't talk to Anthony.

180
00:10:24.649 --> 00:10:37.500
He's a boy boy.

181
00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:39.039
You're a husband.

182
00:10:39.039 --> 00:10:47.440
Yeah, we got married about four years ago.

183
00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:48.440
Oh, did you lose something?

184
00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:53.259
Where did it go?

185
00:10:53.259 --> 00:10:54.259
Shoot.

186
00:10:54.259 --> 00:10:56.990
That's where I dropped it.

187
00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:59.470
What's wrong with you lose something?

188
00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:01.110
No.

189
00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:02.500
I don't need it anymore.

190
00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:05.559
Losing the ring he gave me when we're getting divorced,

191
00:11:05.559 --> 00:11:13.899
maybe it's meant to happen.

192
00:11:13.899 --> 00:11:14.899
I'm so sorry.

193
00:11:14.899 --> 00:11:18.950
I just got really distracted for a second.

194
00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:19.950
Where do you live?

195
00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:20.950
I'll take you home.

196
00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:21.950
Um, it's okay.

197
00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:23.950
Actually, I'm having someone pick me up.

198
00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:27.940
Is that, uh, is that your husband?

199
00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:32.690
Us.

200
00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:42.210
Michelle, how did you get for you?

201
00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:50.580
Isn't this supposed to be for your wife?

202
00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:53.419
She's not going to need it.

203
00:11:53.419 --> 00:11:54.419
Did they fight?

204
00:11:54.419 --> 00:11:57.419
Maybe I'll keep it for him until they make up.

205
00:11:57.419 --> 00:12:07.950
What's this?

206
00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:12.769
That's the guy my wife is cheating on me.

207
00:12:12.769 --> 00:12:31.500
You okay?

208
00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:37.049
How to drink too many at the party.

209
00:12:37.049 --> 00:12:49.299
I want the divorce finalized as soon as possible.

210
00:12:49.299 --> 00:12:51.299
Name your terms, whatever you want.

211
00:12:51.299 --> 00:12:52.710
Don't worry.

212
00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:53.710
I'm fine with leaving with nothing.

213
00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:54.710
Fine.

214
00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:56.710
My lawyers will be in touch.

215
00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:59.950
Great.

216
00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:01.049
Bastard.

217
00:13:01.049 --> 00:13:03.049
Nobody wants to be your wife anyway.

218
00:13:03.049 --> 00:13:06.370
Michelle, I'm sorry for what my wife did to you.

219
00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:14.129
Then make sure you suffer as little as possible.

220
00:13:14.129 --> 00:13:15.129
Good morning.

221
00:13:15.129 --> 00:13:20.639
Are you?

222
00:13:20.639 --> 00:13:24.019
You have some nerve showing your face around here.

223
00:13:24.019 --> 00:13:25.019
What do you mean?

224
00:13:25.019 --> 00:13:27.019
What do I mean?

225
00:13:27.019 --> 00:13:35.019
What do you manage to seduce all the boys at this company

226
00:13:35.019 --> 00:13:38.019
when you already have so many men?

227
00:13:38.019 --> 00:13:40.019
Those aren't my boyfriends.

228
00:13:40.019 --> 00:13:42.269
They don't need to be your boyfriends for you to seduce them.

229
00:13:42.269 --> 00:13:46.269
No wonder you got the personal assistant position.

230
00:13:46.269 --> 00:13:49.269
I thought she got into the company because of her professionalism.

231
00:13:49.269 --> 00:13:52.269
But I didn't expect that she used that kind of talent.

232
00:13:52.269 --> 00:13:57.269
The trash worker that affects the company like her should be kicked out immediately.

233
00:13:57.269 --> 00:13:58.460
No, you guys.

234
00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:00.460
Those photos are taken out of contact.

235
00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:03.970
Somebody slandering me.

236
00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:05.970
You take the personal assistant position.

237
00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:13.610
Now I'm going to make sure that you leave this company in the most humiliating way.

238
00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:18.580
Didn't you hear us?

239
00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:23.059
Trash like you that's ruining the company's reputation needs to be taken out.

240
00:14:23.059 --> 00:14:26.600
We all know you're dirty.

241
00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:40.669
Stop playing innocent professors.

242
00:14:40.669 --> 00:14:43.669
No wonder why they gave you those good grades.

243
00:14:43.669 --> 00:14:50.029
Do what you're wearing every day to class.

244
00:14:50.029 --> 00:14:54.299
How pathetic.

245
00:14:54.299 --> 00:14:55.299
What's going on here?

246
00:14:55.299 --> 00:15:01.590
Sir, please don't listen to her.

247
00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:03.590
She's going to tell you something but it's not true.

248
00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:05.590
Look, her photos are all over the internet.

249
00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:07.590
They've already cost so much damage to the company.

250
00:15:10.169 --> 00:15:12.169
Someone is trying to set me up.

251
00:15:12.169 --> 00:15:16.230
Sir, the photos don't show any signs of being fake.

252
00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:22.230
And I highly doubt that everybody here would be pleased to hear you defend her again.

253
00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:23.230
That's right.

254
00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:25.460
What do you have to say to this?

255
00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:30.740
Those photos were taken at the party last night and I'm pretty sure we'll have something to do with it.

256
00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:34.740
Well, if you believe someone is framing you, you need to find evidence and fight back against it.

257
00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:37.029
You're my personal assistant.

258
00:15:37.029 --> 00:15:40.029
Crisis management is a big part of the job.

259
00:15:40.029 --> 00:15:46.059
So if you can't figure this out in the next two hours, well, you might not be competent enough for the job.

260
00:15:46.059 --> 00:15:56.629
And we'll have to release you.

261
00:15:56.629 --> 00:15:57.629
John, help out Michelle.

262
00:15:57.629 --> 00:16:00.629
Find out what's behind this mess report back to me.

263
00:16:00.629 --> 00:16:04.350
Understood.

264
00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:06.350
Why does boss care about Michelle so much?

265
00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:11.230
Stop pretending like you're working.

266
00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:14.230
I'm sorry, you're probably on the hunt for your next man.

267
00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:16.230
Aren't you?

268
00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:21.120
It's indeed Ella who framed.

269
00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:23.250
Ma'am, you've been fired?

270
00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:25.250
I'm asking, please leave the company.

271
00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:27.860
And who the hell are you?

272
00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:32.460
Oh, if you know, I got this job through my grandmother's connections.

273
00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:34.059
Go on now.

274
00:16:34.059 --> 00:16:35.059
Oh, come on.

275
00:16:35.059 --> 00:16:36.059
Let's go with me.

276
00:16:36.059 --> 00:16:37.379
Hey.

277
00:16:37.379 --> 00:16:38.379
Hey, hey, hey.

278
00:16:38.379 --> 00:16:40.889
Derry.

279
00:16:40.889 --> 00:16:41.980
I don't know.

280
00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:42.980
Nope, nope.

281
00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:44.139
No.

282
00:16:44.139 --> 00:16:47.139
I traced the IP address of the email sender.

283
00:16:47.139 --> 00:16:48.139
And guess what?

284
00:16:48.139 --> 00:16:50.399
Came from your home.

285
00:16:50.399 --> 00:16:56.580
You spread rumors and conspired to disgrace the company's reputation.

286
00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:58.580
So I officially inform you that you're fired.

287
00:16:58.580 --> 00:16:59.580
Now please leave.

288
00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:02.580
It's a good thing you don't get to tell me that I'm fired.

289
00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:08.579
The one thing that our boss will not tolerate is his company as well as his employees being slandered.

290
00:17:08.579 --> 00:17:09.579
Well said.

291
00:17:09.579 --> 00:17:14.309
Did he hear everything I just said?

292
00:17:14.309 --> 00:17:15.309
She's right.

293
00:17:15.309 --> 00:17:27.339
Thank you so much for helping me find the evidence.

294
00:17:27.339 --> 00:17:28.339
None of you to thank me.

295
00:17:28.339 --> 00:17:31.339
The boss asked me to help you specifically.

296
00:17:31.339 --> 00:17:32.339
He did?

297
00:17:32.339 --> 00:17:35.099
He's the best.

298
00:17:35.099 --> 00:17:38.190
I think I really like him.

299
00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:41.190
You know, not like romantically or anything.

300
00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:46.319
I can even act like a guy around him if you want and treat him like we're bros.

301
00:17:46.319 --> 00:17:47.319
Lucas.

302
00:17:47.319 --> 00:17:50.319
Should we discuss the divorce details with your wife?

303
00:17:50.319 --> 00:18:10.809
Right.

304
00:18:10.809 --> 00:18:13.809
I just want to say thank you for speaking up for me.

305
00:18:13.809 --> 00:18:16.809
And if you need anything, just let me know.

306
00:18:16.809 --> 00:18:18.349
Okay.

307
00:18:18.349 --> 00:18:19.990
Of course.

308
00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:21.990
You know what actually there's something you need to do?

309
00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:24.369
What is it?

310
00:18:24.369 --> 00:18:26.369
By some basic clothes.

311
00:18:26.369 --> 00:18:29.369
Thanks, but I already have plenty of clothes.

312
00:18:29.369 --> 00:18:30.369
Not for you.

313
00:18:30.369 --> 00:18:31.619
The company.

314
00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:36.660
We're going to go on a business trip next week and I need you to represent our image in the best way possible.

315
00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:40.700
Yeah, I'll get on it.

316
00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:44.740
Good.

317
00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:59.059
It's not bad to have a boss like him.

318
00:18:59.059 --> 00:19:00.059
I can't lose this job.

319
00:19:00.059 --> 00:19:01.059
Stop.

320
00:19:01.059 --> 00:19:10.799
Stop.

321
00:19:10.799 --> 00:19:14.180
Why do you have my wife's ring?

322
00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:16.180
Lucas's wife is Michelle.

323
00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:19.339
They don't even seem like they know each other.

324
00:19:19.339 --> 00:19:21.720
That ring was given to me.

325
00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:23.720
By my lover, I haven't seen for me.

326
00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:24.720
Enough of your lies.

327
00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:25.720
I'm not lying.

328
00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:28.779
My name was Michelle.

329
00:19:28.779 --> 00:19:32.130
Then my husband left and he didn't come back.

330
00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:33.130
I changed my name.

331
00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:35.349
So he never find me.

332
00:19:35.349 --> 00:19:37.349
Is that why you're cheating on me?

333
00:19:37.349 --> 00:19:38.349
What?

334
00:19:38.349 --> 00:19:40.900
That bitch is cheating?

335
00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:41.900
I, uh...

336
00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:43.900
This is Lucas's divorce attorney.

337
00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:46.980
We need to discuss the alimony.

338
00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:48.019
Hello?

339
00:19:48.019 --> 00:19:50.240
Mrs. Herbert, are you there?

340
00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:54.799
Alright, well since you're here, let's talk divorce.

341
00:19:54.799 --> 00:19:57.089
Oh my God.

342
00:19:57.089 --> 00:19:58.089
His wife is...

343
00:19:58.089 --> 00:19:59.089
Ella?
