1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,320
Mrs. Herbert, are you there?

2
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:03,000
Yeah, yeah, I'm here.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,799
Shall we meet at the cafe in a bit?

4
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:06,120
Sure, yeah.

5
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:15,939
Who knew finding a necklace could land be such a big catch?

6
00:00:15,939 --> 00:00:17,699
She used to go by the name of Shell,

7
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:19,620
got into my company through her grandmother,

8
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,870
and now she has my wedding ring.

9
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:25,190
I can't believe that sweet, kind girl from four years ago

10
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:29,100
has become so vain and jealous.

11
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,059
I left the country after marriage.

12
00:00:31,059 --> 00:00:32,859
I've been gone for four years.

13
00:00:32,859 --> 00:00:35,659
So, boss, also left the country after a long period.

14
00:00:35,859 --> 00:00:38,740
I owe you an explanation for that.

15
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,700
So even though you fall in love with someone else,

16
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,340
I still want it made up to you.

17
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,820
How do you plan to make it up to me?

18
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:46,659
How be you?
