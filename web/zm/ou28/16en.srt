1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
My husband is paying.

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,000
Then we can wait for your husband, then.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,259
Here you go.

4
00:00:05,259 --> 00:00:08,259
If anything doesn't fit, you can come back any time to exchange.

5
00:00:08,259 --> 00:00:10,259
Thank you, Jeffrey.

6
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:13,259
Excuse me, are you serious?

7
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:15,259
She gets to leave without paying, and I don't.

8
00:00:15,259 --> 00:00:17,260
She is the owner of this store.

9
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:19,260
Why would I charge the owner?

10
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,320
Look, I'll pay.

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,339
You can just mark it under your sails.

12
00:00:25,339 --> 00:00:27,339
Oh, thank you, Mrs. Herbert.

13
00:00:27,339 --> 00:00:29,339
Mrs. Herbert?

14
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:32,340
He knows Michelle and Lucas are married.

15
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,340
I can't let Lucas come here.

16
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:46,649
You find everything you do?

17
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:48,649
Yeah, yeah, I did.

18
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:50,649
This is everything for the business trick.

19
00:00:50,649 --> 00:00:51,649
Anything you want?

20
00:00:51,649 --> 00:00:53,810
It's all yours.

21
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:55,479
Just, uh...

22
00:00:55,479 --> 00:01:03,590
Consider a pain right of force to sit.

23
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:04,590
I'm just doing my job.

24
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:10,049
I should go.

25
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:16,719
Hey, so anything she wants?

26
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:17,750
50% off.

27
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,750
Actually, do you want anything she wants?

28
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:22,420
Put her on my job.

29
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:23,420
Thank you, sir.

30
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:26,129
Your wife is a lucky woman.

31
00:01:26,129 --> 00:01:27,129
My wife?

32
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:29,129
Isn't that who we were just talking about?

33
00:01:29,129 --> 00:01:35,500
Here you are.

34
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,500
I've been looking everywhere for you.

35
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,819
What?
