1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
Please don't comment, I'm just disgusting.

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:09,740
You can't even recognize your own wife, Lucas.

3
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,740
You'll always be in my palm.

4
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:17,570
So she's trying to get close to the boss.

5
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:20,570
No wonder she was making fun of the sister.

6
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:22,570
In.

7
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:24,570
I'm sorry, madam.

8
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:25,570
We don't welcome you here.

9
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:26,570
Please leave.

10
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:30,570
No one wants to shock your gross storm anyway.

11
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:36,640
Have a good day.

12
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,640
Yeah.

13
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,640
Lucas, your wife agreed to walk out of the marriage with nothing.

14
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,640
I thought she was being reasonable.

15
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,929
It's all an act.

16
00:00:43,929 --> 00:00:48,219
Yeah.

17
00:00:48,219 --> 00:00:49,219
Get this.

18
00:00:49,219 --> 00:00:51,219
She hasn't used her credit card in four years,

19
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:53,219
and all of a sudden there's a $50,000 charge on it.

20
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,289
You know what that means?

21
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:56,289
What?

22
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:58,289
Now that we're getting divorced,

23
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:00,350
she's finally showing her true colors.

24
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:03,119
She hasn't seen it coming.

25
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:07,840
Hold on a second.
