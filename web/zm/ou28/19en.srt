1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:06,209
Michelle.

2
00:00:06,209 --> 00:00:14,609
Lucas.

3
00:00:14,609 --> 00:00:15,640
Hey, sir.

4
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,640
Sir, you dozed off.

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,440
Are you okay?

6
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:24,579
We're at the inspection site,

7
00:00:24,579 --> 00:00:26,579
but we're going to need to walk a bit to get there.

8
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:28,579
Do you think you can walk?

9
00:00:28,579 --> 00:00:29,839
It's good.

10
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:30,839
Is it enough?

11
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:33,799
What's going on with him?

12
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:43,250
Lucas!

13
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:44,250
Long time to see.

14
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,250
Yes, long time.

15
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:51,500
Our entire family is so honored to be working with you.

16
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,500
This is our best space.

17
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,500
Perfect.

18
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,500
For a new mall.

19
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,500
Allow me to show you around.

20
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,500
Bless you.

21
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,500
Are you okay?

22
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,500
Our boss is a little unlucky to get here.

23
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,719
Boss, are you okay?
