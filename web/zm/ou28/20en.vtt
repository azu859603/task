00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
Hang on, sir. The car's just outside.

2
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.290
Michelle, I need you, my wife.

3
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.289
What did you say?

4
00:00:09.289 --> 00:00:12.289
I think I'm in love with you.

5
00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:14.289
Sir, I can't hear you.

6
00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:20.539
I'm Lucas's personal doctor.

7
00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:24.539
Listen, he's very allergic to fragrances and perfumes.

8
00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.539
Give him an antihistamine first.

9
00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:28.539
Okay. Okay, hold on.

10
00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:46.649
Doctor, he's not taking it.

11
00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:47.649
He has to take it.

12
00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:50.649
That's the only way to stabilize him.
