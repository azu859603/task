1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,740
Mrs. King, you can't just...

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:04,740
There you are!

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:08,740
I'm so sorry, sir. Mrs. King insisted on seeing you now.

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:09,740
What's going on here?

5
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,740
Lucas, are you okay? I was so worried.

6
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:15,740
Mrs. King, Lucas is just recovered. He needs to rest.

7
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:18,739
I was talking to Mr. Herbert.

8
00:00:18,739 --> 00:00:20,739
Who are you to interfere with our conversation?

9
00:00:20,739 --> 00:00:24,739
Actually, my secretary can speak for me any time she wants.

10
00:00:24,739 --> 00:00:27,780
And if you have a problem with that,

11
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:29,780
well, I don't think we can work together.

12
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,579
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:35,579
I'm sorry, Lucas. I was just being silly.

14
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:41,579
Listen, I came to drop off a formal invitation to our family banquet.

15
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:47,579
I was hoping to see you there so we could properly celebrate our new partnership.

16
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:49,579
Yeah, we'll be there.

17
00:00:49,579 --> 00:00:52,579
Wonderful. I'll see you tonight then.

18
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:55,579
I look forward to being your date.

19
00:00:55,579 --> 00:00:59,399
I'm so sorry, sir.

20
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:02,399
Okay, come on.

21
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,319
All right.

22
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:08,319
Well, get ready to go to the banquet with me.

23
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:11,319
I thought Mrs. King was going to be your date.

24
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:14,319
Not really in the mood for another allergic reaction.

25
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:24,680
And Lucas's drink, and bring it to him.

26
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,640
Lucas, welcome!
