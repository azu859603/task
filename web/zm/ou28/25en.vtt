1
00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:03.870
Stop! You can't drink that.

2
00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:04.870
What?

3
00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:07.379
The doctors that you can't have me.

4
00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:08.380
So, I'm gonna take you.

5
00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:15.019
There now you can talk about this.

6
00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:18.019
Your secretary is quite the character, Lucas.

7
00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:20.019
Well, she's just doing her job.

8
00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:22.179
Second, I'm doing a problem.

9
00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:23.179
Of course not.

10
00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:30.109
Well, I think I'm feeling a little funny.

11
00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:31.109
You okay?

12
00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.109
I'm gonna go back to the room.

13
00:00:33.109 --> 00:00:34.369
Excuse us.

14
00:00:34.369 --> 00:00:35.369
I think you okay?

15
00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:39.020
Yeah.

16
00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.020
Michelle.

17
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.020
You alright?

18
00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.250
Yeah, I just...

19
00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:48.060
You hear it, don't you think?

20
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.500
Michelle, I should probably take you to the hospital.

21
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.500
I'm really glad that you're here.

22
00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:27.299
We should...

23
00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:33.079
You need to rest.

24
00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:35.079
The doctor will be here any minutes.

25
00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:37.560
The doctor?

26
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:46.579
Once a drug is out of her system, she will be fine.

27
00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:49.579
In the meantime, make sure she gets plenty of rest.

28
00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:58.680
Okay, but the kings have to pay for this.

29
00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.680
Understood.

30
00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.099
I am not.

31
00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:24.030
So she's getting a divorce too?

32
00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.939
You know what your wife did?

33
00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:29.939
She told me to come here and then just disappear.

34
00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:32.939
I've called her a million times and she still has an answer.

35
00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:34.939
I've turned down so many dates.

36
00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:36.139
What was this?

37
00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:37.139
Keep trying.

38
00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:39.139
I need this divorce finalized now.

39
00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:40.139
Please.

40
00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:49.389
Fine.

41
00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:51.389
God, I forgot about him.

42
00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:57.360
She's turned it off.

43
00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.360
Look, I don't care what you do, I just need the divorce finalized.

44
00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.360
You do this.

45
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.360
You don't even want to do this at first and now you can't wait.

46
00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.360
What happened?

47
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.360
You found another woman you love?

48
00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.360
What are you talking about?

49
00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:18.599
I'm sorry.

50
00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:21.599
So this is why you won't let me know you're assistant, huh?

51
00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:23.599
You plan on marrying her yourself?

52
00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:25.599
Are you two together?

53
00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:27.949
She doesn't know you.

54
00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:30.949
The youngest billionaire in the country has a secret crush.

55
00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:31.949
Wow.

56
00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:35.430
It's when I thought things couldn't get any weirder.

57
00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.430
Just when I thought things couldn't get any weirder.

58
00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:38.430
Okay, all right.

59
00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:39.430
That's enough now.

60
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:40.430
Let's get out of here.

61
00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:41.430
Come on.

62
00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:42.430
And look man, if you need my help, you can always come to me.

63
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:43.430
Luckily I don't.

64
00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.430
Are you going to tell her after the divorce?

65
00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.430
If you don't stop talking, I'm going to end business doing this with a family so please.

66
00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:50.430
All right, all right.

67
00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:51.430
I'll shut up.

68
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.430
Go find your ex and get this divorce done.

69
00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.430
And soon you'll be with your dream girl.

70
00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:56.430
All right.

71
00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.740
Go on.

72
00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:10.180
Thanks for helping.

73
00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.180
I should be apologizing.

74
00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.629
I failed to protect you.

75
00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:16.589
It wasn't your fault.

76
00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:19.589
And you've always been really great to me.

77
00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:21.589
You didn't know they were going to drive me.

78
00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:24.329
So you do think I'm a good boss?

79
00:04:24.329 --> 00:04:27.189
I think you're the best boss I've ever had.

80
00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:36.310
But the thing is, Michelle, I don't want to just be your boss anymore.

81
00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:37.889
Sorry.

82
00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:39.889
I'll let's get your things backed up and let's get out of here.

83
00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:44.759
Sure.

84
00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:47.860
Did the deal go through yesterday?

85
00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:48.860
More or less.

86
00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:50.050
Great.

87
00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:55.290
At least I didn't jeopardize the company.

88
00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:56.959
What?

89
00:04:56.959 --> 00:05:00.959
It says yesterday's social aid Stacey King was reported for tax evasion.

90
00:05:00.959 --> 00:05:05.959
During an attempt to escape from the police she got into a car accident and is now paralyzed

91
00:05:05.959 --> 00:05:07.959
from the waist down.

92
00:05:07.959 --> 00:05:12.959
All of her assets have been taken over by EP Group, the CEO of which is known for his ruthless

93
00:05:12.959 --> 00:05:13.959
business tactics.

94
00:05:13.959 --> 00:05:16.180
Did you do this?

95
00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.180
Would you prefer me not to?

96
00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:20.379
No.

97
00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:22.379
I mean, I think you did the right thing.

98
00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:27.500
I can't imagine what would have happened if you had drank the wine last night.

99
00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.500
It was a good thing it was me.

100
00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.879
What's wrong?

101
00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:34.329
It shouldn't have been you either.

102
00:05:34.329 --> 00:05:38.220
Do you understand that?

103
00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:42.339
You should probably answer that.

104
00:05:42.339 --> 00:05:51.990
Finally, I thought your phone was stolen.

105
00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.990
Look, I'm in Middlebury.

106
00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:53.990
Where are you?

107
00:05:53.990 --> 00:06:00.050
I'm in...

108
00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:02.050
I'm actually on my way back now.

109
00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:04.050
I can't just meet you when I get there.

110
00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.050
No, I'm not doing this again, okay?

111
00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:10.050
I'll have somebody send you the papers and just sign them and send them back immediately.

112
00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:15.269
Okay.

113
00:06:15.269 --> 00:06:17.269
Is everything okay, boss?

114
00:06:17.269 --> 00:06:18.269
Look, I'm sorry.

115
00:06:18.269 --> 00:06:22.009
I said I got a call from the divorce lawyer.

116
00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:24.389
I'm also going through divorce.

117
00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:27.389
Is there any advice or anything I can help you with?

118
00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:28.389
No.

119
00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:31.389
Actually, because I'm leaving with nothing.

120
00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:33.839
Is that what he wants?

121
00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:36.839
Well, he offered me a ceremony, but then he changed his mind.

122
00:06:36.839 --> 00:06:39.839
It's not a big deal. I just want to get this over with.

123
00:06:39.839 --> 00:06:50.819
A woman like her being married to such a lousy guy.

124
00:06:50.819 --> 00:06:51.819
What is it?

125
00:06:51.819 --> 00:06:56.379
I should wait until we're both divorced before I tell her how I feel.

126
00:06:56.379 --> 00:07:06.259
That's the respectful thing to do, right?

127
00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:09.259
These are the forms for Michelle's promotion and raise.

128
00:07:09.259 --> 00:07:13.889
Just need your signature.

129
00:07:13.889 --> 00:07:14.889
I showed Docery.

130
00:07:14.889 --> 00:07:16.889
I thought her last name was Herbert.

131
00:07:16.889 --> 00:07:20.889
Yes, she changed her name after the divorce.

132
00:07:20.889 --> 00:07:23.740
What?

133
00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:26.319
Why do you look so happy?

134
00:07:26.319 --> 00:07:27.319
Do I?

135
00:07:27.319 --> 00:07:29.319
Not anymore, but you did.

136
00:07:29.319 --> 00:07:31.800
What are you starting up?

137
00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.949
There's your board to do?

138
00:07:34.949 --> 00:07:39.759
Yep.

139
00:07:39.759 --> 00:07:41.759
Here's a divorce agreement.

140
00:07:41.759 --> 00:07:42.759
I'll sign and finalize.

141
00:07:42.759 --> 00:07:45.759
Now you can tell your little secretary how you feel.

142
00:07:45.759 --> 00:07:46.759
That was easy.

143
00:07:46.759 --> 00:07:47.759
Just like that, huh?

144
00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:59.410
By the way, you work in the same company as your ex.

145
00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:00.410
Why didn't you get her to sign yourself?

146
00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:02.410
You could have saved me a long trip.

147
00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:03.410
You used to.

148
00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:04.410
She doesn't work anymore.

149
00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:05.569
No.

150
00:08:05.569 --> 00:08:08.569
She said she has to return on a family car she got from your grandmother.

151
00:08:08.569 --> 00:08:11.569
That's why I brought you the contract before I head over there.

152
00:08:11.569 --> 00:08:12.569
Right.

153
00:08:12.569 --> 00:08:14.569
Well, she wants to do more than return than a car.

154
00:08:14.569 --> 00:08:15.569
Watch out for her.

155
00:08:15.569 --> 00:08:16.569
Well, she already signed the papers.

156
00:08:16.569 --> 00:08:17.569
There's not much she can pull off now.

157
00:08:17.569 --> 00:08:20.569
We'll be over there first and then we'll pour back to her.

158
00:08:20.569 --> 00:08:21.569
What happens?

159
00:08:21.569 --> 00:08:28.970
Got it.

160
00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:29.970
Hey, are you here?

161
00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:32.019
Yeah.

162
00:08:32.019 --> 00:08:34.019
Wait.

163
00:08:34.019 --> 00:08:35.019
You're Michelle.

164
00:08:35.019 --> 00:08:37.879
Michelle Herbert.

165
00:08:37.879 --> 00:08:39.879
You're my divorce attorney?

166
00:08:39.879 --> 00:08:48.220
You and your husband were married for four years and you had no idea what he looked like.

167
00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:52.220
My glasses were broken when we met and I couldn't see his face.

168
00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:53.220
But it doesn't matter now.

169
00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:55.220
Can you just, can you give him this?

170
00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:56.889
Wait.

171
00:08:56.889 --> 00:09:01.120
You're a guy.

172
00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:05.330
You need to meet your ex-wife.

173
00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:06.330
In person.

174
00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:07.419
Do I?

175
00:09:07.419 --> 00:09:08.419
What is that?

176
00:09:08.419 --> 00:09:17.299
Come on.

177
00:09:17.299 --> 00:09:18.299
Where is she?

178
00:09:18.299 --> 00:09:19.870
She not coming?

179
00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:21.000
There she is.

180
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000
Right there.

181
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.740
What are you talking about?

182
00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:25.740
That's Michelle, my assistant.

183
00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:26.740
I'm telling you, man.

184
00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:30.740
Michelle Herbert, now Michelle Dockery is your wife.

185
00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:31.740
You're not serious.

186
00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:32.740
Mm-hmm.

187
00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:38.399
Okay, so if I call her and it isn't, Michelle, do it, man.

188
00:09:38.399 --> 00:09:40.399
If you don't call her, I will.

189
00:09:40.399 --> 00:09:53.879
Hello?

190
00:09:53.879 --> 00:09:56.740
You really is.

191
00:09:56.740 --> 00:10:01.100
Michelle is my own wife.

192
00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:02.100
You've been married for four years.

193
00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:04.100
Didn't even know your own wife.

194
00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:05.100
Poor guy.

195
00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:06.100
Give me your memories as a kid.

196
00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:12.039
What is this problem?

197
00:10:12.039 --> 00:10:13.039
Michelle.

198
00:10:13.039 --> 00:10:14.039
Amy.

199
00:10:14.039 --> 00:10:15.200
Grandma.

200
00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:17.200
Thomas Gora.

201
00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.200
What are you guys doing here?

202
00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:20.200
Oh, cousin.

203
00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:22.200
I can't believe that scumbag left you here with nothing.

204
00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:23.200
Cousin.

205
00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:24.710
Lucas?

206
00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:26.740
Lucas, I know everything.

207
00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:28.740
Michelle never cheated on you.

208
00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:35.740
I'm so sorry for all the problems he's caused you these past few years, but he's really a good kid.

209
00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:37.740
Uh, no, it's not like that.

210
00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:39.740
I mean, he's my boss.

211
00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:44.279
Michelle, I think there's been a misunderstanding.

212
00:10:44.279 --> 00:10:50.440
This is all my fault.

213
00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:58.379
Look, I know I haven't been here the past few years, but just give me a second chance.

214
00:11:00.409 --> 00:11:03.409
Remember when you said you would never forgive someone who's done it with me?

215
00:11:03.409 --> 00:11:04.409
Ask him for forgiveness.

216
00:11:04.409 --> 00:11:07.409
Oh, Michelle, give him another chance.
