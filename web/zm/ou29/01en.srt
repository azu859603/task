1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,769
Dr. I'm so sorry, I kept you waiting.

2
00:00:06,769 --> 00:00:07,990
How's my grandmother?

3
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:09,990
I'm going to be straight with you, Claire.

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:12,990
Your grandmother doesn't have a lot of time left.

5
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:13,990
How much time?

6
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:19,859
Optimistically, a year, maybe less.

7
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:24,079
And you know the treatments that we're looking at are very expensive.

8
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:25,079
That won't be an issue.

9
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:29,079
Um, my husband, Miles, should have already paid for them.

10
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:33,380
He'll be here soon.

11
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:35,380
Okay, go there.
