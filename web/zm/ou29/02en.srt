1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,930
Are you kidding?

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:04,929
You know I fucking knew it miles.

3
00:00:04,929 --> 00:00:11,300
Claire, is that you?

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:22,829
You always were a terrible liar.

5
00:00:22,829 --> 00:00:28,809
I've always thought of you more as my mother.

6
00:00:28,809 --> 00:00:29,809
My grandmother.

7
00:00:29,809 --> 00:00:33,799
I'm not going to be here much longer.

8
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:38,140
One final wish.

9
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:42,939
I want to meet my great-grandchild before I go.

10
00:00:42,939 --> 00:00:45,939
No, I can't have a baby with my cheating husband.

11
00:00:45,939 --> 00:00:49,859
These things take time.

12
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:54,579
I want to know that you're not alone when I'm gone.

13
00:00:54,579 --> 00:00:55,740
Promise me.

14
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:57,740
Promise you'll have a baby, please.

15
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:58,740
I promise.

16
00:00:58,740 --> 00:00:59,740
Promise.
