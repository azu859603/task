1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:04,879
Claire, you can forget about this whole moving-out game that you're playing.

2
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:08,880
I know it's a bluff. Three weeks is long enough.

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,880
Come back home now.

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,900
Or...

5
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,900
It's lawyer time.

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,899
I won't tolerate this behavior for you.

7
00:00:17,899 --> 00:00:21,469
Really?

8
00:00:21,469 --> 00:00:34,060
I won't tolerate this behavior from you.

9
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,060
It's over, Miles.

10
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:37,859
Claire?

11
00:00:37,859 --> 00:00:39,859
No, Claire, we need to talk.

12
00:00:39,859 --> 00:00:41,859
You need to talk.

13
00:00:41,859 --> 00:00:44,310
To my lawyer.

14
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:45,310
Here's your number.

15
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:53,609
You are part of the historical record of my life, Miles.

16
00:00:53,609 --> 00:00:55,609
Your archaeology.

17
00:00:55,609 --> 00:00:58,280
Claire?

18
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,380
Claire!

19
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:02,380
You can't survive without me.

20
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:08,379
You have no job, and how are you going to pay your grandmother's medical bills?

21
00:01:08,379 --> 00:01:10,379
Two words, Miles.

22
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:12,379
Divorce, settlement.

23
00:01:12,379 --> 00:01:16,500
When the judge sees those pictures of you and your mistress at the bar,

24
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,500
he's going to grant me a nice fat settlement and that money's going to go straight to Dr. Andrews.

25
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,500
Claire, why are you doing this?

26
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,760
Because I don't want my kid to look like you, Miles.

27
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,760
Now fuck off, you cheating asshole!

28
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:32,980
No matter what you say, you still love me, Claire.

29
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:34,980
I know it.
