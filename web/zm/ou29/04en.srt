1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,860
But wait, let me get this straight.

2
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:09,460
You want a baby in the next year?

3
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:13,500
Yes, but you just dumped your scumbag husband.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,030
Yes, I did.

5
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:17,829
I wasn't surprised to hear that you're leaving miles

6
00:00:17,829 --> 00:00:22,620
for the scumbag, but how does that work?

7
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,920
I promised my grandma.

8
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,300
She doesn't have much time left.

9
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,380
Oh, I get it, but you're putting the cart before the horse

10
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:34,770
you don't think.

11
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:40,100
That's why I need to drink more.

12
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:43,340
This was probably my last time drinking in a bar this month.

13
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:47,299
Are you short on money?

14
00:00:47,299 --> 00:00:48,859
Miles has money.

15
00:00:48,859 --> 00:00:49,979
You're going to get a good deal.

16
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:51,140
No.

17
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:52,420
Even with the money from the divorce,

18
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,539
I can't begin to bake around this treatment.

19
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:57,810
I don't know how to get a better job now,

20
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:00,420
but I've been a housewife for seven years.

21
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:10,349
Ah, I've got some good news for you.

22
00:01:10,349 --> 00:01:12,109
You got me a massage?

23
00:01:12,109 --> 00:01:14,909
Girl, you think I would print you a hotel room

24
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:20,170
for just a massage?

25
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:22,489
Two nights, prepaid.

26
00:01:22,489 --> 00:01:24,290
Have fun.
