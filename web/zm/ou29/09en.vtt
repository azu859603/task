00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.330
She thought it was an escort.

2
00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:08.720
It's kind of hot.

3
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.619
Morning, Mr. Bridges.

4
00:00:10.619 --> 00:00:13.289
Long day ahead of us.

5
00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:14.990
Your door was open.

6
00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:22.480
Oh, that's where I left my cards.

7
00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.800
OK, stop looking at me or creeping me out.

8
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.480
What's my agenda for the day?

9
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.839
Yes, Mr. Bridges.

10
00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:31.120
Your first meeting today is at 10 a.m.

11
00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.399
With the founder of Starlight, and then at noon,

12
00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:36.200
I have been lunch with 700 minutes.

13
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.759
Claire, I'm not going to let you get away from me this time.

14
00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:58.210
He bit me?

15
00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:23.689
That's actually got a lot.

16
00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:25.709
So how was it?

17
00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:31.920
I want to hear all the details,

18
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.879
but I have to tell you something.

19
00:01:34.879 --> 00:01:37.480
Remember the alumni meet up there having tonight?

20
00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.760
Look, I'm not going.

21
00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.680
I can't see the whole college crowd.

22
00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.760
I mean, not the way that things are now.

23
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:45.640
That's why I'm calling.

24
00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.980
See, the bar that you just started working at,

25
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.700
they have party stairs.

26
00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.219
The alumni party is at your bar.

27
00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:57.060
And Gina, we'll be there.

28
00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.700
What?

29
00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.700
Shit, no, no, no, no, no, no.

30
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.260
I cannot serve drinks to the woman who stole my husband.

31
00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:05.170
I know.

32
00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.730
That's why I wanted to give you the intel.
