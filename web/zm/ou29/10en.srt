Okay, I got to go. Thank you

Hey, Tate

3
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:15,029
Yeah, so I can't work tonight. I'll take a double shift any other day. I just I can't do tonight. I gotta switch shift

4
00:00:15,029 --> 00:00:18,859
Okay, no problem. Thanks

5
00:00:19,399 --> 00:00:22,899
Are you fucking kidding me?

6
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,460
On our busiest night of the season

7
00:00:25,899 --> 00:00:32,539
You show up tonight ready to work your ass off or I will personally go online and post other employees about

You won't be able to get a job-serving dog food at the dog pound

Are we clear? You got me

00:00:41,859 --> 00:01:08,829
Can't believe my ex-wife ended up waiting tables. How embarrassing

Did you see that scar

12
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,700
Dinner and the show

13
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:36,500
