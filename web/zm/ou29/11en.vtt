1
00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.339
What the hell were you thinking?

2
00:00:02.339 --> 00:00:04.459
Let me know when you're ready to order.

3
00:00:04.459 --> 00:00:05.459
Yeah!

4
00:00:05.459 --> 00:00:08.460
All of our college friends are gonna be here.

5
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.460
You wanna embarrass yourself and me?

6
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.460
I can't humiliate you more than you've already done for yourself.

7
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.460
I mean, really my old Gina?

8
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.460
Everyone already knows that she's trashy, so what does that make you?

9
00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.170
Claire, you are my wife.

10
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.230
You're gonna come back to me whether you like it or not.

11
00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:36.880
Oh my god, is that Dominic Bridges?

12
00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.880
The Billy and Air Dominic Bridges?

13
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.880
I can't believe he's back in his days.

14
00:00:41.880 --> 00:01:20.939
That's good, brother.

15
00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.159
Dude, it's been a while.

16
00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:25.159
I figure after I've seen you on the Forbes,

17
00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:30.159
Billy and Air cover that you wouldn't want to mingle around with peasants like us.

18
00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:31.159
How you been?

19
00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:33.159
Good, good, yeah.

20
00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:35.159
I've been good.

21
00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.159
How are you?

22
00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:38.159
Oh, I'm doing really good.

23
00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.159
Running my own business.

24
00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:43.159
Nothing compared to what you're doing, of course.

25
00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:45.159
So what brought you out?

26
00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:47.769
A woman.

27
00:01:47.769 --> 00:01:49.769
Actually.

28
00:01:49.769 --> 00:01:56.829
How are you staring at my wife like that?

29
00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:07.959
How are you staring at my wife like that?

30
00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:10.340
I got you, dude.

31
00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.340
Look at your face.

32
00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.340
Oh man, half the women in town want to sleep with you.

33
00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.439
Why in the hell would you be interested in my wife?

34
00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:22.210
Oh, hold on.

35
00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:23.210
Hey.

36
00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:24.210
Hey.

37
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.270
Hello.

38
00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:26.270
Just one second.

39
00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:27.270
I'll be right back.

40
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:41.400
It's having a fun night, yeah.

41
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.490
Claire.

42
00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.550
So about last night, I want to...

43
00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:51.699
A champagne?

44
00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:54.379
Sorry, what were you saying?

45
00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:57.719
She still doesn't recognize me.

46
00:02:57.719 --> 00:02:58.719
Nothing.

47
00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:04.379
You just look different.

48
00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:13.389
Is that a good thing or a bad thing?

49
00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:16.960
Good thing.

50
00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.960
Yeah, I just, I remember you were glasses, right?

51
00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.860
Yeah.

52
00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:24.860
Yeah.

53
00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.270
Yeah, no more chunky ugly glasses.

54
00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:31.270
Thanks to contacts, you know.

55
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:33.270
I mean, cancer, I've thought of them.

56
00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.270
Actually, they popped out last night.

57
00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:38.270
It was actually such a disaster.

58
00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:44.009
I'd say your hands.

59
00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:51.330
Somebody actually can't see you without my contacts.

60
00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:52.330
She has no idea.

61
00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.330
It was me last night.

62
00:03:54.330 --> 00:04:19.100
Are you okay?

63
00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.180
Thank you.

64
00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.500
I should get back to work.

65
00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.040
No, Claire.

66
00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:32.540
You know, we should hang out.

67
00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:39.050
You mean Miles?

68
00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:44.120
Just like we did in college?

69
00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.310
Yeah, we spent a lot of time together.

70
00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.730
Things have changed, Dominic.

71
00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:54.290
I'm not your best friend's wife anymore.

72
00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:58.279
So I think you two need to hang out with me.

73
00:04:58.279 --> 00:04:59.279
It was good to see you, though.

74
00:04:59.279 --> 00:05:02.620
It was really good to see you.

75
00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:03.620
I'm gonna go.

76
00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.839
Yeah, but I don't mean to...

77
00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:06.839
Hey, dude.

78
00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:08.839
Should we call you Mr. Bridges?

79
00:05:08.839 --> 00:05:10.839
You gotta get a face bump from our old buddy.

80
00:05:10.839 --> 00:05:11.839
Well, no, Marley.

81
00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:12.839
Remember?

82
00:05:12.839 --> 00:05:14.029
Yeah.

83
00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:15.029
Yeah.

84
00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:16.029
You can see us.

85
00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:17.029
Yeah, absolutely.

86
00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:19.449
Listen, we have the best idea.

87
00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:20.449
What do you have?

88
00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:54.610
It calls and my texts.

89
00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.610
You can break a girl's heart like that.

90
00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:04.040
When you sent those pics to my wife,

91
00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.040
are you out of your goddamn mind?

92
00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.040
I was joking.

93
00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.040
But since you're free now,

94
00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:18.410
we don't have to sneak around anymore.

95
00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:20.399
I suppose?

96
00:06:20.399 --> 00:06:22.399
Are you living in a fantasy land?

97
00:06:22.399 --> 00:06:25.649
Gina, the player is my wife,

98
00:06:25.649 --> 00:06:29.569
and I'm going to get her back.

99
00:06:29.569 --> 00:06:36.420
Miles!

100
00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:51.180
Just hearing...

101
00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:53.019
What do you mean?

102
00:06:53.019 --> 00:06:54.019
Nothing's wrong.

103
00:06:54.019 --> 00:06:57.810
Except for that hag.

104
00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:59.810
Pull her down off her pedestal.

105
00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:03.060
She's so disgusting.

106
00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:04.060
If I were her,

107
00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.060
I wouldn't even show my face at this...

108
00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:08.060
Alumni meetup.

109
00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:11.339
Where's our waitress?

110
00:07:11.339 --> 00:07:19.589
We've been waiting over an hour for our cocktails.

111
00:07:19.589 --> 00:07:22.910
What kind of crappy-ass service is this?

112
00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:24.910
What kind of crappy-ass service is this?

113
00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:25.910
No.

114
00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:31.649
$1,000?

115
00:07:31.649 --> 00:07:34.829
You ruined my seven-year marriage.

116
00:07:34.829 --> 00:07:38.779
It's be realistic.

117
00:07:38.779 --> 00:07:40.779
Your husband dumped you.

118
00:07:40.779 --> 00:07:42.779
How is that supposed to be my fault?

119
00:07:42.779 --> 00:07:44.779
What the fuck, Gina?

120
00:07:44.779 --> 00:07:47.810
You haven't caused enough trouble yet to come here and make a scene?

121
00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:49.810
Poor little garbage girl.

122
00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:51.810
Is this your knight in shining armor?

123
00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:53.810
It's hilarious.

124
00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:55.810
You were nothing in college,

125
00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:57.810
and now you're less than nothing.

126
00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:01.129
Watch your dirty mouth, Gina.

127
00:08:01.129 --> 00:08:03.160
You were always jealous of Claire.

128
00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.160
You used to follow her to brat parties,

129
00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:07.160
and then open your legs for any guy.

130
00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.160
Who glanced at her?

131
00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:12.670
Yeah, I've never knew there were obsessive compulsive bitches

132
00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:14.670
until I met you.

133
00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:17.670
Didn't I kick your ass once in college gym class?

134
00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:19.670
How about a repeat performance right now?

135
00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:20.670
Hey!

136
00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:21.670
Yeah.

137
00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:22.829
No.

138
00:08:22.829 --> 00:08:23.829
You so much as touch her,

139
00:08:23.829 --> 00:08:25.829
and I will personally rip off your face

140
00:08:25.829 --> 00:08:27.829
and shove it up your surgically enhanced lunch.

141
00:08:28.829 --> 00:08:32.539
Dare you speak to me like this, waitress?

142
00:08:32.539 --> 00:08:35.539
Um, are you the manager?

143
00:08:35.539 --> 00:08:38.539
This waitress is refusing a service.

144
00:08:38.539 --> 00:08:41.659
This waitress is refusing a service.

145
00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:44.179
Now you're gonna lose your job,

146
00:08:44.179 --> 00:08:47.179
and then you'll lose your garbage house

147
00:08:47.179 --> 00:08:50.179
and already lost your husband, so what's left?

148
00:08:50.179 --> 00:08:54.399
How about you buy a pack of razor blades and end it quick?

149
00:08:54.399 --> 00:08:57.399
I'll give them to you as a gift.

150
00:08:57.399 --> 00:08:58.590
Do you want to step outside?

151
00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:00.590
What's going on here?

152
00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:02.590
Are you disrespecting a customer?

153
00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:03.590
No.

154
00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:04.590
She's not even in my section.

155
00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:06.590
They came after her.

156
00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:08.070
Stop.

157
00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:10.070
I'm assigning this table to you now, okay?

158
00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:13.070
You'll bring their order, and you'll get it right.

159
00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:14.070
Yes.

160
00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:16.070
I am so sorry, ladies.

161
00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:17.070
She's new.

162
00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:20.070
But I'll make sure she takes care of me now, okay?

163
00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:21.070
Thank you.

164
00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:36.629
Of course.

165
00:09:36.629 --> 00:09:40.659
We're going to require lots of attention now, won't we, girls?

166
00:09:40.659 --> 00:09:43.019
Bring us our cocktails.

167
00:09:43.019 --> 00:09:48.409
We don't have all night.

168
00:09:48.409 --> 00:09:50.409
Your drinks will be out right away.

169
00:09:50.409 --> 00:09:52.919
Hurry up, waitress.

170
00:09:52.919 --> 00:09:53.919
Run, waitress.

171
00:09:53.919 --> 00:10:01.840
If there were any justice in the world,

172
00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:04.840
that little bitch will choke on a chicken bone right now.

173
00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:07.980
I'll be all right.

174
00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:31.860
You know what?

175
00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:40.379
That came.

176
00:10:40.379 --> 00:10:44.330
Yeah, fine.

177
00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:45.330
She started it.

178
00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:46.330
You know what?

179
00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:48.649
Gina, for once in your life,

180
00:10:48.649 --> 00:10:50.649
can you shut your fucking mouth?

181
00:10:50.649 --> 00:10:53.480
When we were in college,

182
00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:55.480
you were wildly annoying,

183
00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:58.480
and now you're just a fucking bride of Frankenstein.

184
00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:00.480
Oh.

185
00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:01.539
Nope.

186
00:11:01.539 --> 00:11:02.799
Don't say anything.

187
00:11:02.799 --> 00:11:10.980
We didn't settle this.

188
00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:13.899
Do I look worried, Gina?

189
00:11:13.899 --> 00:11:22.019
What are your two little names?

190
00:11:22.019 --> 00:11:24.019
Julie Anderson.

191
00:11:24.019 --> 00:11:25.019
I'm Jessica Martinez.

192
00:11:25.019 --> 00:11:27.019
We saw you on the cover of that magazine.

193
00:11:27.019 --> 00:11:29.019
I actually saw it first,

194
00:11:29.019 --> 00:11:30.019
and then I showed you what I did.

195
00:11:30.019 --> 00:11:32.559
Oh, the crap.

196
00:11:32.559 --> 00:11:35.559
I saw the little games that you were trying to play with Gina.

197
00:11:35.559 --> 00:11:36.559
Oh, no, no, no.

198
00:11:36.559 --> 00:11:38.559
If you ever try to do something like that to my friends again,

199
00:11:38.559 --> 00:11:41.559
I'm going to make your life miserable.

200
00:11:41.559 --> 00:11:42.559
You got me?

201
00:11:42.559 --> 00:11:44.980
Now you two can go home as well.

202
00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:54.740
You okay?

203
00:11:54.740 --> 00:12:00.700
Thank you.

204
00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:02.700
That was very chivalrous.

205
00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:16.570
What's wrong?

206
00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:18.570
What's wrong?

207
00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:21.570
Why don't you ask your mistress, Miles?

208
00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:22.570
Hold on.

209
00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:23.570
She's not my mistress.

210
00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:25.570
It was a mistake, okay?

211
00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:27.570
But we're through now,

212
00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:29.570
but I'll make sure that she never bothers you again.

213
00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:31.570
How about you stop bothering me, Miles?

214
00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:33.570
I've worked to do things.

215
00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:42.220
You know, it's...

216
00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:44.220
It's temporary.

217
00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:46.220
She's just being dramatic.

218
00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:52.169
I'm definitely going to get her back.

219
00:12:52.169 --> 00:12:54.169
Take a clearer lesson,

220
00:12:54.169 --> 00:12:57.330
and I'll give you the rest after.

221
00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:00.960
Consider it done, ma'am.

222
00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:02.960
Thank you for giving me a ride.

223
00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:05.820
On top of everything, my car's on the shop,

224
00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:08.820
and I don't know how I'm going to pay for that.

225
00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:12.940
You know Dominic can take his eyes off you all night?

226
00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:16.500
Okay.

227
00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:18.500
Dominic is Miles's friend.

228
00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:20.500
Friends take sides and divorces,

229
00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:22.500
so I don't trust him for a second.

230
00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:26.340
I have the feeling that he's...

231
00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:28.340
Obsessed with you, Claire.

232
00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:30.500
I think he always was,

233
00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:40.570
and maybe that's the reason why he moved back to the States.

234
00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:41.570
A waitress?

235
00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:43.210
Cut a fairy tale.

236
00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:44.210
Is this made in Manhattan?

237
00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:46.210
Pearl, anything is possible.

238
00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:50.210
Okay, please promise me you won't blow off a billionaire

239
00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:56.850
for God's sake.

240
00:13:56.850 --> 00:13:59.850
Ladies, you need a ride.

241
00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:02.799
No, that's a shame.

242
00:14:02.799 --> 00:14:04.799
It does need a ride.

243
00:14:04.799 --> 00:14:09.929
If I drive her, it would just be a really big burden.

244
00:14:09.929 --> 00:14:10.929
Mm-hmm.

245
00:14:10.929 --> 00:14:11.929
You said it was fine.

246
00:14:11.929 --> 00:14:13.250
Oh, nice gentlemen.

247
00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:17.429
Please be sure to enjoy the handcrafted leather interior

248
00:14:17.429 --> 00:14:19.429
and the panoramic.

249
00:14:19.429 --> 00:14:20.820
Oh, really?

250
00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:26.519
Please.

251
00:14:26.519 --> 00:14:30.509
You know, Maggie was always a little eccentric.

252
00:14:30.509 --> 00:14:31.899
In a good way.

253
00:14:31.899 --> 00:14:36.299
I thought billionaires had drivers.

254
00:14:36.299 --> 00:14:39.350
I do?

255
00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:40.350
Yeah.

256
00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:42.509
He is in the trunk.

257
00:14:42.509 --> 00:14:47.259
Please, come with me.

258
00:14:47.259 --> 00:15:14.740
When was the last time we sat together?

259
00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:16.740
Summer, 2017.

260
00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:21.049
How do you remember that?

261
00:15:21.049 --> 00:15:24.870
I don't think that I could ever forget.

262
00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:25.870
Oh!

263
00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:28.769
Yes, because you were on the soccer team.

264
00:15:28.769 --> 00:15:30.769
And you broke your arm,

265
00:15:30.769 --> 00:15:32.769
and I felt so bad for you.

266
00:15:32.769 --> 00:15:33.769
And...

267
00:15:33.769 --> 00:16:27.159
I mean, listen, you were all fine-something.

268
00:16:27.159 --> 00:16:32.899
All of them with me being away.

269
00:16:32.899 --> 00:16:37.159
Listen, it's just...

270
00:16:37.159 --> 00:16:41.309
Wait, did Miles ask you to do this?

271
00:16:41.309 --> 00:16:45.200
Because he's embarrassed.

272
00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:48.220
That his ex-wife is working in a bar.

273
00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:50.379
Claire,

274
00:16:50.379 --> 00:16:51.379
I care about you.

275
00:16:51.379 --> 00:16:53.110
And I want...

276
00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:54.110
And you're a billionaire.

277
00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:56.100
And?

278
00:16:56.100 --> 00:17:02.070
But down on people like me.

279
00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:03.070
No, I don't.

280
00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:05.069
You're a fancy car.

281
00:17:05.069 --> 00:17:07.069
It costs more than a house.

282
00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:10.650
Well, I work my ass off for 50 bucks a day.

283
00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:15.369
He dominated bridges, and I'm nobody.

284
00:17:15.369 --> 00:17:19.289
Let's just keep it that way, okay?

285
00:17:19.289 --> 00:17:21.609
I don't want to see you again.

286
00:17:21.609 --> 00:17:28.460
Claire.

287
00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:53.880
You forgot your tip.

288
00:17:53.880 --> 00:18:03.200
You got it.

289
00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:06.619
But we did have to pay double the comp value.

290
00:18:06.619 --> 00:18:08.259
Whatever.

291
00:18:08.259 --> 00:18:10.740
Sir, if you don't mind me asking...

292
00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:13.500
What is so special about this bar?

293
00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:15.569
There's a very special woman.

294
00:18:15.569 --> 00:18:18.140
That's...

295
00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:20.259
You know what?

296
00:18:20.259 --> 00:18:22.259
Let's go this afternoon.

297
00:18:22.259 --> 00:18:23.259
Hello, James.

298
00:18:23.259 --> 00:18:31.859
Hey, it's Claire.

299
00:18:31.859 --> 00:18:34.180
Newton.

300
00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:36.589
I just...

301
00:18:36.589 --> 00:18:40.069
I wanted to say that I had a really fun time with you

302
00:18:40.069 --> 00:18:41.069
at a great time last night,

303
00:18:41.069 --> 00:18:44.230
and I know that Nagi already paid you,

304
00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:47.230
but I just wanted to give you a tip.

305
00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:51.230
Or, I mean, I'm not really sure how these things work.

306
00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:54.549
It's my first timbings in a squirt,

307
00:18:54.549 --> 00:18:57.549
or a call boy.

308
00:18:57.549 --> 00:18:58.940
I'm sorry.

309
00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:00.940
I'm a personal assistant.

310
00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:03.700
Do you have cell?

311
00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:21.950
What was that?

312
00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:23.950
I don't know if some woman calling about tipping a call boy

313
00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:25.950
seemed like a scan that you're probably about to ask me

314
00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:27.950
for my credit card number or something like that.

315
00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:29.950
Did she say her name?

316
00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:31.400
Yes.

317
00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:32.400
Um...

318
00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:36.029
Newsome?

319
00:19:36.029 --> 00:19:37.450
Newton?

320
00:19:37.450 --> 00:19:38.829
Newton?

321
00:19:38.829 --> 00:19:40.380
Yeah.

322
00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:41.380
How do you know that?

323
00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:43.950
Do you remember me?

324
00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:45.690
Hm.

325
00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:47.420
Remember's our name.

326
00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:49.799
Eight together?

327
00:19:49.799 --> 00:19:55.660
You were the call boy.

328
00:19:55.660 --> 00:19:56.660
Enough.

329
00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:58.049
For God's sake.

330
00:19:58.049 --> 00:19:59.049
Sorry.

331
00:19:59.049 --> 00:20:01.710
Sorry.

332
00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:02.710
I just...

333
00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:03.710
Didn't expect my...

334
00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:05.710
Millionaire boss to be moodlining as a call boy.

335
00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:06.710
Okay.

336
00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:08.099
Thanks.

337
00:20:08.099 --> 00:20:19.410
Don't push it.

338
00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:20.410
She was thinking of 10, I guess.

339
00:20:20.410 --> 00:20:24.390
I did an okay job then.

340
00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:26.990
Come on, let's go.

341
00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:34.460
This bar's been acquired by a rich guy,

342
00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:36.460
which means this place needs to be spotless.

343
00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:38.460
Like a mirror.

344
00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:40.940
To make a great first impression.

345
00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:42.009
Get on it.

346
00:20:42.009 --> 00:20:44.490
Tate, I just cleaned the entire place.

347
00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:46.490
I did the windows and the floors too.

348
00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:48.220
Do it better.

349
00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:50.220
Team players, Claire.

350
00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:52.220
This bar needs team players.

351
00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:54.220
Are you on the team?

352
00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:56.220
Or do you want to check today's Help Wanted section?

353
00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:58.819
Thanks, Tate.

354
00:20:58.819 --> 00:21:19.680
A thousand dollar bottle of wine has gone missing.

355
00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:20.680
What?

356
00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:23.420
The 2006 Palermo Blunt.

357
00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:24.420
You move the box.

358
00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:25.420
Where is it?

359
00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:26.420
It's right here.

360
00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:34.819
That's impossible.

361
00:21:34.819 --> 00:21:36.819
I'll give you one chance to put the bottle back there.

362
00:21:36.819 --> 00:21:39.650
You think that I did it?

363
00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:42.940
I didn't steal your damn wine bottle, Tate.

364
00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:44.420
No.

365
00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:45.420
And show me your bag.

366
00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:46.420
Gladly.

367
00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:54.869
Don't tell.

368
00:21:54.869 --> 00:21:57.019
It wasn't me.

369
00:21:57.019 --> 00:21:58.019
Yeah.

370
00:21:58.019 --> 00:21:59.339
You did.

371
00:21:59.339 --> 00:22:00.339
You're fired.

372
00:22:00.339 --> 00:22:01.660
Oh.

373
00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:02.660
Hey.

374
00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:03.660
Hey.

375
00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:05.660
What are you doing here?

376
00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:08.660
Oh, you know, I'm just getting a drink.

377
00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:09.660
Yeah.

378
00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:11.660
What are you doing here?

379
00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:14.660
Oh, you're, you're drinking at noon.

380
00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:16.140
Yeah.

381
00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:18.140
I'm just here to check on my wife.

382
00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:19.500
Cool.

383
00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:20.500
See you later.

384
00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:23.579
Okay.

385
00:22:23.579 --> 00:22:25.579
I need you to make sure that nobody knows that I'm the owner of this bar.

386
00:22:25.579 --> 00:22:26.579
Can you do that?

387
00:22:26.579 --> 00:22:31.349
No.

388
00:22:31.349 --> 00:22:32.349
I won't be railroaded like this.

389
00:22:32.349 --> 00:22:33.349
I don't know.

390
00:22:33.349 --> 00:22:34.349
No.

391
00:22:34.349 --> 00:22:35.349
Then how about I call the police?

392
00:22:35.349 --> 00:22:36.349
We'll see what they have to say about it.

393
00:22:36.349 --> 00:22:37.349
You wouldn't dare.

394
00:22:37.349 --> 00:22:38.349
Oh, try me.

395
00:22:38.349 --> 00:22:40.349
I will not be railroaded like this.

396
00:22:40.349 --> 00:22:41.349
I don't know.

397
00:22:41.349 --> 00:22:42.349
No.

398
00:22:42.349 --> 00:22:43.349
Then how about I call the police?

399
00:22:43.349 --> 00:22:44.349
We'll see what they have to say about it.

400
00:22:44.349 --> 00:22:45.349
You wouldn't dare.

401
00:22:45.349 --> 00:22:46.349
I swear to God.

402
00:22:46.349 --> 00:22:51.210
People like you will do anything for money.

403
00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:52.210
Excuse me.

404
00:22:52.210 --> 00:22:53.210
Okay.

405
00:22:53.210 --> 00:22:54.210
Who the hell are you?

406
00:22:54.210 --> 00:23:00.819
It's the new boss, idiot.

407
00:23:00.819 --> 00:23:02.819
Is this some kind of a prank?

408
00:23:02.819 --> 00:23:03.819
No.

409
00:23:03.819 --> 00:23:04.819
Hey, it's not really.

410
00:23:04.819 --> 00:23:05.819
Really?

411
00:23:05.819 --> 00:23:09.950
Because I told you to stay out of my life, Dominic.

412
00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:11.950
And now you bought the bar that I were going...

413
00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:12.950
No.

414
00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:13.950
Okay.

415
00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:14.950
Nothing to do with that.

416
00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:16.589
It's strictly business.

417
00:23:16.589 --> 00:23:17.589
Is that going to believe that?

418
00:23:17.589 --> 00:23:18.819
You're playing me.

419
00:23:18.819 --> 00:23:20.819
Dominic, both of you are.

420
00:23:20.819 --> 00:23:23.519
I'm not playing you.

421
00:23:23.519 --> 00:23:24.970
You know what?

422
00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:26.970
You want some of the weight tables at your bar?

423
00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:27.970
Have your bro do it.

424
00:23:27.970 --> 00:23:28.970
I quit.

425
00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:37.779
Well, I was calling the police.

426
00:23:37.779 --> 00:23:39.779
People like Claire learned good for nothing,

427
00:23:39.779 --> 00:23:42.779
lying, egotistical, manipulative.

428
00:23:42.779 --> 00:23:44.779
If you ever mention her name again,

429
00:23:44.779 --> 00:23:46.779
I'm going to make sure you get put in the meat locker

430
00:23:46.779 --> 00:23:48.779
and sliced up for half the hour.

431
00:23:48.779 --> 00:23:49.779
You got it?

432
00:23:49.779 --> 00:23:57.140
I apologize.

433
00:23:57.140 --> 00:23:59.140
I'll never mention Claire.

434
00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:01.259
Her name.

435
00:24:01.259 --> 00:24:05.059
Now you can see your sorry ass out.

436
00:24:05.059 --> 00:24:08.220
And never show your face around here.

437
00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:20.869
I'm sorry for my big mouth.

438
00:24:20.869 --> 00:24:26.500
You didn't want her to know that you bought the bar, right?

439
00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:27.500
No.

440
00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:28.500
I didn't.

441
00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:35.660
Is she the one that called me and tipped me?

442
00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:36.660
You?

443
00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:42.130
But she's your friend from college.

444
00:24:42.130 --> 00:24:44.799
And she's also your best friend's ex.

445
00:24:44.799 --> 00:24:45.799
Why?

446
00:24:45.799 --> 00:24:46.799
You say one more word?

447
00:24:46.799 --> 00:25:08.089
Hi, Doctor.

448
00:25:08.089 --> 00:25:13.500
Okay, I'll be right there.

449
00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:14.500
Thank you.

450
00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:15.500
Thank you so much.

451
00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:17.269
Claire.

452
00:25:17.269 --> 00:25:18.619
No.

453
00:25:18.619 --> 00:25:19.980
No.

454
00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:20.980
If you take one more step towards me,

455
00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:22.980
I will file a restraining order against you, Miles.

456
00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:23.980
What?

457
00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:24.980
I'm your husband.

458
00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:25.980
No, you were.

459
00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:35.339
You were my husband.

460
00:25:35.339 --> 00:25:36.339
How is she?

461
00:25:36.339 --> 00:25:37.339
We had a situation.

462
00:25:37.339 --> 00:25:45.220
Her vitals were dangerously low, but she's stable now.

463
00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:52.859
If this happens again, I'm not sure she can make it.

464
00:25:52.859 --> 00:25:54.759
No.

465
00:25:54.759 --> 00:25:56.759
You said one year.

466
00:25:56.759 --> 00:26:05.819
If she wants to live, if she feels that she has nothing to live for,

467
00:26:05.819 --> 00:26:06.819
it's really up to her.

468
00:26:06.819 --> 00:26:20.019
If you want to dig her mouth.

469
00:26:20.019 --> 00:26:21.019
I know she.

470
00:26:21.019 --> 00:26:22.019
From Masako.

471
00:26:22.019 --> 00:26:24.019
Oh, it's your favorite roles.

472
00:26:24.019 --> 00:26:26.089
Thank you, sweetheart.

473
00:26:26.089 --> 00:26:27.220
Maybe later.

474
00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:32.390
I haven't seen Miles in a really long time.

475
00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:34.390
Is he okay?

476
00:26:34.390 --> 00:26:36.480
Yeah.

477
00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:37.539
Yeah.

478
00:26:37.539 --> 00:26:38.539
Yeah.

479
00:26:38.539 --> 00:26:39.900
He's just busy.

480
00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:42.180
I'm sorry.

481
00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:45.180
I have to lie to you, grandma.

482
00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:50.380
I'm pregnant.

483
00:26:50.380 --> 00:27:12.369
Yeah, I'm just.

484
00:27:12.369 --> 00:27:15.750
I'm so excited to meet the baby.

485
00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:16.750
Yes.

486
00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:17.750
Everything.

487
00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:18.750
You know what?

488
00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:21.819
Maybe I will him soon after all.

489
00:27:21.819 --> 00:27:22.819
Yeah.

490
00:27:22.819 --> 00:27:23.819
Okay.

491
00:27:23.819 --> 00:27:29.490
It's just this guy.

492
00:27:29.490 --> 00:27:34.579
We're the best.

493
00:27:34.579 --> 00:27:36.940
Thank you.

494
00:27:36.940 --> 00:28:00.150
It's her.

495
00:28:00.150 --> 00:28:01.150
Ms. Newton.

496
00:28:01.150 --> 00:28:02.380
What about this speaker?

497
00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:04.819
Ms. Newton?

498
00:28:04.819 --> 00:28:14.839
I would like to see you again.

499
00:28:14.839 --> 00:28:16.769
What?

500
00:28:16.769 --> 00:28:20.039
Tonight?

501
00:28:20.039 --> 00:28:21.039
Every night.

502
00:28:21.039 --> 00:28:23.609
Every night.

503
00:28:23.609 --> 00:28:25.730
For how long?

504
00:28:25.730 --> 00:28:29.420
I'm sorry.

505
00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:32.420
You sound a little different.

506
00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:35.859
This is James Goodwin, isn't it?

507
00:28:35.859 --> 00:28:36.859
Personal assistant.

508
00:28:36.859 --> 00:28:37.859
Say that you're a personal assistant.

509
00:28:37.859 --> 00:28:45.019
I am the personal assistant to Matt Scott.

510
00:28:45.019 --> 00:28:46.559
You can speak to me.

511
00:28:46.559 --> 00:28:47.559
Matt Scott.

512
00:28:47.559 --> 00:28:49.559
That's his real name.

513
00:28:49.559 --> 00:28:52.619
Even a call boy has an assistant now.

514
00:28:52.619 --> 00:28:53.619
Interesting.

515
00:28:53.619 --> 00:28:54.619
Okay.

516
00:28:54.619 --> 00:28:55.849
Yeah.

517
00:28:55.849 --> 00:28:56.849
Hi.

518
00:28:56.849 --> 00:29:03.849
If you could tell your boss that I would like him

519
00:29:03.849 --> 00:29:15.920
to come to my house on spring streets every night until I am free.

520
00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:19.920
Of course, you know, I have nothing to do with the baby once it's born.

521
00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:21.920
And this is a completely confidential agreement.

522
00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:23.920
You know, we'll sign the paperwork.

523
00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:29.509
I'll give him two days to consider.

524
00:29:29.509 --> 00:29:32.240
Yes.

525
00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:35.670
Oh, sorry.

526
00:29:35.670 --> 00:29:37.599
Are you sure?

527
00:29:37.599 --> 00:29:39.599
You don't have to ask him first.

528
00:29:39.599 --> 00:29:40.759
Ms.

529
00:29:40.759 --> 00:29:42.759
Newton, I am Mr.

530
00:29:42.759 --> 00:29:45.759
Scott's personal assistant and his agent.

531
00:29:45.759 --> 00:29:48.019
I can make these decisions for him.

532
00:29:48.019 --> 00:29:52.940
In fact, Ms. Newton, you have made a fantastic choice.

533
00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:54.940
He has great genes.

534
00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:55.940
Top of the line DNA.

535
00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:58.940
He even has a master's degree from an Ivy League school.

536
00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:02.710
I think you'll be very impressed with his performance.

537
00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:07.099
Um, body, baby.

538
00:30:07.099 --> 00:30:10.109
All right.

539
00:30:10.109 --> 00:30:13.180
Um, there's just one condition.

540
00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:19.069
Yeah, it's just, uh, this is an exclusive agreement.

541
00:30:19.069 --> 00:30:24.460
I will leave his only client until...

542
00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:28.950
You should have gone blessed.
