1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:02,480
Are you really falling for this guy?

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:07,440
No! Maybe he's hot, he's nice, he's hot, he's smart, he's really hot.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,019
Did I mention that he's hot?

4
00:00:09,019 --> 00:00:10,859
I think he did, yeah.

5
00:00:10,859 --> 00:00:13,480
Oh, and he has a master's from an Ivy League school.

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,400
Do you believe that?

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:21,120
Come on. I actually don't care.

8
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,399
He makes me really happy.

9
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:30,559
Maggie, you know I'm on your side, no matter what.

10
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:34,740
And if you want to fall for some call boy,

11
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:38,869
all I can say is, does he have a brother?

12
00:00:38,869 --> 00:00:44,700
Shoot.

13
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,100
What? I have to go.

14
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,100
What?

15
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,100
I have a job interview.

16
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,090
Uh, I was wondering why you dressed up today.

17
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:52,090
Okay.

18
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:53,090
Go and get a girl.

19
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:54,090
I love you.

20
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,090
Love you too.

21
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:57,340
Thank you.
