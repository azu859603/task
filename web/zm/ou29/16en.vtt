00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:09.820
How long has she been waiting for?

2
00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.490
Several hours.

3
00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.489
How does a waitress think that she can even work here at a Fortune 500 company?

4
00:00:18.489 --> 00:00:24.489
She can dream, so I can crush those dreams.

5
00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:29.870
I'll never let her get an interview, but she doesn't know that.

6
00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:34.539
Does that poem install your mail?

7
00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:50.939
We're closing. You have to leave.

8
00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:54.770
Oh, no, I'm here for an interview.

9
00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.700
You know they can see you on the security cameras, right?

10
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.140
That's probably why they didn't call you in.

11
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.140
This company is for people with class.

12
00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.819
I've been waiting since two.

13
00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:13.489
It's six.

14
00:01:13.489 --> 00:01:18.409
Take a hint. That's enough.

15
00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:20.140
Bye-bye.
