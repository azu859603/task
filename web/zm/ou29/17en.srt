2
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:07,719
with you right now.

3
00:00:07,719 --> 00:00:13,839
James, I have told him many times, when I'm going to see Claire, I don't want to think

4
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:21,120
about anything else but her, okay, no distractions, all I want to think about is her.

The one that I own?

17
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:23,450
They're so unprofessional.

18
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:25,450
They said I had no class.

19
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:28,700
Like, what is that supposed to be?

20
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,700

00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:42,530
Listen, I think that you are one of the classiest women that I know.

24
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:45,620
I truly believe that.

Yeah.

26
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,140

00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,680
Okay, listen, it takes time, okay?
