00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:06.419
And if I was, would you fall in love with me?

2
00:00:06.419 --> 00:00:13.730
Oh, please, all of those rich boys are just spoiled narcissists.

3
00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:20.300
I like my call with just how you are, even if you can't get me an interview.

4
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.390
And what if I had superpowers?

5
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.149
Does that cost extra?

6
00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:31.260
I think that it would be on the house.

7
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:57.880
Dominic has the same watch.

8
00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:07.280
It must be expensive.

9
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.879
One hundred thousand dollars?

10
00:01:12.879 --> 00:01:15.969
How is that possible?

11
00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:17.409
Who is he?

12
00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:23.370
James, I want you to call the CEO of Millennial Media and tell them to dig out the resume of

13
00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.900
Claire Newton.

14
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.209
Can you do that?

15
00:01:30.209 --> 00:01:42.510
Alright, thanks.

16
00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.069
Claire Newton, this is Millennial H.R.

17
00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:47.980
We have a position for you if you're still available.

18
00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.400
Wait, seriously?

19
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.400
That's great.

20
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.000
I just, I never completed an interview.

21
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.250
A problem.

22
00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.250
We're impressed by our resume.

23
00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.659
Can you start tomorrow?

24
00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:01.659
Of course.

25
00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:03.040
Yeah.

26
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.040
Thank you.

27
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.040
Thank you so much.

28
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.960
Y'all, I'll see you tomorrow.

29
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.159
Since when was anybody impressed by a housewife's resume?
