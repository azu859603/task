00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:02.839
I am a working woman.

2
00:00:02.839 --> 00:00:10.439
I can't believe I spent half of my life as a homemaker just for a homemaker to destroy it.

3
00:00:10.439 --> 00:00:12.939
She did you a favor.

4
00:00:12.939 --> 00:00:15.939
Finally let you see the truth about D. or Miles.

5
00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:20.980
I told you years ago that he was slimed but you know nobody listens to Maggie.

6
00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:21.980
Okay.

7
00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.219
I guess that's not too late to start over.

8
00:00:26.219 --> 00:00:30.539
Well, listen to this, okay?

9
00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.570
Back in college everyone thought you were going places.

10
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.570
You were a shining star and now that that bastard is finally out of your life

11
00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.570
you're going to shine again.

12
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.570
You're going to shine so bright you're going to light up this whole city.

13
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.590
I love you.

14
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.590
Shine, shine, shine.

15
00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:52.590
Shine.

16
00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:53.590
Ooh, okay.

17
00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:55.649
We're shining.

18
00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:56.649
You're shining.

19
00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:57.649
You're shining.

20
00:00:57.649 --> 00:00:58.649
Yes.

21
00:00:58.649 --> 00:00:59.649
We're shining.

22
00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:00.649
We're drinking.

23
00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:01.649
We're drinking.
