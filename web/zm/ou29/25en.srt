1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,980
We didn't, like you and me, like two of us, together last night.

2
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:13,259
No, no, no, we didn't.

3
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:16,140
I'm saying, God, I made it happen to you.

4
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:17,620
That'd be a horrible.

5
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:22,350
Yeah.

6
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:25,260
Were you wearing that watch last night?

7
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,890
Yeah.

8
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:28,649
You kept looking at it.

9
00:00:28,649 --> 00:00:31,289
Do you have a thing for this watch?

10
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:32,369
No.

11
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:42,060
No, I just, I know someone who has a similar one.

12
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,060
Are you ready?

13
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:44,060
Yes.

14
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:45,060
Yeah.

15
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:46,060
Let's see.

16
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:53,020
Go.

17
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,020
We're here.

18
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:55,020
Thank you so much for the ride.

19
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,240
But I gotta go.

20
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,240
On Thursday.

21
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:21,849
Maybe these dumb bitches are my colleagues.

22
00:01:21,849 --> 00:01:24,209
Angelica, is it happy hour?

23
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:25,900
I don't think so.

24
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:28,030
What do you ask?

25
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:29,909
Because there's a cocktail waitress here.

26
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:32,390
Oh, the bar girl.

27
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:33,909
I heard she's going.

28
00:01:33,909 --> 00:01:38,609
I'm going home with customers.

29
00:01:38,609 --> 00:01:39,450
You're blocking my way.
