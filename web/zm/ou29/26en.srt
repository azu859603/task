1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
No, I'm blocking your way.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
You seem to be confused, Claire.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,720
This is a prestigious company for women of class,

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,160
not street trash.

5
00:00:12,439 --> 00:00:16,000
This prestigious company offered me a job.

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,760
Today's my first day.

7
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,079
You what?

8
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:22,719
If you think Millennium Media would ever hire

9
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:25,920
some trashy nobody like you, you're delusional.

10
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,839
I may be a trashy nobody, Gina,

11
00:00:28,839 --> 00:00:30,679
but you're a cheating bitch.

12
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:32,159
Call security.

13
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,280
Then set your phone to record.

14
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,640
I like a video of the guards throwing her out

15
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,640
into the gutter where she belongs.

16
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,280
See how many likes I get when I roast it.

17
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,570
Is this how you treat me when you're used to?

18
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:48,250
It sounds like a conversation I might have to have with HR.

19
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,490
What?

20
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:53,509
I just got an email.

21
00:00:53,509 --> 00:00:55,829
You're just on our team yesterday.

22
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:57,390
What the fuck?

23
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,850
She's straight from the CEO's office.

24
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:02,369
Apologize.

25
00:01:02,369 --> 00:01:04,250
Excuse me?

26
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:07,150
Apologize to me.

27
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,939
Right now, we're all good at HR.

28
00:01:09,939 --> 00:01:12,180
How dare you speak to me like this?

29
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,819
I don't know who you slept with to get this job,

30
00:01:14,819 --> 00:01:16,900
but I'm your supervisor.

31
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:20,099
That means I can either make your time here easy

32
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:22,260
or I can make your life a living hell.

33
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:25,299
Oh ladies, I see you've met the new hire.
