1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Why does Anthony like Claire so much?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,060
She just started, she's completely inexperienced,

3
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:13,589
and she's a total skank.

4
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:18,089
What if she's sleeping with him?

5
00:00:18,089 --> 00:00:22,089
Come on, how else would she snag such an amazing job without an interview?

6
00:00:22,089 --> 00:00:25,089
You must be right.

7
00:00:25,089 --> 00:00:27,089
I'm going to catch them on camera.

8
00:00:27,089 --> 00:00:40,820
See how Anthony's wife likes that.

9
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,820
The worst house on the street.

10
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:57,219
Let's wait and see who you're sleeping with.

11
00:00:57,219 --> 00:00:59,380
That's not Anthony.

12
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:04,250
Who is Claire's secret lover?

13
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:20,099
I told you, we're over.

14
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:23,060
I have some news you might want to see.

15
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:33,049
Take a look at this.

16
00:01:33,049 --> 00:01:34,049
What the fuck?

17
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:39,049
Claire was cheating on you during your marriage with this man.

18
00:01:39,049 --> 00:01:41,049
Who the fuck is this guy?

19
00:01:41,049 --> 00:01:43,049
He knows where she lives.

20
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:46,049
Would somebody invite a new boy toy to their house?

21
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:48,049
Especially one that looks like that.

22
00:01:48,049 --> 00:01:55,890
I guess Claire's not the perfect angel you thought she was.

23
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:59,939
Wait, where are you going?

24
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:02,939
I'm going to find my wife and sort this out.

25
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:03,939
Your ex?

26
00:02:03,939 --> 00:02:15,030
I haven't seen them miles lately.

27
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,539
I don't miss him.

28
00:02:17,539 --> 00:02:20,539
The two of you, okay?

29
00:02:20,539 --> 00:02:21,539
Still?

30
00:02:21,539 --> 00:02:22,599
Yeah, of course.

31
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:30,219
You're just busy, you know, with preparing for the baby.

32
00:02:31,219 --> 00:02:36,680
Hello, grandma.

33
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,189
Claire.

34
00:02:38,189 --> 00:02:41,189
Like Claire was saying, our marriage is going great.

35
00:02:41,189 --> 00:02:44,860
Yeah, we're like two little lovebirds.

36
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:45,860
Right, honey?

37
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:52,050
Right.

38
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:53,050
This line is true.

39
00:02:53,050 --> 00:03:09,759
How are you doing here?

40
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:13,759
Oh, just listening to you tell your grandmother that everything's fine between us.

41
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:15,889
You're quite the liar.

42
00:03:15,889 --> 00:03:20,080
Oh, but you're not lying about having a baby, are you?

43
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,979
I know you're having a baby with someone.

44
00:03:23,979 --> 00:03:25,009
Who is it?

45
00:03:25,009 --> 00:03:27,009
I don't know what you're talking about.

46
00:03:27,009 --> 00:03:29,009
Oh, you don't.

47
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:31,479
Who's this?

48
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:33,479
Are you spying on me?

49
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:34,479
It's called surveillance.

50
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:36,479
I'm going to get a restraining order against you.

51
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:37,479
Really?

52
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:38,479
Yeah.

53
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:45,699
You can't stop thinking of you.

54
00:03:45,699 --> 00:03:47,699
See you tonight, Matt.

55
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:49,699
So here he is.

56
00:03:49,699 --> 00:03:50,699
How long have you been seeing him?

57
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:55,650
You were sleeping with him while you were married to me.

58
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:56,650
No.

59
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:59,030
You better tell me everything, Claire.

60
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:02,030
Otherwise, this is going straight to the judge.

61
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:07,099
You can kiss goodbye to the divorce settlement you were going to use for your medical bill?

62
00:04:07,099 --> 00:04:10,099
I never so much as looked at another man, but we were married.

63
00:04:10,099 --> 00:04:13,219
What I do now is my business.

64
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:15,379
Yes, I have a lover.

65
00:04:15,379 --> 00:04:18,379
Yes, I'm having a baby sucking up miles.

66
00:04:18,379 --> 00:04:19,379
No.

67
00:04:19,379 --> 00:04:22,139
I hate you.

68
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:25,180
Matt, this is Claire's husband.

69
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:30,500
If I catch you within a thousand mile radius of my wife, you are dead.

70
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:44,459
You hear me?

71
00:04:44,459 --> 00:04:46,459
Maggie, hey, where's Clara?

72
00:04:46,459 --> 00:04:48,680
Hey.

73
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,680
She's probably visiting her grandma.

74
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,680
What's wrong?

75
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,680
Okay, which hospital is she at?

76
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,680
Let me check.

77
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,680
Looks like Miss Newton's grandmother has massive medical bills.

78
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,680
Maggie, I got to go.

79
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,509
Right.

80
00:05:02,509 --> 00:05:12,509
Boss, I have a suspicion that the reason Miss Newton is so eager to sleep with you is because her grandmother wants her to have a baby for her.

81
00:05:12,509 --> 00:05:14,509
Why did you tell me all this earlier?

82
00:05:14,509 --> 00:05:18,569
I'm sorry, I just stuck it up.

83
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:21,529
I didn't know that she was going through all this.

84
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:26,509
I want you to take care of her grandmother.

85
00:05:26,509 --> 00:05:31,540
Pay for every single medical bill and I want you to bring the best specialist to make sure that she's okay.

86
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,540
Yes, sir.

87
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:37,180
But don't tell her that I did this.

88
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:40,050
Tell her that.

89
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:44,129
Tell her that Anthony paid for her.

90
00:05:44,129 --> 00:06:02,000
Anthony paid for her.

91
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,639
Claire.

92
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:06,910
Hi.

93
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:07,910
My grandma's here.

94
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,910
Oh, I'm visiting her friend.

95
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:14,180
How was your grandmother doing?

96
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:20,410
She's gone through something.

97
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:21,410
I'm so sorry.

98
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:23,629
I hope that she gets better.

99
00:06:23,629 --> 00:06:24,629
Thank you.

100
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:28,629
Oh, I, uh, these are for your grandmother.

101
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:30,660
Really? They're not for your friend?

102
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:35,709
No, no, he doesn't.

103
00:06:35,709 --> 00:06:36,709
Thank you.

104
00:06:36,709 --> 00:06:38,709
I mean, they're beautiful.

105
00:06:38,709 --> 00:06:39,709
You're welcome.

106
00:06:39,709 --> 00:06:42,259
Sorry to interrupt Miss Newton.

107
00:06:42,259 --> 00:06:43,259
I just want you to know the bills.

108
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:45,899
Oh, oh, I, I know. I'm sorry.

109
00:06:45,899 --> 00:06:47,899
I just, I need a couple more days that I'll cover.

110
00:06:47,899 --> 00:06:48,899
No need.

111
00:06:48,899 --> 00:06:49,899
Sorry?

112
00:06:49,899 --> 00:06:52,899
I was going to tell you the bill has been paid in full.

113
00:06:52,899 --> 00:06:56,899
And Dr. Andrews is working with the best specialist in the country on Mrs. Robin's treatment.

114
00:06:56,899 --> 00:06:58,899
Wait.

115
00:06:58,899 --> 00:07:00,899
Sorry.

116
00:07:00,899 --> 00:07:02,899
The bill has been paid.

117
00:07:02,899 --> 00:07:03,899
By who?

118
00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:05,899
I believe it was a company.

119
00:07:05,899 --> 00:07:07,990
Millennium Media?

120
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:08,990
Excuse me.

121
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:13,220
I don't know.

122
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:16,540
I think, um, I think my company just paid the whole bill.

123
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:24,180
I'm going to go, uh, tell my grandma.

124
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,180
Yeah.

125
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:29,199
Yeah, uh, it was good to see you.

126
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,740
It was really nice to see you too.

127
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:42,899
Yeah.

128
00:07:42,899 --> 00:07:44,899
You do not have an appointment with Anthony.

129
00:07:44,899 --> 00:07:45,899
Go back to your office.

130
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:48,220
Claire, nice to see you.

131
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:50,220
What can I do for you?

132
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:57,579
I just wanted to thank you for, um, for making my grandmother's medical bills.

133
00:07:57,579 --> 00:07:59,740
Oh, it's not me personally.

134
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:02,740
The company has funds to sign full employees' medical expenses.

135
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:05,670
It's our pleasure.

136
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:11,519
It, um, it means a lot.

137
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:16,819
Well, I hope your grandmother feels better soon.

138
00:08:16,819 --> 00:08:18,819
In the meantime, why don't you, uh, come in.

139
00:08:18,819 --> 00:08:19,819
Have a seat.

140
00:08:19,819 --> 00:08:25,350
Tell us how we can develop our business.

141
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:56,750
Sure.

142
00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:02,570
This will teach her not to mess with me.

143
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:05,080
Who's Matt?

144
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,080
How's everything going with your Escort service, Matt?

145
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,179
Any luck making a baby yet?

146
00:09:10,179 --> 00:09:11,179
An escort?

147
00:09:11,179 --> 00:09:18,100
You're perfect.

148
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:34,899
Your ex-wife is a shameless slut.

149
00:09:34,899 --> 00:09:38,570
You know who she's been sleeping with behind your back.

150
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:40,570
An escort.

151
00:09:40,570 --> 00:10:19,460
That means...

152
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:28,940
I'm leaving love by some girl snacks.

153
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:49,299
I have a lot of things that I introduce you to, but I will see you soon.

154
00:10:49,299 --> 00:10:50,299
You dropped something.

155
00:10:50,299 --> 00:11:03,830
What the hell are you doing, Dominic?

156
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,990
You're such a coward and a liar.

157
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:07,990
You need to fix this.

158
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:14,629
You know about the board meeting, right?

159
00:11:14,629 --> 00:11:19,299
Well, I want you to prepare the presentation for me.

160
00:11:19,299 --> 00:11:21,980
You're my supervisor.

161
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:22,980
Don't you tell me.

162
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:26,139
Seriously, let's just get along now.

163
00:11:26,139 --> 00:11:28,139
It'll be easier for the both of us.

164
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:29,139
Friends?

165
00:11:29,139 --> 00:11:36,779
I can't believe this bitch actually believes me.

166
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,779
Like a lamb to the slaughter.

167
00:11:38,779 --> 00:11:42,000
This slut actually thinks I believe her.

168
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
As if.

169
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,149
Boss, this is the agenda for the Millennium Media Board meeting.

170
00:11:48,149 --> 00:11:58,980
Sir, I do not advise meeting with Miss Newton while you're there as her learning that you got her the job might upset her.

171
00:12:00,139 --> 00:12:02,139
You know, I am so tired of hiding from her.

172
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:06,149
I just think that it's time that we tell her everything.

173
00:12:06,149 --> 00:12:15,250
I do hope that she will understand, but who's my cufflink?

174
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,309
I'll look for it.

175
00:12:17,309 --> 00:12:18,309
No, you know what?

176
00:12:18,309 --> 00:12:19,309
Never mind.

177
00:12:19,309 --> 00:12:20,500
I need to get to a meeting.

178
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:32,000
Just...

179
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:55,899
Claire, I have something that I want to tell you.

180
00:12:55,899 --> 00:12:57,730
It's okay.

181
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:58,730
I understand.

182
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:19,259
I love you too.

183
00:13:19,259 --> 00:13:20,259
Where's the other one?

184
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:23,240
Claire.

185
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:33,620
Don't say anything.

186
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:48,120
It's you.

187
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,360
Matt.

188
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,570
You've been lying to me for weeks.

189
00:13:54,570 --> 00:14:06,090
Why does everyone think that I'm so stupid that I'll believe whatever bullshit they come up with?

190
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:08,090
No, I don't think that you're stupid.

191
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:09,090
Then what is this?

192
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:13,269
Is this just some college fantasy to get me in bed?

193
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,419
Is Miles in?

194
00:14:15,419 --> 00:14:16,419
No.

195
00:14:16,419 --> 00:14:17,419
Then what are you doing here?

196
00:14:17,419 --> 00:14:20,950
For the meeting.

197
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:30,090
This is your company.

198
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:32,500
Yeah.

199
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,009
You arranged for me to get a job here?

200
00:14:35,009 --> 00:14:37,289
No, it makes sense now.

201
00:14:37,289 --> 00:14:39,289
I was just trying to help.

202
00:14:39,289 --> 00:14:41,289
Stop helping me.

203
00:14:41,289 --> 00:14:46,779
Do you know how many people have helped me along the way?

204
00:14:46,779 --> 00:14:49,139
You need to learn to accept it.

205
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:53,139
The last person in the world I want a lecture from right now is you.

206
00:14:53,139 --> 00:14:57,419
And the last person I want help from right now is you.

207
00:14:57,419 --> 00:15:03,580
I'm turning in my letter of resignation after the board meeting.

208
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,580
I will be out of here tomorrow.

209
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:09,460
And Dominic.

210
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:12,580
Would I leave here?

211
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:17,460
Never want to see you again.

212
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,899
Claire.

213
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:22,049
Please.

214
00:15:22,049 --> 00:15:24,070
No.

215
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:25,389
Don't.

216
00:15:25,389 --> 00:15:26,740
Claire.

217
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:33,860
There's something wrong with Gina.

218
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:36,620
She's sick.

219
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,620
Can you help please?

220
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:41,509
Please.

221
00:15:41,509 --> 00:15:54,899
It must have been the shrimp.

222
00:15:54,899 --> 00:16:04,720
When I think I have food poisoning, I'm afraid I'm not going to be able to give the presentation.

223
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,750
Only you can do it.

224
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:07,750
No.

225
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,779
No.

226
00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:10,870
No.

227
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:11,870
I just started out the company.

228
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:12,870
I don't know anything.

229
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:15,870
You made the presentation just read it.

230
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:17,899
Well, so then why can't they do it?

231
00:16:17,899 --> 00:16:20,059
Oh, don't volunteer me.

232
00:16:20,059 --> 00:16:22,830
Don't stare at me.

233
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:27,090
Claire, this is about the management and the CEO.

234
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:29,090
Anthony's nice to you.

235
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:32,090
You don't want to shame him in front of the board.

236
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:38,080
Right.

237
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,940
I'll do it.

238
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:40,940
Use my laptop.

239
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,169
It's okay.

240
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:43,169
I've got it online.

241
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:45,169
I made changes to the presentation.

242
00:16:45,169 --> 00:16:47,169
I only saved it here.

243
00:16:47,169 --> 00:16:48,169
Use this.

244
00:16:48,169 --> 00:16:54,159
What?

245
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:55,159
Do they work here?

246
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:57,159
Oh, that was a mistake.

247
00:16:57,159 --> 00:17:00,580
I should be more careful about where I placed Claire.

248
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:02,580
Those bitches must have been making out of life hell.

249
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:04,579
Angelica, can you call CVS?

250
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:21,299
Let's move on to Gina's presentation.

251
00:17:21,299 --> 00:17:22,299
On-marketing.

252
00:17:22,299 --> 00:17:31,569
On our board members, I am Claire Newton and I've been asked to fill in Morgan's presentation

253
00:17:31,569 --> 00:17:32,569
today.

254
00:17:32,569 --> 00:17:37,009
The marketing strategy of Millennium Media.

255
00:17:37,009 --> 00:17:41,950
What the hell?

256
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:43,950
Where's all the content I made?

257
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:47,769
The bitch set me up.

258
00:17:47,769 --> 00:18:25,319
Get survey to assess online viewers' content consuming behaviors and preferences.

259
00:18:25,319 --> 00:18:28,509
I'm so excited to share with you the results.

260
00:18:28,509 --> 00:18:32,599
The behaviors and preferences of our online viewers.

261
00:18:32,599 --> 00:18:35,599
In conclusion, there was no presentation for you to give today.

262
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:38,599
However, if there were a presentation, I would thank you all for coming in.

263
00:18:38,599 --> 00:18:42,599
I'm assuming points that we've got and next quarter we've got some budget happening and

264
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:44,890
support for stuff and I would love.

265
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:45,890
Thank you.

266
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:54,859
Great job, Claire.

267
00:18:54,859 --> 00:18:59,079
Now, time to start a war.

268
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:02,079
Excuse me, everyone.

269
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:04,079
Excuse me, sorry.

270
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:07,079
I have something I need to say.

271
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:08,079
This is not on the agenda.

272
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:13,069
It's urgent and it involves Claire.

273
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:20,509
You see, according to Corporate Regulation 32.12, if an employee, such as myself, knows of any

274
00:19:20,509 --> 00:19:28,069
inappropriate conduct by a fellow employee and that inappropriate conduct could endanger

275
00:19:28,069 --> 00:19:34,069
the reputation of the company, we are required to report it.

276
00:19:34,069 --> 00:19:40,069
So, I'm sure you all understand why I have no choice but to tell you.

277
00:19:40,069 --> 00:19:43,230
You see, gentlemen, ladies.

278
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:46,230
Claire is having sex with a call boy.

279
00:19:46,230 --> 00:20:04,390
Sex with a call boy.

280
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:15,910
This Claire, right here, is having regular sexual encounters with a call boy.

281
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:21,180
Thought she pays for sex.

282
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,789
Are you out of your mind?

283
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:25,789
You're bringing my personal life into a board meeting.

284
00:20:25,789 --> 00:20:28,789
Nothing here is private.

285
00:20:28,789 --> 00:20:35,789
You see, Millennium Media is a listed company and you are on the marketing team.

286
00:20:35,789 --> 00:20:40,789
If this became public knowledge, it would cause a scandal that could rock the company and

287
00:20:40,789 --> 00:20:42,789
cause our stock prices to fall.

288
00:20:42,789 --> 00:20:47,789
What I'm saying is Claire must be terminated.

289
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:49,789
Gina, do you have any proof of this?

290
00:20:49,789 --> 00:20:50,789
Yes.

291
00:20:50,789 --> 00:20:52,789
I have absolute proof.

292
00:20:52,789 --> 00:21:05,960
Sorry to interrupt Claire's husband, or ex-husband, and she has been in a sexual relationship

293
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:10,539
with an escort, Matt, and it ruined our seven-year marriage.

294
00:21:10,539 --> 00:21:17,950
You two have put a lot of work into this show.

295
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:20,369
How dare you?

296
00:21:20,369 --> 00:21:25,369
Gina, did you spend work hours putting together this against Claire presentation because it is truly amazing.

297
00:21:25,369 --> 00:21:28,369
You're only doing my job as your supervisor.

298
00:21:28,369 --> 00:21:29,369
Claire?

299
00:21:29,369 --> 00:21:34,819
It's role-playing.

300
00:21:34,819 --> 00:21:39,819
It's role-playing.

301
00:21:39,819 --> 00:21:40,819
You heard me?

302
00:21:40,819 --> 00:21:42,420
It's role-playing.

303
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:54,390
Now, this so-called call boy escort that you speak of Matt.

304
00:21:54,390 --> 00:22:03,140
Well, I'm Matt, and Claire is my fiance.

305
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:05,369
What the fuck?

306
00:22:05,369 --> 00:22:09,369
Claire and I are both consenting adults who met in college.

307
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:16,369
Yes, we have had a completely appropriate relationship in which sometimes we have engaged

308
00:22:16,369 --> 00:22:17,369
in role-play.

309
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:24,660
Yes, it has helped spice up our relationship from time to time.

310
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:29,359
Does anybody in this room have a problem with my personal life?

311
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:35,480
Mr. Bridges, my apologies for bringing your private life into a board meeting.

312
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,480
What's wrong with you?

313
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,480
You're gonna bring an outsider into a confidential meeting?

314
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,480
Are you out of your mind?

315
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,950
I'm trying to help the company.

316
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:45,950
You're trying to help the company.

317
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:48,950
Just turn this meeting into a disaster.

318
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:49,950
Get out.

319
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:50,950
No.

320
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:51,950
Wait.

321
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:53,180
Claire?

322
00:22:53,180 --> 00:23:07,660
Why don't you tell everybody in this meeting what actually happened?

323
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:16,309
Actually happened.

324
00:23:16,309 --> 00:23:22,599
Gina told me that she had food poisoning, and she asked me to fill in for her for this presentation.

325
00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:28,049
She insisted that I use her computer to do it and deleted all of the work I had put into

326
00:23:28,049 --> 00:23:29,049
it.

327
00:23:29,049 --> 00:23:30,049
That's what happened.

328
00:23:30,049 --> 00:23:31,049
Gina, is that true?

329
00:23:31,049 --> 00:23:33,049
Anthony, she's lying.

330
00:23:33,049 --> 00:23:37,049
She just opened the Powerpoint presentation from the wrong folder.

331
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:40,049
How dare you blame that on me?

332
00:23:40,049 --> 00:23:47,049
You know, I was so nice to you, and I gave you an opportunity to speak at this board meeting,

333
00:23:47,049 --> 00:23:49,049
you dirty liar.

334
00:23:49,049 --> 00:23:52,049
My company never should have let you work here.

335
00:23:52,049 --> 00:23:53,049
Your company?

336
00:23:53,049 --> 00:23:54,500
No.

337
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:59,900
This is my company.

338
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:00,900
James?

339
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:01,900
Call security.

340
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:07,900
Gina has been harassing Claire for way too long, and I am not going to put up with any longer.

341
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:10,900
Why would I waste my time harassing this woman?

342
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,900
It's not my fault.

343
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:13,900
She's terrible at her job.

344
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,900
And what about your henchwoman, huh?

345
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:19,180
Are they going to back up your claims?

346
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:21,180
Now I have told you too.

347
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:24,599
Many times not to harass Claire.

348
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:27,599
Now you better both start telling the truth.

349
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:33,210
Or I'm going to make your life a living fucking hell.

350
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:43,680
Or I'm going to make your life a living fucking hell.

351
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,680
No.

352
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,680
Ladies, don't listen to him.

353
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,680
There was Tina.

354
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:49,740
She's been trying to get Claire fired ever since she started.

355
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:53,099
She even sabotaged Claire's interview.

356
00:24:53,099 --> 00:24:54,450
You know what?

357
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:55,450
You're fired.

358
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:59,450
I'll make sure you never work in this industry again.

359
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:00,450
Mr. Lee.

360
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:04,170
No.

361
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:05,170
You have to put bitches.

362
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,170
Or just jealous.

363
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:07,680
Come on.

364
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:12,980
He's your best friend.

365
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:18,420
Begg, please.

366
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,420
You know I didn't mean you any harm.

367
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:23,420
You meant a lot of harm, Gina.

368
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,420
And I'm never going to forgive you.

369
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,420
Security.

370
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:28,059
Oh.

371
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:29,059
No Claire.

372
00:25:29,059 --> 00:25:35,180
It's just a myth.

373
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,180
No, it's not.

374
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:40,529
Thank you for experiencing.

375
00:25:40,529 --> 00:25:42,529
Now I had told you to.

376
00:25:42,529 --> 00:25:45,529
What would happen if you made me angry again?

377
00:25:45,529 --> 00:25:46,529
You're fired.

378
00:25:46,529 --> 00:25:48,529
Both of you.

379
00:25:48,529 --> 00:25:55,529
Now I'm going to make sure that you never have another job in this city again.

380
00:25:55,529 --> 00:25:56,589
Get out.

381
00:25:56,589 --> 00:26:14,180
That was receiving a good one.

382
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:17,099
And you're your shameless bitch.

383
00:26:17,099 --> 00:26:18,099
You're sleeping with my friend?

384
00:26:18,099 --> 00:26:20,519
She's not your wife.

385
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:21,900
And I am not.

386
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:28,349
You can't punch him anywhere.

387
00:26:28,349 --> 00:26:29,480
Yes.

388
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,480
That's right.

389
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,480
I'm with him because he is hotter than you.

390
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,480
Richer than you.

391
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,480
I'm smarter than you.

392
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,480
Kinder than you.

393
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:42,710
And he has a big particular.

394
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:43,710
You stay away from her.

395
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:44,710
Hear me?

396
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:45,710
No.

397
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:50,710
You stay away from her because you treated her like shit during your marriage.

398
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:53,710
And then you kept harassing her during your divorce.

399
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:56,710
I'm going to make you fucking pay for that shit.

400
00:26:56,710 --> 00:27:02,029
James, I want you to destroy Miles's company.

401
00:27:02,029 --> 00:27:04,420
I mean you when I say it.

402
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:06,420
I'm going to fucking destroy you.

403
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:23,930
Is what you said.

404
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:25,759
True.

405
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:28,390
Which part?

406
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:33,329
And smarter.

407
00:27:33,329 --> 00:27:35,539
Kinder.

408
00:27:35,539 --> 00:27:39,420
What you said true.

409
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:47,980
The part where I'm your fiance.

410
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:53,180
Is what you said true.

411
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:57,750
The part where I'm your fiance.

412
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:59,740
Yes.

413
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:02,700
I have thought about it every day.

414
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:05,500
For seven years.

415
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:11,380
You've done so much for me.

416
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:15,039
I'm sorry I didn't see it.

417
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:19,700
Well you didn't have your contacts in.

418
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:24,170
I see you clearly now.

419
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:28,089
I want to be with you.

420
00:28:28,089 --> 00:28:32,500
And you can help me as much as you'd like.

421
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:46,690
Well if you ever have a setting urge for a cowboy, I can reprise that role for you.

422
00:28:46,690 --> 00:29:12,400
Something is wrong.

423
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,009
What?

424
00:29:14,009 --> 00:29:16,069
All of our providers cut us off.

425
00:29:16,069 --> 00:29:17,069
How is that possible?

426
00:29:17,069 --> 00:29:19,069
I just received the news.

427
00:29:19,069 --> 00:29:25,069
The worst thing is we also owe our clients $50 million since we can no longer fulfill their orders.

428
00:29:26,069 --> 00:29:29,069
They signed an exclusive contract with the Bridges group.

429
00:29:29,069 --> 00:29:34,109
Goddamn Dominic Bridges.

430
00:29:34,109 --> 00:29:36,359
Babe.

431
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:38,359
Visiting the bridal shop to check on my wedding dress.

432
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:40,900
Are you coming with me?

433
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:43,059
Babe.

434
00:29:43,059 --> 00:29:45,059
I'm visiting the bridal shop to check on my wedding dress.

435
00:29:45,059 --> 00:29:47,789
Are you coming with me?

436
00:29:47,789 --> 00:29:48,789
It's all your fault.

437
00:29:48,789 --> 00:29:50,789
You dirty bitch.

438
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:53,789
You cost me my marriage and my company.

439
00:29:53,789 --> 00:29:55,789
What are you talking about babe?

440
00:29:55,789 --> 00:29:58,789
I saved you from your shitty marriage.

441
00:29:58,789 --> 00:30:03,079
Once we tie the knot, it'll be smooth sailing.

442
00:30:03,079 --> 00:30:04,079
Smooth sailing?

443
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:06,079
Dominic fucked up my company.

444
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:07,079
What?

445
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:08,079
I'm bankrupt now.

446
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:09,079
No.

447
00:30:09,079 --> 00:30:11,079
You promised me that wedding dress.

448
00:30:11,079 --> 00:30:13,079
It's couture from Paris.

449
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:14,079
I hate to break it to you.

450
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:16,079
You don't need a wedding dress.

451
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:18,079
The wedding is off.

452
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:21,190
No.

453
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:22,349
Miles?

454
00:30:22,349 --> 00:30:25,119
You can't do this to me.

455
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:28,119
Fuck off, Gina.

456
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:30,119
I never want to see you again.

457
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:57,809
I have something to tell you.

458
00:30:57,809 --> 00:30:58,809
Okay.

459
00:30:58,809 --> 00:30:59,809
Hi.

460
00:30:59,809 --> 00:31:00,809
Hi.

461
00:31:00,809 --> 00:31:01,809
This is Robbins.

462
00:31:01,809 --> 00:31:03,970
My name is Dominic Bridges.

463
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:07,130
Is this your new husband?

464
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:08,700
Grandma.

465
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,700
Sweetheart, you can't lie to your grandmother.

466
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,700
I knew you and Miles weren't okay.

467
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:16,700
And I am so glad you dumped him.

468
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:17,700
Oh.

469
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:21,470
I'm sorry I lied to you.

470
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:23,470
Oh, I'm lost the pregnancy.

471
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:27,839
I'm sorry I lied to you.

472
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:30,839
Oh, I'm lost the pregnancy.

473
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:32,839
So you knew everything.

474
00:31:32,839 --> 00:31:34,839
Sweetheart, I had three children of my own.

475
00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:37,839
Don't you think I could tell?

476
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:39,839
I just wanted to make you happy.

477
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:40,839
All right.

478
00:31:40,839 --> 00:31:47,000
The truth is I dumped Miles.

479
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
And I'm not pregnant.

480
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
And this young man?

481
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,450
This is my boyfriend.

482
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:54,450
Boyfriend.

483
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:56,450
Aren't you going to propose to her?

484
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:59,440
You know, I've been thinking about it.

485
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:10,009
But I've been waiting for a witness to be around someone like, I don't know, a grandmother.

486
00:32:10,009 --> 00:32:11,009
Hmm.

487
00:32:11,009 --> 00:32:13,099
Maybe.

488
00:32:13,099 --> 00:32:14,259
I'm here.

489
00:32:14,259 --> 00:32:15,259
You are here.

490
00:32:15,259 --> 00:32:16,450
I am.

491
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:17,450
You know what that means?

492
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:21,730
It's a perfect time.

493
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:32,650
Claire.

494
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:34,650
Our love story is just beginning.

495
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:41,450
And I want to continue to write that story with you every single day for the rest of my life.

496
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:49,420
Will you make me the happiest man in the world and marry me?

497
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:54,650
I will.

498
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:59,599
It's the biggest diamond I ever saw.

499
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:03,299
Is he a billionaire or something?

500
00:33:03,299 --> 00:33:07,890
Oh, young man.

501
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:08,890
One more question.

502
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:11,109
Are you fertile?

503
00:33:11,109 --> 00:33:12,109
Grandma.

504
00:33:12,109 --> 00:33:15,109
Well, you need to get busy and make a baby with my granddaughter.

505
00:33:15,109 --> 00:33:16,109
I am too.

506
00:33:16,109 --> 00:33:17,109
Grandma.

507
00:33:17,109 --> 00:33:18,529
I have no time to wait.

508
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:20,069
Or a little bossy.

509
00:33:20,069 --> 00:33:25,069
Oh, you're going to have the most beautiful baby that I am absolutely short of.

510
00:33:25,069 --> 00:33:27,069
I am planning on sticking around for it.

511
00:33:27,069 --> 00:33:28,069
I'm not going anywhere.

512
00:33:28,069 --> 00:33:29,069
Yeah.

513
00:33:29,069 --> 00:33:30,069
Uh-uh.

514
00:33:30,069 --> 00:33:31,069
Not for a very, very long time.

515
00:33:31,069 --> 00:33:33,069
You just said it.

516
00:33:33,069 --> 00:33:35,390
I love you.

517
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:38,490
I'm so happy for you.
