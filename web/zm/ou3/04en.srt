00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:10,230
Do it, huh? I've arranged your marriage with Eric to help save my company.

2
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:14,230
You can't just sit around, alright? Go get the money, go get it!

3
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:31,820
Are you okay? Did you show that new candle to your hubby? Did he like it?

4
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:37,740
Yes, but Riley showed up. So, I left.

5
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:45,270
Riley is always hanging all over your husband. You're sure you're okay with that?

6
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:48,270
I'm fine, really.

7
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:57,600
It's been two years, Kat. Do you still want to keep going with this contract marriage thing?

8
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,759
It's not healthy.

9
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:05,090
If only Eric is happy.

10
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:09,430
What about you? I'm fine.

11
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:17,290
You're too nice, sort of.

12
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:28,689
Alright, enough of that. Let's go shopping.

13
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:34,689
Good, good, great. Want it? Send me your email. I'll give it to you.

14
00:01:34,689 --> 00:01:38,260
Yeah, sure. Great. Here you go.

15
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:54,579
You just can't leave us alone, can you? Now you're stalking us?
