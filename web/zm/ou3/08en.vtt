00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Ms. Sanchez, you wish to leave your 10% of the shares and all the money in the bank account to Mr. Sanchez.

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.349
Is that correct?

3
00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:12.339
Who the hell are you?

4
00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:18.339
So, you text me to come back for one, to parade another man, a stranger in front of me in my own house?

5
00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:20.339
Is that right? How long?

6
00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:22.339
Have you two been together?

7
00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:29.339
Mr. Sanchez, I am a lawyer. I represent Ms. Sanchez in your divorce case.

8
00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:44.170
Divorce? I wouldn't get the hell out of my house now.

9
00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:49.500
Why do you want this divorce so badly?

10
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.039
Our two-year contract is up.

11
00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.039
I believe I've paid off my family's debt to yours.

12
00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:05.849
I've honored the agreement with your grandmother by becoming her wife and I'm exhausted.

13
00:01:05.849 --> 00:01:07.849
I don't love you anymore.

14
00:01:07.849 --> 00:01:09.849
And I don't think you love me either.

15
00:01:09.849 --> 00:01:13.489
Please, just let me go.
