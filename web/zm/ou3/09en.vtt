1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
You promised me, forever.

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
But you don't love me.

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.650
You're the one who needs this divorce.

4
00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:17.649
You should be with Riley.

5
00:00:19.649 --> 00:00:20.649
Don't say that.

6
00:00:20.649 --> 00:00:22.649
Don't say that.

7
00:00:22.649 --> 00:00:25.649
You are my family, Catherine.

8
00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:27.649
The one and the only.

9
00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:30.679
No matter what's happened or what's to come,

10
00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:32.679
you're the only one.

11
00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:54.329
Stay here at home and wait for me.

12
00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:07.079
You have to get down to the courthouse.

13
00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:09.980
Riley is suing Andrew and Eric.

14
00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:11.980
He's furious.

15
00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:17.109
You filthy little homewriter.

16
00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:19.109
You know Eric's married.

17
00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:20.109
You're all over him.

18
00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:21.109
All of the time.

19
00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:22.109
You are shameless.

20
00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:24.109
Are you delusional?

21
00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:26.109
We met and fell in love first.

22
00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:29.109
If it weren't for that woman, he'd be married to me.

23
00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:30.109
Not her.

24
00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:34.109
Catherine and Eric have been living under the same roof for over ten years.

25
00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:35.109
And they're married.

26
00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:36.109
Don't finish.

27
00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:37.109
What is wrong with you?

28
00:01:39.239 --> 00:01:40.239
But whatever.

29
00:01:40.239 --> 00:01:43.370
Still sue your ass for a stolen you'll ride jail.

30
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.980
Who told you to?
