1
00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.720
It looks like Eric still cares about his wife.

2
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.719
Someone is going to be a third wheel forever.

3
00:00:07.719 --> 00:00:21.559
You never learn, do you?

4
00:00:21.559 --> 00:00:23.559
I told you to stay at home.

5
00:00:23.559 --> 00:00:26.620
I promise it'll never happen again.

6
00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.620
Please, don't hurt Andrew.

7
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.619
No, it's too late. He can forget about his little perfume shop.

8
00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.939
Why should I care, Catherine?

9
00:00:37.939 --> 00:01:25.000
Do you remember the promise?

10
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.700
You lost everything. Everything, Catherine. I'm all alone.

11
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:43.159
I will always be there for you, Eric.

12
00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:49.650
You will never be alone. You have me always.

13
00:01:49.650 --> 00:02:20.060
I still have you.

14
00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.909
This is my promise to you. Don't ever lose it.

15
00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:29.780
Don't worry.

16
00:02:29.780 --> 00:03:07.680
You understand me?

17
00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:16.020
It feels like it's been forever since we were this close.

18
00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.699
Look, we used to be, isn't it?

19
00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:35.689
Do you see me as your woman still?

20
00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:44.439
Hello. She's sick.

21
00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:49.800
Okay, fine. I'll have a driver take you to the hospital.

22
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:59.129
I'm fine. Go.

23
00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:01.960
You want me to leave?

24
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.409
Eric, I will try my best to make up for what my brother's done to you.

25
00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:13.050
I'll be right there.

26
00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:25.259
You deserve to be happy.

27
00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:26.259
Take this.

28
00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:30.480
Use it to pay Riley's medical bills and fines from her lawsuit.

29
00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:37.550
The shop is doing really well. I can manage.

30
00:04:37.550 --> 00:05:17.370
Catherine?

31
00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.370
Oh my god, Catherine, you have a fever.

32
00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:29.209
Hey, you're awake.

33
00:05:29.209 --> 00:05:33.740
Listen honey, you passed out from your fever.

34
00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:39.699
I freaked out that luckily my brother came over and brought you to the hospital.

35
00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:50.589
Doctor.

36
00:05:50.589 --> 00:05:51.589
Is she all right?

37
00:05:51.589 --> 00:05:55.709
Ms. Sanchez has a common cold.

38
00:05:55.709 --> 00:06:00.350
Although our temperature is quite high, it's nothing too serious.

39
00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:04.279
However, she's too much pregnant.

40
00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:08.620
We need to be careful of our medications moving forward.

41
00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:09.660
What?

42
00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:13.350
Catherine, you're pregnant?

43
00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:14.350
Are you sure?

44
00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:18.579
Positive.

45
00:06:18.579 --> 00:06:22.579
During your pregnancy, you need to avoid alcohol,

46
00:06:22.579 --> 00:06:29.209
tobacco, caffeine, the works, okay?

47
00:06:29.209 --> 00:06:30.209
Should I call Eric?

48
00:06:30.209 --> 00:06:40.100
You wouldn't want this child. Not with me, at least.

49
00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:43.160
Yeah, but what about you? What do you want?

50
00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:53.939
I've always wanted a child. My baby, this baby means everything to me.

51
00:06:53.939 --> 00:07:01.050
Okay, and I'm all in. We will race this baby together.

52
00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:05.899
Please, don't tell anyone.

53
00:07:05.899 --> 00:07:16.439
We'll tell anyone.

54
00:07:16.439 --> 00:07:19.439
This time, Mommy won't let anything happen to you.

55
00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:38.569
Go get the money. Go get it.

56
00:07:38.569 --> 00:07:39.569
Divorce papers?

57
00:07:39.569 --> 00:08:05.259
Your brother. This whole marriage.

58
00:08:05.259 --> 00:08:07.060
It's all right.

59
00:08:07.060 --> 00:09:20.539
Consider it your guest here.

60
00:09:20.539 --> 00:09:44.909
Wait. Do you know?

61
00:09:44.909 --> 00:09:47.909
You can't control me forever.

62
00:09:47.909 --> 00:09:58.820
You treat me like you're property anymore. I'm done.

63
00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:01.559
You don't like this sign anymore?

64
00:10:01.559 --> 00:10:07.379
No, I don't like these anymore.

65
00:10:07.379 --> 00:10:09.730
It doesn't matter.

66
00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:12.779
You promised me forever.

67
00:10:15.779 --> 00:10:18.009
I'm not letting go.

68
00:10:25.080 --> 00:11:06.110
Wightly?

69
00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:33.429
Remember the photo that speed photographer took of us?

70
00:11:33.429 --> 00:11:36.429
Made it into a magazine.

71
00:11:36.429 --> 00:11:39.429
They want you to be the new face of their new makeup line.

72
00:11:39.429 --> 00:12:04.059
I need you to figure out what's going on with Katherine and your magazine.

73
00:12:04.059 --> 00:12:07.059
Kat, the magazine wants to pay you serious money.

74
00:12:07.059 --> 00:12:22.059
You can save up for the baby.

75
00:12:22.059 --> 00:12:24.059
He's not actually asking you out.

76
00:12:24.059 --> 00:12:25.059
Okay, it's just a prank.

77
00:12:25.059 --> 00:12:26.059
And wipe all that off.

78
00:12:26.059 --> 00:12:28.120
You look like a joke with makeup on.

79
00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:30.120
If you go, don't even bother coming home.

80
00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:37.080
Do you really think I'm a joke?

81
00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:42.919
Oh my god, I'm so excited.

82
00:12:42.919 --> 00:12:45.919
I love all of these products, especially this one.

83
00:12:45.919 --> 00:12:48.340
This is one of my favorite new one.

84
00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:56.909
I know everybody is absolutely stunning.

85
00:12:56.909 --> 00:12:59.039
Just be yourself, okay?

86
00:12:59.039 --> 00:13:00.039
No need to be nervous.

87
00:13:00.039 --> 00:13:04.700
I want your latest products.

88
00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:07.860
And I want your head makeup artist to do my makeup.

89
00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:15.990
Now.

90
00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:20.419
For sure.

91
00:13:20.419 --> 00:13:24.019
So, this is the new face of the new line?

92
00:13:24.019 --> 00:13:25.019
Yes, Riley.

93
00:13:25.019 --> 00:13:30.019
We also have products that are just perfect for you to present.

94
00:13:30.019 --> 00:13:34.019
Take a look at this, elegant, refined, totally your style.

95
00:13:34.019 --> 00:13:35.019
No.

96
00:13:35.019 --> 00:13:36.019
I don't like it.

97
00:13:36.019 --> 00:13:38.570
I want the one.

98
00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:39.789
She's presenting.

99
00:13:39.789 --> 00:13:43.080
Lily, what's going on?

100
00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:46.429
This is our big customer, slash influencer.

101
00:13:46.429 --> 00:13:49.429
I'll say, I'll just go.

102
00:13:49.429 --> 00:13:50.429
Oh.

103
00:13:50.429 --> 00:13:52.879
She's the girlfriend.

104
00:13:52.879 --> 00:13:55.879
And what about Miss Sanchez?

105
00:13:55.879 --> 00:13:57.970
His wife.

106
00:13:57.970 --> 00:13:58.970
What?

107
00:13:58.970 --> 00:14:00.159
About her.

108
00:14:00.159 --> 00:14:01.159
Isn't it obvious?

109
00:14:01.159 --> 00:14:06.480
You're just a gold digger trying to wreck this marriage to get Eric's money.

110
00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:07.480
Face it, honey.

111
00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:12.169
You will never measure up.

112
00:14:12.169 --> 00:14:13.169
Let's just go.

113
00:14:13.169 --> 00:14:14.519
Why?

114
00:14:14.519 --> 00:14:16.519
You are not the one to leave.

115
00:14:16.519 --> 00:14:17.519
I had a suggestion.

116
00:14:17.519 --> 00:14:21.519
Why don't we let our head makeup artist work or go for you,

117
00:14:21.519 --> 00:14:23.519
using the same product?

118
00:14:23.519 --> 00:14:27.519
That way we can see most compatible with a new line.

119
00:14:27.519 --> 00:14:28.549
Yeah?

120
00:14:28.549 --> 00:14:29.549
Okay.

121
00:14:29.549 --> 00:14:30.549
Let's do it.

122
00:14:30.549 --> 00:14:33.549
This one doesn't stand a chance anyways.

123
00:14:33.549 --> 00:14:42.690
Catherine was born for this.

124
00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:45.690
This is our head makeup artist, Kenneth.

125
00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:47.850
Who wants to go first?

126
00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:48.850
I'll go first.

127
00:14:48.850 --> 00:15:06.980
I don't want to use something someone else's use.

128
00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:07.980
Perfection.

129
00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:09.980
Just perfection.

130
00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:11.980
You were born for this book.

131
00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:25.090
I am sorry Miss Riley, but Catherine will be the face of our mother.

132
00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:26.090
How can I help you?

133
00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:27.090
I've told you before.

134
00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:29.149
I don't want you wearing any makeup.

135
00:15:29.149 --> 00:15:31.879
Are you serious?

136
00:15:31.879 --> 00:15:34.509
White bit.

137
00:15:35.509 --> 00:15:52.059
It's the start.

138
00:15:52.059 --> 00:15:53.610
Is that he?

139
00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:54.610
It's the start.

140
00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:56.610
I need you to do what?

141
00:15:56.610 --> 00:15:57.769
I'm going to do something.

142
00:15:57.769 --> 00:15:58.769
I'm going to do something.

143
00:15:58.769 --> 00:16:03.200
Andrew, I can't drag you into this mess.

144
00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:05.200
You're my only friend.

145
00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:11.070
I'm acquiring your magazine too.

146
00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:13.070
Range everything to Riley's specification.

147
00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:14.549
Why?

148
00:16:14.549 --> 00:16:15.549
Why?

149
00:16:15.549 --> 00:16:16.549
Hello.

150
00:16:16.549 --> 00:16:17.549
It's course.

151
00:16:17.549 --> 00:16:18.779
Thank you.

152
00:16:18.779 --> 00:16:20.779
And I knew you left when you are.

153
00:16:20.779 --> 00:16:22.899
Who's the home dragon man?

154
00:16:22.899 --> 00:16:35.019
I told you not to see him.

155
00:16:35.019 --> 00:16:37.019
Why don't you ever listen to me?

156
00:16:37.019 --> 00:16:40.750
I just want to make my own money.

157
00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:42.750
Didn't I give you an unlimited credit card?

158
00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:45.549
We need money for anyone.

159
00:16:45.549 --> 00:16:48.419
I just want to start fresh.

160
00:16:48.419 --> 00:16:53.149
Our marriage was just your grandma's wish and my brother's lies.

161
00:16:53.149 --> 00:16:56.149
We don't love each other so stop pretending.

162
00:16:56.149 --> 00:16:58.909
Catherine?

163
00:17:00.649 --> 00:17:01.649
I don't want to continue.

164
00:17:01.649 --> 00:17:03.940
I want a normal relationship.

165
00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:05.190
It's who?

166
00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:08.779
But you.

167
00:17:08.779 --> 00:17:13.119
Get out of the car.

168
00:17:13.119 --> 00:17:14.500
People walk through us.

169
00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:15.500
But it's mother's dinner.

170
00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:16.500
You better not.

171
00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:44.039
I need you to find Catherine's location.

172
00:17:44.039 --> 00:18:15.980
If you don't love me, why do you keep giving me hope?

173
00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:23.970
You can't even have a simple meal without an interruption.

174
00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:26.970
Why is she always such a bummer?

175
00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:30.000
The company anniversary is coming up.

176
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:36.000
Catherine, with your condition, better not to embarrass yourself by showing up.

177
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000
Just stay.

178
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.140
Riley will be your date for this event.

179
00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:58.329
Why do you really want this device so bad?

180
00:18:58.329 --> 00:18:59.519
What's the real reason?

181
00:18:59.519 --> 00:19:08.920
You can buy the entire magazine for Riley.

182
00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:13.940
Yet you didn't care that it would ruin my chance to be the face of the makeup line.

183
00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:21.130
I'm not the one you love.

184
00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:24.579
So, why not just let us both move on?

185
00:19:24.579 --> 00:19:29.660
You're jealous of Riley.

186
00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:31.660
Why don't we go on a date tomorrow?

187
00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:32.819
Hmm?

188
00:19:32.819 --> 00:20:44.279
I'll take you to my office, Mom.

189
00:20:44.279 --> 00:20:45.279
It's for that new girl.

190
00:20:45.279 --> 00:20:47.819
It's her birthday.

191
00:20:47.819 --> 00:20:49.920
And you actually got her something.

192
00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:50.950
I need to run.

193
00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:51.950
Excuse me.

194
00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:57.660
I don't know.

195
00:20:57.660 --> 00:20:59.660
I can't stand the idea of you actually being there.

196
00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:00.819
Don't go anywhere.

197
00:21:00.819 --> 00:21:01.819
No.

198
00:21:01.819 --> 00:21:03.259
I don't care.

199
00:21:03.259 --> 00:21:07.269
Do you love me?

200
00:21:07.269 --> 00:21:17.900
Let's have.

201
00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:19.059
After everything I don't feel.

202
00:21:19.059 --> 00:21:20.059
Doesn't any of that matter?

203
00:21:20.059 --> 00:21:22.059
The whole world knows you might know.

204
00:21:22.059 --> 00:21:25.799
Then why after all these years have you never even touched me?

205
00:21:25.799 --> 00:21:26.799
You know why.

206
00:21:26.799 --> 00:21:27.900
I can't marry.

207
00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:30.819
Do you even like me?

208
00:21:30.819 --> 00:21:35.019
Why?

209
00:21:35.019 --> 00:21:42.099
Because of you too.

210
00:21:42.099 --> 00:21:46.319
You don't want her back there.

211
00:21:46.319 --> 00:22:29.460
You are my-

212
00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:40.650
That'd be a birthday to me.

213
00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:55.819
What are you doing?

214
00:22:55.819 --> 00:23:02.579
Eric, what am I to you?

215
00:23:02.579 --> 00:23:04.710
A toy I heard is smart.

216
00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:05.710
What did you say?

217
00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:06.710
Say that again.

218
00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:09.930
Am I just a toy to you?

219
00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:11.660
That was wrong.

220
00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:17.769
Why would you talk about yourself like that?

221
00:23:17.769 --> 00:23:18.769
Why?

222
00:23:18.769 --> 00:23:21.380
I'm just a joke to everyone else.

223
00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:24.789
I should never have let you hang out with Andrew and his friends.

224
00:23:24.789 --> 00:23:27.789
You're becoming more impeded every day.

225
00:23:27.789 --> 00:23:31.069
It has nothing to do with them.

226
00:23:31.069 --> 00:23:33.940
They respect me.

227
00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:35.940
This is all Andrew's doing.

228
00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:40.940
Without him putting ideas in your head, you wouldn't be acting like this.

229
00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:43.190
I barely recognize you.

230
00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:47.779
You're the one that's changed.

231
00:23:47.779 --> 00:23:52.309
You think I'm just going to let you act like this?

232
00:23:52.309 --> 00:23:53.309
Like a smart ass?

233
00:23:53.309 --> 00:23:56.309
I don't want you leaving this house for the next two weeks.

234
00:23:56.309 --> 00:23:59.309
And he can say goodbye to his pathetic little purview shop.

235
00:24:00.309 --> 00:24:39.779
Can you please take me to Cat's house?

236
00:24:39.779 --> 00:24:40.779
She's not answering my calls.

237
00:24:40.779 --> 00:24:43.299
I'm really worried about her.

238
00:24:43.299 --> 00:24:44.299
She's Eric's wife.

239
00:24:44.299 --> 00:24:45.299
Okay.

240
00:24:45.299 --> 00:24:46.299
This is not your problem.

241
00:24:46.299 --> 00:24:48.299
Please, she's pregnant and it's her birthday.

242
00:24:48.299 --> 00:24:59.700
She never misses my calls on her birthday.

243
00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:03.700
Possibly be happening in her house in the middle of the night.

244
00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:04.700
Something's wrong.

245
00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:05.700
My gut's never off.

246
00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:08.180
All right, we can't get caught.

247
00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:09.180
Okay.

248
00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:10.180
Okay.

249
00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:26.380
The door, okay?

250
00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:27.380
Don't move away from the door.

251
00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:37.730
Get the car.

252
00:25:37.730 --> 00:26:00.710
Go.

253
00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:02.349
Pregnancy could be tough.

254
00:26:02.349 --> 00:26:05.670
Right now, she really needs to rest.

255
00:26:05.670 --> 00:26:07.670
Too much stress or strenuous activity.

256
00:26:07.670 --> 00:26:10.670
It could lead to danger to the baby.

257
00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:13.930
We can't afford another incident like this morning.

258
00:26:13.930 --> 00:26:17.400
How are you feeling?

259
00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:21.420
How can you treat you like that, especially now that you're pregnant?

260
00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:24.380
You need to leave him.

261
00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:26.380
You need to leave that house.

262
00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:30.089
I won't drag you two into this mess.

263
00:26:30.089 --> 00:26:35.170
I want to go home.

264
00:26:35.170 --> 00:26:37.170
Please bring me back.

265
00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:38.170
Thank you.

266
00:26:38.170 --> 00:26:40.170
What are you talking about?

267
00:26:40.170 --> 00:26:43.170
This is a matter of life and death.

268
00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:47.839
You might not care about your own life, but what about the baby?

269
00:26:47.839 --> 00:26:52.430
He needs to stay with us.

270
00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:53.460
He needs.

271
00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:55.460
He needs to rest.

272
00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:59.190
You're coming with us.

273
00:26:59.190 --> 00:27:01.190
Figure out a way to deal with her.

274
00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:08.019
Catherine! Catherine!

275
00:27:08.019 --> 00:27:16.900
Do you know what Catherine is?

276
00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:17.900
She's at William's house, sir.

277
00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:45.059
Getting cozy with angels, man.

278
00:27:45.059 --> 00:27:49.059
Andrew Budd, the second son of the Budd family, was involved in street racing,

279
00:27:49.059 --> 00:27:52.059
resulting in three injuries, with one person still in a coma.

280
00:27:52.059 --> 00:27:55.059
He has since been taken into police custody.

281
00:27:55.059 --> 00:28:13.470
Should we call off the acquisition?

282
00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:14.470
No.

283
00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:15.630
Continue his plan.

284
00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:19.900
Earth, that Andrew guy killed someone.

285
00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:21.900
Was that your doing?

286
00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:22.900
What do you think?

287
00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:23.900
Oh!

288
00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:24.900
You're the best.

289
00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:29.900
You spent annoying me non-stop, and you got rid of him for me.

290
00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:34.369
Catherine.

291
00:28:34.369 --> 00:28:36.369
What are you doing here?

292
00:28:36.369 --> 00:28:38.299
Why?

293
00:28:38.299 --> 00:28:39.420
Why?

294
00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:43.130
If you're here about Andrew, you can forget about it.

295
00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:45.130
You need to leave.

296
00:28:45.130 --> 00:28:46.130
No.

297
00:28:46.130 --> 00:28:48.759
No.

298
00:28:48.759 --> 00:28:51.049
I mean you.
