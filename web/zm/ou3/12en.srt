1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,280
No. I'm not going anywhere.

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,279
I'm not going to repeat myself.

3
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:20,440
You promised me to leave Andrew alone.

4
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:26,510
And you promised me you wouldn't see him again.

5
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:34,060
Now, not just Andrew, but the whole but family will pay for his mistakes.

6
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,210
Please, just stop.

7
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:42,950
I'll come back with you.

8
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:46,299
And I'll never have to see him again.

9
00:00:46,299 --> 00:00:48,890
I'll listen to you.

10
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:53,670
Do whatever you want, but please, bear him.

11
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:54,670
Please.

12
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:58,780
Now you're begging me.

13
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:02,770
How do I know you mean it?

14
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:11,420
Go home away from me.

15
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:32,900
Got it.

16
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:33,900
What did Eric say to you?

17
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:34,900
I warned you.

18
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,900
Stay away from my boyfriend.

19
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:43,090
That's my husband you're talking about.

20
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:45,090
Does he treat you like a husband?

21
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:47,090
He was forced into this marriage.

22
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:49,090
People like you bring troubles with those around him.

23
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:54,340
I mean, Andrew's already in jail because of you.
