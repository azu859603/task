1
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:07,049
You've caused quite a mess, haven't you?

2
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:11,050
We took you in, we raised you, and this is how you thank us?

3
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:12,050
What's next?

4
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:16,899
Are you gonna give me a new successor?

5
00:00:16,899 --> 00:00:18,899
The doctor said it's not genetic.

6
00:00:18,899 --> 00:00:24,370
There's a good chance the baby will be healthy.

7
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:27,370
There's always a chance, but we can't take that risk.

8
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:32,369
The sooner you and Eric divorce, the better it will be for both of you.

9
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:36,039
Who said I'm getting a divorce?

10
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:40,070
You know, mother, you really should keep me in the loop on this sort of thing.

11
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:42,070
I mean, after all, it's not like Catherine.

12
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:47,420
We were just chatting. Nothing to worry about.

13
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:49,420
Oh, why would there be anything to worry about?

14
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:53,460
Well, we're all here.

15
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,460
Let's eat, shall we?

16
00:00:55,460 --> 00:01:22,420
Catherine, I heard from security that you went to the hospital.

17
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:24,420
My stomach was feeling a bit off.

18
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,450
Are you okay? Why didn't you tell me about this?

19
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:35,370
I know you're busy with work. I didn't want to bother you. It wasn't a big deal.

20
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:40,040
If it's not better by tomorrow, let me know. I'll thank you straight to the hospital.

21
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,939
Catherine, are you sure this is just a stomach issue?

22
00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:45,939
What if you're pregnant?

23
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:49,060
No, it's not.

24
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:56,590
Well, that's a relief.

25
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,590
Pregnancy would be troublesome to deal with.

26
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:05,299
Nobody wants this baby.

27
00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:09,300
I will protect you, and no one will know about you.
