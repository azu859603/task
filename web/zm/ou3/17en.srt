1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,040
Are you sure you're not pregnant?

2
00:00:08,779 --> 00:00:10,990
No

3
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:14,310
You know, I've been taking pills to not get pregnant

4
00:00:14,869 --> 00:00:18,410
They're very effective

5
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:21,699
You better not be lying to me. You understand?

6
00:00:22,339 --> 00:00:40,170
All right, I'm spreading a sex or size. No sexual activity

7
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:45,649
If there's anything heavy bleeding again, that could lead to a miscarriage. I

8
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:51,149
Want to stay here for a few days

9
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:57,920
Why the change of scenery might be nice, you know

10
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:02,179
It's more lively here with so many people

11
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:10,590
If anything comes up, you call me right away. All right. I'll be back to pick you up in a few days

12
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:22,180
Eric waiting for someone is too painful. I don't want to wait anymore

13
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:29,980
You can partner for over 20 years

14
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:36,599
You and your brother are crazy. I appreciate you meeting lawyers for Andrew. I do

15
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,760
Even though we're struggling right now

16
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:44,319
We don't need Catherine bending over backwards for us anymore. We've been good to her

17
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:52,900
Mostly because we've seen what she's gone through with you and how you treated her. You are the crazy one. Not her

18
00:01:53,260 --> 00:02:01,379
Is it true? Is it true what they're saying?

19
00:02:01,819 --> 00:02:07,010
Just tell me did you set up Andrew's accent to get back in her eye on?

20
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:15,580
What do you think? But first I never would have believed it was you

21
00:02:15,939 --> 00:02:23,879
But no, I guess it doesn't matter anymore does
