1
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:08,150
Is that true? Did you marry me just for the sake of your grandmother?

2
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:10,279
That's not for you to worry about.

3
00:00:10,279 --> 00:00:15,230
You never really loved me, did you?

4
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:22,570
Catherine, can you just drop this? Why do you listen to what other people say?

5
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:25,570
What Andrew and William say?

6
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:29,600
You and I are happy together, aren't we? At least sometimes.

7
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:41,939
Eric, what am I to you? Answer me for real this time. Please.

8
00:00:41,939 --> 00:00:47,189
You are very special to me. We'll always be together, just like we always have been.

9
00:00:47,189 --> 00:00:53,189
No, I'm not. And no, we're not. Let me go, please.

10
00:00:53,189 --> 00:00:58,189
After all these years, after everything that I've done for you, you're this unhappy with me.

11
00:00:58,189 --> 00:01:13,099
I want a divorce. Please, I am so tired. Let me go.

12
00:01:13,099 --> 00:01:27,519
You. I see.

13
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:32,519
After all these years of letting you live with my family, you still pick him over me.
