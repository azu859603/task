1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:07,139
We're done. I don't love you anymore. Let me go.

2
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:12,140
Fine, fine. I'll have my lawyers draw up the paperwork then.

3
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:24,510
I can't wait to see her survive without you.

4
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:26,510
I heard you're finally getting a divorce.

5
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:30,469
Who told you I'm getting a divorce?

6
00:00:30,469 --> 00:00:35,100
I just know.

7
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,840
Riley, you get along well with my mother, don't you?

8
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:47,939
Everyone knows I'm your girlfriend, so I have to get along with your mother, right?

9
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:50,329
Every.

10
00:00:50,329 --> 00:00:53,329
Yeah. You said so.

11
00:00:53,329 --> 00:00:56,520
Well, you can tell everyone you are no longer.

12
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,520
I'll get the hell out of my office I've worked in.

13
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:18,540
You will be.

14
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,540
Very soon.
