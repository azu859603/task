00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:18.010
From this day forward, I'm holding 30% of the company's shares making me the largest shareholder, and I am the major shareholder, giving me majority control over the company.

2
00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:23.780
Actually, the largest shareholder is me, 45%.

3
00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.780
What? How can that even be possible?

4
00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.780
This here is grandmother's secret whip.

5
00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:39.780
After being married for two years, I'm now eligible for 20% of her nominal shares, plus the 25% I already own with my wife, Kat.

6
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.780
20 plus 25 equals 45, right?

7
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.189
I mean, I surely couldn't have done such a simple math problem.

8
00:00:50.189 --> 00:00:54.219
I don't believe you let me see that.

9
00:00:54.219 --> 00:01:03.869
Ma'am, he's absolutely right.

10
00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:06.870
You've been trying to control me my entire life.

11
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:12.859
Mother, you dress it up as family, but let's be real. You don't value me.

12
00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:16.859
To me, to you, all I've ever been is a normal.

13
00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:19.989
A calculation of how much my shares are worth.

14
00:01:19.989 --> 00:01:22.250
That is not true. I loved you as a son.

15
00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:30.250
No, you didn't. I grew up watching you and father tear each other apart from control or power or money.

16
00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:38.340
Catherine, the neighbor's girl, a mute girl who was younger than me, looked after me more than you ever.

17
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.439
Eric, stop this nonsense.

18
00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:49.439
No, I won't because it's true. Mother, you only started pretending to love me when you realized that neither father nor grandmother would give you a cent.

19
00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.569
But that wanted me to be their heir.

20
00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:56.569
And then you did your best to manipulate Catherine, didn't you? But you think.

21
00:01:56.569 --> 00:02:04.879
Soon you grabbed onto her wife. You see, you would do anything to take control of this company you were known.

22
00:02:04.879 --> 00:02:13.879
You've known about this all along, right? And you wanted to play me for a fool? You are a despicable young man, just like your father.

23
00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:14.879
You're right.

24
00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:19.879
You don't deserve this company. You don't deserve the money. I do.
