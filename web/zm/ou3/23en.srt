1
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:32,500
If it wasn't for you, if I hadn't gone abroad,

2
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,179
I'd be the one carrying Eric's baby.

3
00:00:35,179 --> 00:00:37,560
Not you.

4
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,649
Eric, let's do and be here.

5
00:00:39,649 --> 00:00:43,539
Today, you'll be gone and both of us.

6
00:00:43,539 --> 00:00:44,539
Hey, I'm here.

7
00:00:44,539 --> 00:00:47,280
Woo, woo, woo.

8
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,039
Right, what are you doing?

9
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:51,600
What am I doing?

10
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,159
This is what it takes for you to come see me.

11
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:56,320
Wait, wait, stop!

12
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,899
Right there.

13
00:00:57,899 --> 00:00:59,859
One more step, and I'll push it over.
