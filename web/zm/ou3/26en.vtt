1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.240
It's all Scott's fault.

2
00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:04.429
He blew through the family money.

3
00:00:04.429 --> 00:00:09.750
And when you wouldn't help him, he said you and Catherine up.

4
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.750
But when your grandma made the two of you get married,

5
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.980
his plan fell apart.

6
00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.980
Even now, Eric is still going after Catherine for money.

7
00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.980
Everything Scott did left Catherine feeling guilty.

8
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.980
That's why she put up with you for so long.

9
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.980
Why else when she put up with all the things you've done

10
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.979
and even give you all her shares and money that she totally deserves?

11
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.400
She's awake.

12
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:30.469
You speak now?

13
00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:31.469
That's amazing.

14
00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:35.650
He's my brother.

15
00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:36.650
You're best friend.

16
00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.340
You're carrying a baby.

17
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.340
You need to rest now.

18
00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.950
You need to rest more.

19
00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:48.950
A baby?

20
00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.909
Is it a heart baby?

21
00:01:50.909 --> 00:02:02.829
Are we married?

22
00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:06.829
The patient suffered a severe head injury

23
00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:09.830
which caused temporary amnesia.

24
00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.830
The fact that she spoke suddenly

25
00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.020
which suggests that her language systems have always been attacked.

26
00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:24.900
Her inability to speak is most likely caused by psychological factors.

27
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:25.900
Oh, don't worry about that.

28
00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.900
She told me before the surgery.

29
00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:52.569
How are you feeling now?

30
00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:53.569
Who is he?

31
00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:55.909
Eric.

32
00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:57.580
You're ex.

33
00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.580
You've known him for some time.

34
00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.889
Eric?

35
00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:06.039
You really don't remember me.

36
00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:34.219
Don't press her too much.

37
00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:35.219
She needs to rest.

38
00:03:35.219 --> 00:03:43.539
I'll be right back.

39
00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:50.379
How could you be so selfish?

40
00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:52.379
How dare you speak to me like that?

41
00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:54.379
Once the last time, we're happy.

42
00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:57.379
And I'm not talking about pretending to be happy.

43
00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:59.819
Actually happy.

44
00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:00.819
You know what?

45
00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:02.819
She's better off without you.

46
00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:05.259
Shut.

47
00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:11.189
It costs a scene.

48
00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:12.189
We're in a hospital.

49
00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:13.189
All right?

50
00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:15.189
None of this will help Catherine.

51
00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:37.769
I want to go home with William.

52
00:04:37.769 --> 00:04:47.839
Cheers to Catney on your life.

53
00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:52.529
I'm so happy for you too.

54
00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:54.939
What was I like before?

55
00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:57.170
You've been through a lot.

56
00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:59.170
It's better for you to just live in the present.

57
00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:00.170
Catherine, just remember.

58
00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:01.170
I'm your husband.

59
00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:07.069
And we're in love.

60
00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:08.069
OMG.

61
00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:10.069
I just had the best idea.

62
00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:13.069
You two haven't taken your wedding photos yet.

63
00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:15.230
You should go do that right now.

64
00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:17.230
That's an excellent idea.

65
00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:20.819
Okay.

66
00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:21.819
What about this one?

67
00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:26.829
Something that's got changed.

68
00:05:26.829 --> 00:05:46.339
Do you really not remember?

69
00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:49.100
Yes.

70
00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:51.100
I remember you.

71
00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:52.100
You're Eric.

72
00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:55.250
What are you doing here?

73
00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:56.250
Come home with me.

74
00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.730
Why are you doing this with William?

75
00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:02.180
William is my husband.

76
00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:03.180
And I love him.

77
00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:04.180
No.

78
00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:08.310
It's not.

79
00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:09.540
You're confused.

80
00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:10.600
Okay?

81
00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:13.600
Come home with me and we'll sort all this out.

82
00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:32.860
And Catherine can't live without you.

83
00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:33.860
Let go of her now.

84
00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.079
You need to leave her alone.

85
00:06:36.079 --> 00:06:37.079
All right.

86
00:06:37.079 --> 00:06:38.079
She's not happy with you anymore.

87
00:06:38.079 --> 00:06:39.079
What do you know about us?

88
00:06:39.079 --> 00:06:40.079
Huh?

89
00:06:40.079 --> 00:06:41.079
What do you know about her happy?

90
00:06:41.079 --> 00:06:44.079
What I do know is that she's miserable with you.

91
00:06:44.079 --> 00:06:47.750
Every day is a pain for her and I can't watch it any longer.

92
00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:49.750
You have to let her live.

93
00:06:49.750 --> 00:07:10.149
You don't know yet, but we're expecting.

94
00:07:10.149 --> 00:07:12.149
What?

95
00:07:12.149 --> 00:07:13.149
Expecting already?

96
00:07:13.149 --> 00:07:14.149
That's ridiculous.

97
00:07:14.149 --> 00:07:17.149
What do you think we're doing in the gynecology office?

98
00:07:17.149 --> 00:07:19.470
Catherine, is this true?

99
00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:22.500
I'll catch you later, Eric.

100
00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:27.430
It was a pleasure.

101
00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:28.430
Eric?

102
00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:29.560
You hear that Leo?

103
00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:31.560
Catherine, William, we're expecting.

104
00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:44.949
Do you remember Eric now?

105
00:07:44.949 --> 00:07:53.920
It's okay.

106
00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:55.920
He's in the past for a reason.

107
00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:57.110
You can leave him there.

108
00:07:57.110 --> 00:08:09.509
Surprise.

109
00:08:09.509 --> 00:08:12.509
I woke the cruise ship for you too.

110
00:08:12.509 --> 00:08:17.509
My friends with the kids tell me all the time that once the baby comes vacations become a luxury.

111
00:08:17.509 --> 00:08:19.800
That's so sweet.

112
00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:20.800
Thanks, Andrew.

113
00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.800
You're so welcome.

114
00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:26.800
And before you set sail, we're gonna have a baby shower.

115
00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:27.800
And don't worry.

116
00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:38.990
I already took care of all the invitations.

117
00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:41.990
I just found out that William was on the brink of bankruptcy.

118
00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:43.990
But suddenly received a large lump sum investment.

119
00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:46.629
It came from Catherine.

120
00:08:46.629 --> 00:08:50.779
She sold off all her shares in us.

121
00:08:50.779 --> 00:08:53.960
She was willing to do all of that from...

122
00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:58.870
Ms. Catherine is indeed pregnant.

123
00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:06.570
Sir, Missy had just us back.

124
00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:13.450
Eric, we'd like to extend an invitation to our baby shower.

125
00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:23.320
We'd love for you to join us, mother.

126
00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:25.600
You're doing this to me.

127
00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:26.629
Please come.

128
00:09:26.629 --> 00:09:28.629
Well, that is if you have time.

129
00:09:28.629 --> 00:09:32.299
I really like my childhood best friend to be there.

130
00:09:32.299 --> 00:09:33.299
What did you say?

131
00:09:33.299 --> 00:09:35.299
The invitation has been delivered.

132
00:09:35.299 --> 00:09:36.299
Okay.

133
00:09:36.299 --> 00:09:37.370
We'll see ourselves out.

134
00:09:37.370 --> 00:10:17.740
My little angel is six weeks old now.

135
00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:19.639
What do you think it is?

136
00:10:19.639 --> 00:10:21.639
A boy or a girl?

137
00:10:21.639 --> 00:10:24.600
I think she's a girl.

138
00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:41.019
There are lingering effects from the concussion.

139
00:10:41.019 --> 00:10:46.019
Our previous assessment may have been overly optimistic.

140
00:10:46.019 --> 00:10:50.139
The patient may experience complete amnesia later on.

141
00:10:50.139 --> 00:10:52.879
What can we do, Doug?

142
00:10:52.879 --> 00:10:59.649
Currently, the only effective method is to repeatedly remind her of any memories she may have lost.

143
00:10:59.649 --> 00:11:00.649
Write everything.

144
00:11:00.649 --> 00:11:02.649
Take her to an old spot.

145
00:11:02.649 --> 00:11:05.649
Maybe watch a familiar movie.

146
00:11:05.649 --> 00:11:08.649
See if you can hit any triggers.

147
00:11:08.649 --> 00:11:14.860
Good morning.

148
00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:16.500
It's time to get up.

149
00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:18.500
We have an appointment today.

150
00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:20.429
Wait.

151
00:11:20.429 --> 00:11:21.429
Who are you?

152
00:11:21.429 --> 00:11:22.779
I'm a William.

153
00:11:22.779 --> 00:11:24.230
I'm your husband.

154
00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:26.710
We were expecting a child together.

155
00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:30.769
Also, the doctor is expecting us this morning, so...

156
00:11:30.769 --> 00:11:36.860
I'm sorry, baby.

157
00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:38.860
Mommy keeps forgetting about you.

158
00:11:38.860 --> 00:12:15.970
What are you doing here?

159
00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:16.970
This is my home.

160
00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:20.860
You remember me now.

161
00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:24.860
You're Eric, my ex, and my childhood best friend.

162
00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:30.250
And what about William?

163
00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:31.250
Who is William?

164
00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:33.460
He's your husband.

165
00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:35.679
It's okay.

166
00:12:35.679 --> 00:12:36.679
Come in.

167
00:12:36.679 --> 00:12:52.860
He's what your favorite cartoon when you're a kid.

168
00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:53.860
Catherine.

169
00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:56.080
He's scared.

170
00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:57.080
Come, let's go.

171
00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:58.080
I'll take you home.

172
00:12:58.080 --> 00:12:59.210
Okay?

173
00:12:59.210 --> 00:13:00.210
He's William.

174
00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:16.940
I'll probably go with him.

175
00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:19.419
Are you trying to convince me to give up?

176
00:13:19.419 --> 00:13:21.419
She's made her choice already, William.

177
00:13:21.419 --> 00:13:23.019
This is her home.

178
00:13:23.019 --> 00:13:25.019
She said it herself.

179
00:13:25.019 --> 00:13:30.309
I mean, I...

180
00:13:30.309 --> 00:13:33.269
I was willing to let her go.

181
00:13:33.269 --> 00:13:36.679
Let her be with you, but...

182
00:13:36.679 --> 00:13:42.769
You're right.

183
00:13:42.769 --> 00:13:45.830
William, I caused her so much pain.

184
00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:49.750
But I guess...

185
00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:52.750
her heart's still mine, even if her brain's not.

186
00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:57.759
No, it's much just...

187
00:13:57.759 --> 00:13:58.759
I hate to admit it.

188
00:13:58.759 --> 00:14:00.860
You're right.

189
00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:03.179
She'll wake up tomorrow and totally forget about me.

190
00:14:03.179 --> 00:14:04.179
She remembers you.

191
00:14:04.179 --> 00:14:06.750
Maybe not my name, but...

192
00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:08.750
she knows who you are.

193
00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:12.320
I'm begging you, William.

194
00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:13.320
Please let her stay with me.

195
00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:15.320
I'll give you whatever you want.

196
00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:20.450
Keep in your company.

197
00:14:20.450 --> 00:14:21.450
All of it.

198
00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:22.450
Take it.

199
00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:30.399
William, Catherine's the most important thing in my life.

200
00:14:30.399 --> 00:14:33.429
It took me nearly losing her to see that.

201
00:14:33.429 --> 00:14:34.429
Forget it.

202
00:14:34.429 --> 00:14:40.779
I don't want the company.

203
00:14:40.779 --> 00:14:42.899
She should be with you.

204
00:14:42.899 --> 00:14:43.899
She took me a favorite.

205
00:14:43.899 --> 00:14:46.309
Mm-hmm.

206
00:14:46.309 --> 00:14:47.309
Take care of her.

207
00:14:47.309 --> 00:14:48.759
Take care of that baby.

208
00:14:48.759 --> 00:14:50.559
Take...

209
00:14:50.559 --> 00:15:10.129
No, what today is...

210
00:15:10.129 --> 00:15:13.139
What's today?

211
00:15:13.139 --> 00:15:17.159
Today is the day that...

212
00:15:17.159 --> 00:15:19.799
We can be with...
