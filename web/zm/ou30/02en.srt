1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,950
Are you okay?

2
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,710
I'm fine for me.

3
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:17,890
I'm so sorry I couldn't save the house.

4
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:18,890
Don't worry.

5
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:20,890
As long as we're together,

6
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:23,890
we'll get through this difficult time.

7
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:28,769
Is there anything else in there?

8
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:29,769
No.

9
00:00:29,769 --> 00:00:30,769
This is it.

10
00:00:30,769 --> 00:00:33,659
One second.

11
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:34,659
Okay, I'll be right back.

12
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:36,259
Hello?

13
00:00:36,259 --> 00:00:38,490
Lisa, where are you?

14
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:40,490
Don't you remember we were supposed to meet

15
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:42,490
in the conference room at 9.

16
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:45,490
Manager Smith's gone crazy looking for you.

17
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:46,490
I'm so sorry that something unexpected

18
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:49,490
happened at home and if you could please

19
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:51,490
just tell management that...

20
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:54,000
Hello?

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
No, no, no.

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,149
I just lost my house and now I'm

23
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:02,149
going to lose my job too.

24
00:01:02,149 --> 00:01:05,150
Where am I going to find a million dollars?

25
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:08,879
Lisa?

26
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:12,290
Why are you crying?

27
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:13,290
Um...
