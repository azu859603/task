00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
Mr. Hawthorne, what are you doing here?

2
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.000
I'm actually here for you.

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.000
What?

4
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I need a marriage card card.

5
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.480
Again, what?

6
00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.480
I need you to be my wife.

7
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.609
Give it a thought.

8
00:00:12.609 --> 00:00:19.210
Mr. Hawthorne, I was really drunk last night,

9
00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.210
and I can't remember how everything happened after, but you really don't...

10
00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.210
Well, I know some unfortunate things have happened in your family recently.

11
00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:32.060
This card has more than enough on it to pay off all your debts,

12
00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.060
and make sure your house doesn't get auctioned off.

13
00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.380
If you agree, we can get the marriage certificate right now.

14
00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:48.740
Why do you want to help me?

15
00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:53.219
I told you, I need a wife, and you're the most suitable person.

16
00:00:53.219 --> 00:01:02.740
It's for my family.

17
00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.250
I have no other way.

18
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.040
Mr. Hawthorne, thank you so much for helping me.

19
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.040
I promise I will pay you back every cent as soon as I can.

20
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.040
You don't pay me back? More than happy.

21
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.739
I'm gonna get back to work then.

22
00:01:19.739 --> 00:01:22.829
Ronan will actually take you back.

23
00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:25.829
And I'll give you my home address, so you can move in tonight.

24
00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:27.829
Your home address?
