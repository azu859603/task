1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,480
We're legally married. It's wrong with living a gun.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:08,580
Right. This is a deal. I can't just take the money and give nothing in return.

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:13,580
I can get myself to work. And I'll be back on time, it's me.

4
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:22,500
Oh, Lisa. You're finally mine.

5
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:29,850
I'm so sorry. It was a great day in emergency.

6
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:37,679
Oh, no worries. It's fine. Can I have your name?

7
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:38,679
Oh, Lisa.

8
00:00:38,679 --> 00:00:45,340
Never knew Mr. Hawthorne would have such a silly smile moment.

9
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:53,700
All right. It's real? If your mom finds out you married a Cinderella.

10
00:00:53,700 --> 00:01:00,409
All right, I give it to her. They want your mom.

11
00:01:00,409 --> 00:01:04,469
You really married Mr. Hawthorne? It's just a contract marriage.

12
00:01:04,469 --> 00:01:06,469
Shh, it's a pay-to-tay.

13
00:01:06,469 --> 00:01:09,469
Next is the Lisa Hawthorne.

14
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:12,469
You are the CEO's wife. So where is my favorite?

15
00:01:12,469 --> 00:01:15,469
We've known each other since medicine.

16
00:01:15,469 --> 00:01:17,469
I don't think he actually likes me.

17
00:01:17,469 --> 00:01:23,519
Plus, everyone in the company knows who he actually wants to be a man.

18
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:25,519
Heart is back.
