00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,019
Hello, everyone. Please, help yourself to have some cake.

2
00:00:05,019 --> 00:00:08,099
Thank you, Ms. Hart. You are so very kind.

3
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:09,859
It's really such an honor to work with.

4
00:00:09,859 --> 00:00:12,339
Please, don't flatter me.

5
00:00:12,339 --> 00:00:17,019
I have to go see Mr. Hawthorne right now. He must want to see me right now.

6
00:00:17,019 --> 00:00:19,859
Save a slice for me.

7
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:22,579
When do you think they will make their own relationship public?

8
00:00:22,579 --> 00:00:23,699
I'll please see him.

9
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:26,859
Last time I asked when I saw Mr. Hawthorne unlock his phone,

10
00:00:26,859 --> 00:00:31,660
the code of 090 is for its birthday, and isn't that looking too on you?

11
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:35,740
Well, I never knew Mr. Hawthorne would be so romantic, and using puts on a poker face.

12
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:42,200
Amelia, my relationship with Mr. Hawthorne is still talking about you.

13
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:55,539
Okay.

14
00:00:55,539 --> 00:01:01,909
090 3. At summer's birthday again.

15
00:01:01,909 --> 00:01:06,659
They love each other so much that it's okay, whatever it is.

16
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:08,420
It's just not getting as many things.

17
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:18,140
Why aren't you coming up?
