00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:02,270
Why aren't you coming in?

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:04,269
Mr. Hawthorne, I think that we should do.

3
00:00:04,269 --> 00:00:28,109
What should I do? Am I supposed to sleep with him tonight?

4
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:32,109
I know that we did that before, but I was drunk.

5
00:00:32,109 --> 00:00:39,219
If I turn him down, will he get angry? But if I don't.

6
00:00:39,219 --> 00:00:41,219
What is up? You okay?

7
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:56,179
I'm fine. Thank you for asking.

8
00:00:56,179 --> 00:00:58,380
I'm not ready.

9
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:02,079
I was just going to turn off the light.

10
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,659
What do you think I was going to do?

11
00:01:04,659 --> 00:01:09,200
Oh, yeah. No. Don't get me wrong. I just meant I wasn't ready to sleep yet.

12
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:16,079
I don't want someone nightstand. I want to be your everything.
