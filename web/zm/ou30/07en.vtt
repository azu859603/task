00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:04.660
Matthew, why did the negotiations with the sunlight could fail?

2
00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:06.759
It's Elisa's fault.

3
00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:09.759
If she hadn't skipped work that day, we could have succeeded.

4
00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:13.759
How is it her fault? Please give me a reasonable explanation.

5
00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:21.760
I heard someone saw Mr. Hawthorne entering her hotel room the night before Elisa skipped work.

6
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.260
What? What did you say to me?

7
00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:25.760
It is absolutely true.

8
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:33.759
Not only did she cause our failure, but she dared to seduce Mr. Hawthorne when you were away.

9
00:00:33.759 --> 00:00:45.270
Matthew, you know how important our negotiations with the sunlight group is.

10
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.270
And since it is your subordinate's fault, you know what to do with Elisa.

11
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:59.590
Mr. Shird, I know what to do.

12
00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.590
Last night, with Lush and Elisa, I couldn't sleep at all.

13
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.680
Elisa, is this how you do your job? Look what trouble you brought us.

14
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.680
It is because of you that we lost the project with the sunlight group. You're fired.

15
00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.969
Mr. Clark, I was only in charge of the initial budget, not the negotiations.

16
00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:21.969
I don't understand how this could be my fault.

17
00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:24.969
Did you forget about your unexcused absence last time?
