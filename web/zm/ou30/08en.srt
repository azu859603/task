1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,560
Did you forget about your unexcused absence last time?

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,480
That's because something unexpected happened at home,

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:06,839
but I called in for a leave of ask.

4
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:08,320
So, what?

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,039
We needed you last minute and you weren't there.

6
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:12,759
Now that the project has failed,

7
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:15,320
if you're not to blame, who else would it be?

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,480
I was absent that day, yes,

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,920
but I prepared the initial budget ahead of time

10
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,559
so there is no way that my absence

11
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:25,710
would have affected the negotiations.

12
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,190
Wouldn't have affected the negotiations?

13
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:30,550
Elisa, take a closer look.

14
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:32,429
What did you write in a project budget?

15
00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:37,880
No, no, no, this isn't right.

16
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,799
I wrote 50 million.

17
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:41,359
How did it become five million?

18
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:48,460
For a professional budget analyst,

19
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:51,219
you've made such a sloppy mistake.

20
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:54,500
Elisa, do you have anything else to say for yourself?

21
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,380
Well, it's like Elisa isn't trouble.

22
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,500
Elisa always strikes me as a professional.

23
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,740
How could she make such an error?

24
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:04,260
Keep it down, can't you see?

25
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:10,069
It's just trying to find something to your responsibility.

26
00:01:10,069 --> 00:01:13,269
Wait, I have evidence to prove that my budget was correct.
