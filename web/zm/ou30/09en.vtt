00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Evidence? Then why don't you show it to everyone?

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I have the date, it's or smiles on my computer that can show that I had the right numbers.

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
No, no they were right here, how could they be gone?

4
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Elisa, are you joking? Where's your so-called evidence?

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Elisa, are you suggesting that Mr. Clark and Ms. Hart are conspiring against you?

6
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
You better pack up and leak now before making a bigger fool out of yourself.

7
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
What are you saying? I've seen the budget Elisa made.

8
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.859
We all checked it as a team. Obviously someone tampered with it.

9
00:00:35.859 --> 00:00:37.859
Are you saying that we are framing her?

10
00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:41.859
At the very least, she deserves a good reason to be questioned.

11
00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:46.859
Fine, if anyone else can vouch for Elisa, I can give her a second chance.

12
00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:48.859
Anyone?

13
00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:54.840
Aren't you there when we check that time? I don't remember.

14
00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:04.980
Since there's no one, Elisa, would you like to walk yourself out or would you like me to have someone escort you out?
