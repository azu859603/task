00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.600
It's better to be something important.

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.000
Mr. Hawthorne, the business department is an uproar.

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.480
So, can't some her handle it?

4
00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:09.519
She started it.

5
00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:12.880
Her and Mr. Clark are trying to fire Mrs. Hawthorne.

6
00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.460
Let's go.

7
00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.140
Amelia, it's okay.

8
00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.699
They clearly just want someone to blame for this entire thing.

9
00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:21.899
So what should we do then?

10
00:00:21.899 --> 00:00:23.899
Allow them to push all the blame onto you?

11
00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.660
Ms. Hart? Mr. Clark?

12
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.899
I'll step down from my position,

13
00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:33.460
but I will never admit to mistakes that I didn't make.

14
00:00:34.179 --> 00:00:36.259
I will get down to the bottom of this.

15
00:00:36.259 --> 00:00:37.060
You're shameless.

16
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:38.979
The evidence is right here.

17
00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:41.619
Where do you get the nerve to deny it?

18
00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:44.500
Besides the project book, there's also surveillance footage

19
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.179
in our computer backend logs.

20
00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:48.659
All of these will prove that my budget was correct,

21
00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:50.420
and I will investigate this until the end.

22
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.750
There is no need for an investigation.

23
00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.229
You have already been fired.

24
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.840
Since you refuse to leave, security?

25
00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:03.280
And track her out.

26
00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:13.900
Alisa, you dare to seduce the man I like when I'm not around?

27
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.299
You'll never sit for him often, you ever again.

28
00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:23.469
Summer? What are you doing?
