1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.280
Why is he here? Could it be? He's here to support Summer?

2
00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.280
Who should? What brings you here?

3
00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.380
Let her go.

4
00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.519
What's going on with these two? Am I fired or not?

5
00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.660
Could it be? I'm just a pawn in their game.

6
00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:17.420
Character explain what's going on?

7
00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.339
Well, Elisa made a big mistake at work, so I fired her.

8
00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.739
But she refused to leave, disrupting everyone at work.

9
00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:27.739
So, Matthew called security to escort her out.

10
00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:29.059
Fired for what?

11
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.899
Here's the thing, Mr. Hawthorne.

12
00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:34.899
The negotiations with the sunlight will fail due to Elisa's mistake.

13
00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:37.380
We had to let her go according to company regulations.

14
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.179
You set me up with some half-baked plan.

15
00:00:40.179 --> 00:00:42.420
Tried to fire me and then called security.

16
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.740
Is that within the lines of regulation?

17
00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:49.299
Elisa, how dare you question company regulations in front of Mr. Hawthorne?

18
00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:50.500
Who should see?

19
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.020
She wouldn't admit her mistakes, and she even questioned your public.

20
00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.210
Oh god, not really fired.

21
00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.700
Elisa actually talked back to Mr. Hawthorne.

22
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.379
She has to be fired now.

23
00:01:08.379 --> 00:01:09.900
I'm actually pitying her.

24
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:10.780
No matter what.

25
00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.420
Pitting her? You're an employee too.

26
00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:14.620
Mind your own business.

27
00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.900
Elisa, you're sure I'm bald, aren't you?

28
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.019
Elisa, don't you know what Mr. Hawthorne means?

29
00:01:22.019 --> 00:01:23.620
Hurry up and beep.

30
00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.540
Of course, Lucian is on somewhere's side.

31
00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:27.939
I'm just his wife out of nowhere.

32
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.489
Surely I'm no match for his lover.

33
00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:38.930
Hold on.

34
00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:44.659
Did I try to leave?

35
00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:45.939
Do you're not angry?

36
00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:47.709
I'm not being angry.

37
00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:50.829
The company needs to find out who's responsible for Sunrise Group Project first.

38
00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:52.620
Ronan takes charge of that.

39
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.060
Yes, Mr. Hawthorne.

40
00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.659
So what you're saying is I'm not fired.

41
00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:57.579
At least for now.

42
00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.549
Lucian, Elisa not only made mistakes on this project,

43
00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:05.469
but she was absent from work without permission,

44
00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:06.829
and she defied you in public.

45
00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:08.430
So I'll handle company policy, okay?

46
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.840
But we never, ever,

47
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.120
fire an employee for no reason.

48
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.169
I, I agree with Lucian.

49
00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.389
Matthew, I told you to wait until the investigation was done,

50
00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:23.389
but you insisted that the results were clear.

51
00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:26.349
Apologize to Mr. Hawthorne right now.

52
00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:27.310
Yes, Ms. Hart.

53
00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.949
Is Lucian helping me?

54
00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:33.949
But as a CEO, he needs to do things fairly in front of his employees.

55
00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.270
This proves nothing.

56
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:37.550
Lucian, I have a few words with you.

57
00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.090
Elisa, you are damn lucky this time.

58
00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.250
But you won't be for the next time.

59
00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:59.539
Mr. Hawthorne, if this is about the project,

60
00:02:59.539 --> 00:03:01.460
then I'm so sorry that you were bothered.

61
00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:02.819
Do you think that's why I brought your hair?

62
00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:07.250
Do you think that's why I brought your hair?

63
00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.330
Next time something like that happens, come see me.

64
00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:10.770
Don't let me handle it.

65
00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:13.490
You're so busy.

66
00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:14.770
I didn't want to bother you.

67
00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.280
We're married.

68
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.539
We can do whatever you want.

69
00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:23.500
The office.

70
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.300
Full around.

71
00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:25.580
Full around?

72
00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:31.500
Well, that's the proper thing since we're married.

73
00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:32.699
By that, I guess you mean.

74
00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:37.729
I should act like your wife all the time, even while we're at work.

75
00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:40.879
That's not necessarily what I mean.

76
00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.699
Well, if that's wrong, stir Hawthorne.

77
00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:45.979
I guess I'll be going back to work.

78
00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.810
Lisa.

79
00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.919
Stay away from my room.

80
00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:05.840
Well, Elisa, when you were in Mr. Hawthorne's office,

81
00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:06.639
I mean it's hard.

82
00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:09.229
I can't really understand that you know over here.

83
00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:10.349
Can you help me, please?

84
00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.009
Ms. Hart, may I help you?

85
00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:21.490
You are still under investigation.

86
00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:25.410
Now, isn't the current time for you to be working on company projects?

87
00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.610
But I was just looking over the project budget for the next thing.

88
00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.889
Your current mission is to go downstairs and fetch me a cup of coffee.

89
00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:33.490
Can't you see the trash is full?

90
00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.610
Clean it.

91
00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:36.509
Ms. Hart.

92
00:04:37.329 --> 00:04:38.689
I'm an analyst.

93
00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:39.649
I'm not an intern.

94
00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:40.449
What?

95
00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.250
Are you defying your superior?

96
00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:44.850
Someone is really ignorant.

97
00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:46.529
She hasn't been glorified yet.

98
00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:48.449
Now she's defying her superior.

99
00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:50.610
Does she think she owns the company?

100
00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:51.410
Right?

101
00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:54.689
Ms. Hart is not just a daughter of a noble family.

102
00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:57.889
She also has an unusual relationship with our president.

103
00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:00.769
It will be your best interest to help Ms. Hart with the trife.

104
00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:03.329
Stop being ungrateful.

105
00:05:03.329 --> 00:05:06.930
Elisa, I can have you fired for defying your superior.

106
00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:09.490
So you better choose wisely.

107
00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.930
You're right.

108
00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:16.209
I like my job and I'm going to become an excellent executive in my dream company.

109
00:05:17.149 --> 00:05:17.470
Fine.

110
00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:20.000
I'll do it.

111
00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:28.980
Better to bend than break, huh?

112
00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:30.339
It doesn't matter.

113
00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:32.980
Let's see how one you can keep tolerating.

114
00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:37.569
Ms. Hart, your coffee.

115
00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:39.410
Hand it to me.

116
00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:49.920
I'll be so hot.

117
00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.279
You almost burned me alive.

118
00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:52.800
Oh my god, I'm so sorry.

119
00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:53.759
Are you okay?

120
00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:56.079
Don't you know I only drink ice Americano?

121
00:05:56.079 --> 00:05:57.680
Who hired you anyway?

122
00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:58.879
I'm so sorry.

123
00:05:58.879 --> 00:05:59.920
I will go by one minute.

124
00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:02.000
Can't you see this coffee on the floor?

125
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:02.959
Clean it up.

126
00:06:02.959 --> 00:06:03.600
Now.

127
00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:12.339
Who told you you could pop the floor with that?

128
00:06:12.339 --> 00:06:13.779
If you damage the floors.

129
00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:15.779
Can you afford to pay for them?

130
00:06:15.779 --> 00:06:18.660
How exactly would you like me to mount the floor to Ms. Hart?

131
00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:21.540
With a cloth on your hands and knees.

132
00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:23.139
Inch by me.

133
00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:25.970
So where do you think you're going a little too far?

134
00:06:26.769 --> 00:06:27.089
What?

135
00:06:27.089 --> 00:06:28.209
Can't handle it?

136
00:06:28.209 --> 00:06:29.329
You could always quit.

137
00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:41.230
By that I guess you mean they should act like your wife all the time.

138
00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:42.350
Even all around work.

139
00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:48.689
Mr. Hawthorne, there's an upcoming online meeting with an overseas company.

140
00:06:48.689 --> 00:06:53.339
Although, hey, is the business department next to the meeting room?

141
00:06:53.339 --> 00:06:54.699
Yes, Mr. Hawthorne.

142
00:06:54.699 --> 00:06:56.060
It's ahead of us first.

143
00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:58.000
Just the department.

144
00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.040
This is Hawthorne and Exhore.

145
00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.519
So we're here to see her be completely in love with that, sorry.

146
00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:06.269
Ms. Hart, would you please lift your foot?

147
00:07:07.069 --> 00:07:12.860
Do it.

148
00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:18.019
I sent you a solution when I was away.

149
00:07:18.019 --> 00:07:20.019
Have you ever thought of today?

150
00:07:21.329 --> 00:07:22.930
I didn't sit to see him.

151
00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:23.490
Yes!

152
00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:27.410
Do you really think I wouldn't know because I was away?

153
00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:28.290
You did?

154
00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:31.810
This is the solution, then you must be prepared for my room.

155
00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:34.290
So what the hell are you doing?

156
00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:38.339
What the hell are you doing?

157
00:07:38.339 --> 00:07:38.899
Motion.

158
00:07:39.779 --> 00:07:42.100
At least it's still on her investigation, right?

159
00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:44.740
She's not suitable for working on company projects,

160
00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:48.420
so I had her doing simpler tasks like fetching me coffee.

161
00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:50.660
But she spilled the coffee on purpose.

162
00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:51.540
That isn't true.

163
00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:53.779
It doesn't matter anyway, I don't blame her for it.

164
00:07:53.779 --> 00:07:55.379
But she insisted on wiping it out.

165
00:07:55.379 --> 00:07:57.379
I stepped on her by accident.

166
00:07:57.379 --> 00:07:59.540
I was about to apologize to her.

167
00:08:00.259 --> 00:08:01.220
That's so.

168
00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:03.519
She always says that actually what happened?

169
00:08:03.519 --> 00:08:05.040
Motion is in love with someone.

170
00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:07.860
Even if I told the truth, would he believe me?

171
00:08:09.199 --> 00:08:10.079
Yes.

172
00:08:10.079 --> 00:08:10.720
It's the truth.

173
00:08:11.819 --> 00:08:12.699
Come with me to my office.

174
00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:15.279
Come.

175
00:08:17.339 --> 00:08:20.939
Why on earth did Lucian call Eliza to his office again?

176
00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:22.459
He must find out.

177
00:08:28.769 --> 00:08:29.250
Have a seat.

178
00:08:31.199 --> 00:08:32.000
Your hands hurt.

179
00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:33.840
You need advantage.

180
00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:35.279
It's really fine.

181
00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:36.960
I can just go home and...

182
00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:37.759
No, no, I got it, all right.

183
00:08:38.639 --> 00:08:39.600
Have a seat.

184
00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:46.159
All right, let's see.

185
00:08:46.159 --> 00:08:47.759
You know, summer is competent.

186
00:08:48.559 --> 00:08:51.120
But she can be bossy and overbearing.

187
00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.559
I can transfer you to another department.

188
00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:55.070
Can't bear her.

189
00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:56.139
Maybe not.

190
00:08:56.139 --> 00:08:57.490
It means no more time, you know.

191
00:08:57.490 --> 00:09:01.379
Oh, I'm fine in the possessed apartment.

192
00:09:01.379 --> 00:09:02.340
Eliza, you're my wife.

193
00:09:03.549 --> 00:09:05.389
I don't want she to be bullied anymore.

194
00:09:05.389 --> 00:09:09.549
Stop pretending like you don't know she only does that because she's in love with you.

195
00:09:09.549 --> 00:09:10.110
Okay.

196
00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:11.629
Last step.

197
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:14.720
Okay.

198
00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.720
Just don't let this hand touch water for a moment.

199
00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:17.200
Thank you.

200
00:09:18.139 --> 00:09:20.509
Mr. Hoffman.

201
00:09:20.509 --> 00:09:21.470
Just the two of us.

202
00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:25.169
Call me by my name.

203
00:09:25.169 --> 00:09:26.289
I thought I shouldn't.

204
00:09:26.289 --> 00:09:27.570
Hell, I shouldn't, shouldn't.

205
00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:29.649
Lucian, why did you marry me?

206
00:09:29.649 --> 00:09:31.250
And why do you keep defending me?

207
00:09:32.269 --> 00:09:33.710
Do you really not know why?

208
00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:36.159
I don't know each other since high school,

209
00:09:36.159 --> 00:09:38.159
but he's always kind of ignored me.

210
00:09:38.929 --> 00:09:40.610
Hasn't he always had a thing for summer?

211
00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:50.669
Or could it be that everyone has been wrong all along?

212
00:09:50.669 --> 00:09:52.190
Bloody, Eliza.

213
00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:54.990
You sure are good at playing naive?

214
00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:57.149
I must find a way to teach you a lesson.

215
00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:01.100
A reunion, Dorothy.

216
00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:03.019
The gods are favoring me.

217
00:10:03.659 --> 00:10:13.919
Eliza, I must teach you a lesson this time.

218
00:10:13.919 --> 00:10:15.309
It's ready.

219
00:10:15.309 --> 00:10:16.750
How many slices do you want?

220
00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:18.269
Come on, what's wrong?

221
00:10:18.909 --> 00:10:24.350
Eliza, isn't our house supposed to be auctioned off by the court to pay off our debts?

222
00:10:26.289 --> 00:10:27.889
Why hasn't this happened yet?

223
00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:36.210
Um, well, I borrowed some money from a friend to help pay off the debts.

224
00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:40.159
The court lent you so much money at once.

225
00:10:42.269 --> 00:10:45.870
Since we went bankrupt, all our old friends have disappeared.

226
00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:50.980
Mom, you don't have to worry about it.

227
00:10:51.539 --> 00:10:52.700
If you so.

228
00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:59.419
Hey, Eliza, what took you so long?

229
00:10:59.419 --> 00:11:00.379
What's up?

230
00:11:00.379 --> 00:11:02.539
There's a school reunion party this weekend.

231
00:11:02.539 --> 00:11:07.500
They notified us in the group, but I figured you haven't read it yet since you did respond,

232
00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:09.179
so I'm just giving you a heads up.

233
00:11:09.179 --> 00:11:10.299
It's been ages.

234
00:11:11.019 --> 00:11:13.340
Why is there a high school reunion party out of nowhere?

235
00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:17.340
Here's the monthly report from the business department.

236
00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:18.539
I'll just leave it over there.

237
00:11:18.539 --> 00:11:27.409
Why don't we grab a drink tonight?

238
00:11:27.409 --> 00:11:28.850
I know a good place.

239
00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:29.889
I actually have plans tonight.

240
00:11:31.539 --> 00:11:33.299
If you don't have anything else, you can leave.

241
00:11:33.299 --> 00:11:35.220
Lucian, it's been so long.

242
00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:36.899
Summer, I said I'm busy.

243
00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:38.580
Please, leave.

244
00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:43.330
Hold on.

245
00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:45.009
Will you be at the high school reunion?

246
00:11:45.009 --> 00:11:46.690
Summer, how many ways do I have to say this?

247
00:11:46.690 --> 00:11:47.250
I'm busy.

248
00:11:47.809 --> 00:11:48.129
Leave.

249
00:11:49.149 --> 00:11:51.950
Lucian, you have to be so gentle with me.

250
00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:55.629
But ever since Eliza came, I've become a courtroom holder.

251
00:11:56.899 --> 00:12:04.299
Eliza, don't think that you are teasing me.

252
00:12:04.299 --> 00:12:07.179
I wonder if Lucian received the invitation to the reunion.

253
00:12:08.139 --> 00:12:09.259
Is he going?

254
00:12:09.259 --> 00:12:10.620
Something on your mind?

255
00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:11.659
That's not a big deal.

256
00:12:11.659 --> 00:12:14.220
But there's the high school reunion party later.

257
00:12:15.309 --> 00:12:16.350
Are you going?

258
00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:18.480
Are you going?

259
00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:18.960
I don't know.

260
00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:21.090
I knew I made a good point,

261
00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:23.330
but we don't really see each other that often.

262
00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:25.090
Thought it'd be nice to get together.

263
00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:26.269
Oh, you know what?

264
00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:28.960
I actually have a meeting.

265
00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:29.840
I think I'll pass.

266
00:12:30.639 --> 00:12:30.879
Okay.

267
00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:35.139
I'll send you something though since I can't do that.

268
00:12:35.139 --> 00:12:35.620
Thank you.

269
00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:36.980
You really don't know if to do that.

270
00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:39.379
I know it's far, so take this.

271
00:12:41.409 --> 00:12:42.370
Lucian, it's...

272
00:12:42.769 --> 00:12:44.529
That's way too expensive.

273
00:12:44.529 --> 00:12:45.649
I'm just going to take this up way.

274
00:12:46.929 --> 00:12:50.289
Eliza, I'm capable of offering you a better life.

275
00:12:50.289 --> 00:12:51.330
Why would you take this up way?

276
00:12:52.289 --> 00:12:53.169
Consider this a gift.

277
00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:57.200
Lucian is acting like he actually likes me.

278
00:12:58.190 --> 00:12:59.629
What game is he playing?

279
00:13:00.509 --> 00:13:01.549
Mine.

280
00:13:01.549 --> 00:13:02.029
Take it.

281
00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:05.629
You're just giving this to me?

282
00:13:06.659 --> 00:13:07.539
One, your husband.

283
00:13:08.559 --> 00:13:09.759
Link Lee's speaking.

284
00:13:09.759 --> 00:13:10.559
Mine is yours.

285
00:13:12.259 --> 00:13:13.460
Well, thank you then.

286
00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:20.299
Personalized version.

287
00:13:20.299 --> 00:13:21.980
It's probably cost millions.

288
00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:23.419
Jesus, Eliza.

289
00:13:23.419 --> 00:13:26.220
If it weren't for you, I'd never get a B in such a luxurious car.

290
00:13:26.879 --> 00:13:29.919
Seems like Mr. Hawthorne really is madly in love with you.

291
00:13:29.919 --> 00:13:32.480
You know, I'm still at the point where I'm wondering if he even likes me.

292
00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:34.659
Does treat me well though?

293
00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:37.840
You know, all of us passwords are still summer's birthday.

294
00:13:38.399 --> 00:13:39.519
I don't know.

295
00:13:40.399 --> 00:13:41.519
I'm probably just overthinking.

296
00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:46.320
Maybe it's, um, a misunderstanding or a coincidence?

297
00:13:47.539 --> 00:13:50.019
I feel like Mr. Hawthorne is quite cold this summer.

298
00:13:50.019 --> 00:13:51.299
I don't think he's into her.

299
00:13:51.299 --> 00:13:53.379
You know, that's just because he's trying to keep the download of work.

300
00:13:55.299 --> 00:13:58.100
Well, even if he were trying to keep it that way,

301
00:13:58.100 --> 00:13:59.539
do you know how that saying goes?

302
00:14:00.769 --> 00:14:03.889
We can try to hide our feelings, but we forget that our eyes can speak.

303
00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:08.000
The way he looks at summer doesn't feel right.

304
00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.120
Do you know what I mean?

305
00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:12.320
I have absolutely no idea what you mean because you're so crazy.

306
00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:12.799
You?

307
00:14:12.799 --> 00:14:13.759
Oh, I'm done.

308
00:14:13.759 --> 00:14:14.559
You're so mean.

309
00:14:14.559 --> 00:14:15.200
I can.

310
00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:15.679
Well, we're late.

311
00:14:15.679 --> 00:14:16.320
We have to go.

312
00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:16.639
Okay.

313
00:14:17.519 --> 00:14:27.230
Long time no see.

314
00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:29.230
So sorry, we're late.

315
00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:30.429
So it's Eliza.

316
00:14:31.309 --> 00:14:32.350
What is it?

317
00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:34.029
The poor student back then.

318
00:14:34.029 --> 00:14:35.309
He's putting his ears now.

319
00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:39.629
Did you make a sweat on purpose?

320
00:14:42.539 --> 00:14:46.139
Did you plan to arrive late deliberately to attract our attention?

321
00:14:47.019 --> 00:14:50.860
Eliza, you are still using the same lame tricks as back then,

322
00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:51.740
aren't you?

323
00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:53.500
Who wants to pay attention to her?

324
00:14:54.299 --> 00:14:58.779
After all this year, she still speaks of poverty.

325
00:14:58.779 --> 00:15:01.340
Hey, did you say so too hard?

326
00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:03.580
What if she's doing well?

327
00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:05.019
And these are the way of work.

328
00:15:05.019 --> 00:15:06.860
You wish you didn't make TV late.

329
00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:07.419
Her?

330
00:15:07.419 --> 00:15:09.419
She's probably a little level employee.

331
00:15:09.419 --> 00:15:10.779
How well could she be doing?

332
00:15:10.779 --> 00:15:11.740
What do you mean by that?

333
00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:14.299
At least her name was just...

334
00:15:14.299 --> 00:15:18.179
Oh, summer's here.

335
00:15:18.179 --> 00:15:19.940
Although it's been years since we graduated,

336
00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:21.539
she's only been more gorgeous.

337
00:15:21.539 --> 00:15:24.740
Summer is full of the dog of the noble family.

338
00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:27.460
And Mr. Hopper's child friend.

339
00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:30.580
Fast summer is more than generous now.

340
00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:31.700
Summer, come on.

341
00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:32.820
Sit next to me.

342
00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:34.019
I reserve for the thanks.

343
00:15:38.379 --> 00:15:39.259
Sorry, I'm late.

344
00:15:39.899 --> 00:15:41.179
Traffic was terrible.

345
00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:42.779
Never mind.

346
00:15:42.779 --> 00:15:44.139
It's our honor to have you.

347
00:15:44.139 --> 00:15:46.539
Summer, did you call a new sports car?

348
00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:48.509
Not really.

349
00:15:48.509 --> 00:15:50.350
I just picked this one out of the garage

350
00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:51.389
because I was in a hurry.

351
00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:53.950
I'm actually tired of driving it.

352
00:15:53.950 --> 00:15:54.830
I haven't used it.

353
00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:56.860
A sports car?

354
00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:58.700
That's something I can never afford.

355
00:15:58.700 --> 00:15:59.659
It's not that much.

356
00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:03.070
So many a few hundred likes of you.

357
00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:05.470
Wow, so much choice, rich.

358
00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:08.429
Such in this fancy carpet.

359
00:16:08.429 --> 00:16:09.789
It's fine, nothing for her.

360
00:16:09.789 --> 00:16:12.029
Naturally, you don't know who the summer is.

361
00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:14.669
Such a lottery part and nothing.

362
00:16:14.669 --> 00:16:16.269
We put the toy to her.

363
00:16:16.269 --> 00:16:17.950
She can help nearly as she wants.

364
00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:19.789
Which is not.

365
00:16:20.779 --> 00:16:21.899
Any sound?

366
00:16:21.899 --> 00:16:23.500
What car did you drive here?

367
00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:27.360
She?

368
00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:29.440
How could a poor girl like her afford a car?

369
00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:30.879
She must be taking the subway.

370
00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:33.120
What does she race?

371
00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:34.399
That's the reason.

372
00:16:34.399 --> 00:16:37.519
Elisa, the subway will soon stop running.

373
00:16:37.519 --> 00:16:39.440
Do you want me to give you a ride?

374
00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:40.559
Oh, summer.

375
00:16:40.559 --> 00:16:42.639
You're still so kind-hearted.

376
00:16:42.639 --> 00:16:45.039
But how could somebody as long as her

377
00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:47.679
be riding in your luxury car?

378
00:16:48.639 --> 00:16:51.360
Be careful not to get her power and he stands all over you.

379
00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:52.559
It probably won't come off.

380
00:16:52.559 --> 00:16:54.799
What nonsense are you talking about me?

381
00:16:54.799 --> 00:16:57.440
Elisa didn't take the subway and it wouldn't matter if she did.

382
00:16:58.500 --> 00:16:59.299
She drove here.

383
00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:03.539
And a famous new little fish had converted on her.

384
00:17:03.539 --> 00:17:06.180
Something more says in a new version.

385
00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:09.140
Oh my god, what a big mouth.

386
00:17:09.779 --> 00:17:10.579
What the hell?

387
00:17:10.579 --> 00:17:12.259
It really is a convertible.

388
00:17:12.259 --> 00:17:13.380
Impossible.

389
00:17:14.019 --> 00:17:15.539
She can never afford that.

390
00:17:15.539 --> 00:17:20.019
Elisa, did you rent a car just to show off at their union?

391
00:17:20.019 --> 00:17:21.460
It's not rented.

392
00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:22.740
Not rented.

393
00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:24.099
Who are you trying to fool?

394
00:17:24.099 --> 00:17:26.980
You can't afford even the cheapest one of such cars,

395
00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:28.259
even if you're selling yourself.

396
00:17:28.819 --> 00:17:29.220
Summer?

397
00:17:30.259 --> 00:17:32.819
Is Hawthorne going really that good?

398
00:17:32.819 --> 00:17:36.579
Even a little employee can afford such fancy convertible?

399
00:17:36.579 --> 00:17:37.220
Hardly.

400
00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:39.940
Although Hawthorne Group does have good benefits,

401
00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:41.700
it's not that extent.

402
00:17:42.579 --> 00:17:45.940
With her salary, she could probably never afford it,

403
00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:47.700
even if she worked herself to death.

404
00:17:48.799 --> 00:17:51.440
Elisa, we're all classmates here.

405
00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:53.359
You don't have to pretend to be rich.

406
00:17:53.359 --> 00:17:56.160
It probably costs half your salary to rent that car.

407
00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:57.839
It's best not to be so vain.

408
00:17:57.839 --> 00:17:58.880
What's the point of it?

409
00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:00.160
It's like the Cinderella.

410
00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:02.559
It will revert to its true form after midnight.

411
00:18:02.559 --> 00:18:04.960
Elisa, don't you find yourself ridiculous?

412
00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:06.640
Of course.

413
00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:08.640
Can they look this guy's fury?

414
00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:12.079
It was harder to disappoint you, but it's not rented.

415
00:18:12.079 --> 00:18:13.359
It's a gift from my husband.

416
00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:17.059
Mr. Hawthorne.

417
00:18:17.059 --> 00:18:18.099
Mr. Walker's arrived.

418
00:18:18.099 --> 00:18:19.460
Meeting can start anytime.

419
00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:19.779
All right.

420
00:18:20.819 --> 00:18:21.380
All right.

421
00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:23.779
By the way, my wife is having a class for you anymore.

422
00:18:23.779 --> 00:18:25.460
Invites a woman with some fine wine.

423
00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:26.180
What happened?

424
00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:26.980
Yes, Mr. Hawthorne.

425
00:18:28.339 --> 00:18:31.779
It was harder to disappoint you, but it's not rented.

426
00:18:31.779 --> 00:18:33.539
It's a gift from my husband.

427
00:18:33.539 --> 00:18:36.259
Elisa, what's the point of lying?

428
00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:39.859
First, you rent a car to show off with the reunion,

429
00:18:39.859 --> 00:18:44.339
and now you're making up a story about a wealthy husband?

430
00:18:44.339 --> 00:18:46.180
Are you living in a novel?

431
00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:48.579
Summer, aren't you colleagues with Elisa?

432
00:18:48.579 --> 00:18:50.980
You should know she's married or not, right?

433
00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:53.759
It's not my business.

434
00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:57.359
Even on her superior, I try not to pry.

435
00:18:58.589 --> 00:19:00.509
Although I don't think so.

436
00:19:00.509 --> 00:19:02.509
If she really had a rich husband,

437
00:19:03.069 --> 00:19:06.269
why would she work for so little she's married?

438
00:19:06.269 --> 00:19:08.750
So, Elisa is lying again.

439
00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:11.890
She is so shameless.

440
00:19:11.890 --> 00:19:15.170
Amelia, I think you should stay with her,

441
00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:19.569
and Elisa, she got a bet of fullness on you.

442
00:19:21.339 --> 00:19:22.140
And what do you know?

443
00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:24.779
Elisa's husband.

444
00:19:25.339 --> 00:19:25.819
Okay.

445
00:19:25.819 --> 00:19:26.299
Okay.

446
00:19:26.299 --> 00:19:27.420
You guys keep hurting.

447
00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:28.940
Amelia?

448
00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:35.170
Good man.

449
00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:37.650
These are the ones set by Mr. Hawthorne.

450
00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:43.730
You can't eat too little feet,

451
00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:46.799
but we didn't order these wines.

452
00:19:47.759 --> 00:19:49.359
I'll send you something though, since I can't either.

453
00:19:49.359 --> 00:19:51.599
The wine is for me, right?

454
00:19:51.599 --> 00:19:53.759
He did say he would send something over.

455
00:19:53.759 --> 00:19:55.599
This is too much.

456
00:19:55.599 --> 00:19:59.279
Summer, this wine must be a special gift for Mr. Hawthorne for you.

457
00:19:59.279 --> 00:20:00.079
Yeah.

458
00:20:00.079 --> 00:20:02.880
The only one among us who deserves such attention

459
00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:05.119
for Mr. Hawthorne is Summer.

460
00:20:05.119 --> 00:20:06.640
Who else could it be?

461
00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:08.559
This wine is for Mr. Hawthorne too.

462
00:20:08.559 --> 00:20:11.920
Summer and Mr. Hawthorne have been a perfect match in school,

463
00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:14.160
and now they are still so affectionate.

464
00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:16.160
I wonder if they got to get married soon.

465
00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:17.359
Of course.

466
00:20:17.359 --> 00:20:21.250
Summer switch a president's wife, unlike someone.

467
00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:23.549
Oh, Lisa.

468
00:20:23.549 --> 00:20:24.109
Missy.

469
00:20:24.829 --> 00:20:27.390
You can never shake me down the solution.

470
00:20:28.109 --> 00:20:29.069
All right, everyone.

471
00:20:29.069 --> 00:20:31.150
Send the solutions and over these wines.

472
00:20:31.150 --> 00:20:32.750
Let's enjoy them together.

473
00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:35.869
But Summer, this is 1980 to let be.

474
00:20:35.869 --> 00:20:40.990
I think some people here are not worthy of drinking such fine wine.

475
00:20:41.869 --> 00:20:43.869
They say cast your pearls before swine.

476
00:20:43.869 --> 00:20:45.390
Even if we let Elisa drink it,

477
00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:46.990
she wouldn't know how good the way a fee is.

478
00:20:47.789 --> 00:20:48.910
That's true.

479
00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:50.670
Depain to her will be a waste.

480
00:20:50.670 --> 00:20:51.309
You're all wrong.

481
00:20:52.349 --> 00:20:53.309
This wine is for me.

482
00:20:55.619 --> 00:20:56.660
This wine is for me.

483
00:20:58.099 --> 00:20:59.460
Did I hear that right?

484
00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:02.740
You said that this wine was given to you by Mr. Hawthorne.

485
00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:04.180
It's hilarious.

486
00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:06.259
Do you think you're Mrs. Hawthorne?

487
00:21:06.259 --> 00:21:08.660
Mrs. Hawthorne is Summer.

488
00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:11.460
Are you dangering me, Missa?

489
00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:14.420
Do you think you're some Cinderella who married a president?

490
00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:15.619
Elisa.

491
00:21:15.619 --> 00:21:17.299
Are you jealous of me?

492
00:21:17.299 --> 00:21:20.900
Not only jealous of my family background and my job.

493
00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:23.220
Now you're jealous of my relationship with Lucian

494
00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:25.700
and want to clean the wine so they're given to me.

495
00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:28.900
Don't you know that even if you try to harvest

496
00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:33.539
what's not meant for you will never, never be yours.

497
00:21:33.539 --> 00:21:35.650
Oh Summer, don't ruin your mood

498
00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:37.730
over such a wreck in the gutter.

499
00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:38.769
She's just a clown.

500
00:21:38.769 --> 00:21:42.289
How can you be so confident that the wine is for Summer?

501
00:21:42.289 --> 00:21:45.569
When Summer and Mrs. Hawthorne started dating,

502
00:21:45.569 --> 00:21:48.210
Elisa was some rare picking on the trash.

503
00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:50.609
All you ever do is talk.

504
00:21:50.609 --> 00:21:52.930
Where the hell would I lie about something like this?

505
00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:53.809
Who knows?

506
00:21:53.809 --> 00:21:56.130
After all, we don't understand how the court thinks.

507
00:21:56.130 --> 00:21:58.289
Hey, waiter, tell us.

508
00:21:58.289 --> 00:22:02.369
Who does Mr. Hawthorne give this wine stew?

509
00:22:02.369 --> 00:22:03.490
Yeah, Alice.

510
00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:06.049
Who does Mr. Hawthorne gives this wine stew?

511
00:22:06.049 --> 00:22:08.609
So that's someone who starts dating me.

512
00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:14.130
These wines were given to Mrs. Elizabeth by Ms. Hawthorne.

513
00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:17.809
What?

514
00:22:17.809 --> 00:22:19.569
This wine is from Lucian Twill.

515
00:22:20.769 --> 00:22:21.970
There must have been a mistake.

516
00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:23.089
Check it again.

517
00:22:23.089 --> 00:22:26.529
How could Mr. Hawthorne possibly send wine to himself?

518
00:22:26.529 --> 00:22:29.970
Yes, this is indeed the wine except for Mr. Lucian.

519
00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:31.170
To Mr. Hawthorne.

520
00:22:31.170 --> 00:22:34.059
What could this be?

521
00:22:34.059 --> 00:22:37.900
What is Elisa so special that Lucian would treat her like this?

522
00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:40.460
Why are you all so silent now?

523
00:22:41.099 --> 00:22:43.660
You were so talkative and confident before?

524
00:22:45.299 --> 00:22:46.660
Is it because you were embarrassed?

525
00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:47.940
Okay, take Amelia.

526
00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:50.180
Yeah, like I said, I don't need to learn.

527
00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:54.019
Mr. Hawthorne would never send wine to this bitch.

528
00:22:54.019 --> 00:22:54.660
Couldn't we?

529
00:22:55.779 --> 00:22:56.099
Wait.

530
00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:58.259
Now, womania.

531
00:22:58.259 --> 00:23:02.259
Elisa, you really are desperate for attention, aren't you?

532
00:23:02.259 --> 00:23:04.980
After being exposed about the car keys,

533
00:23:05.619 --> 00:23:09.299
you've resorted to hiring actors to put on a show for us.

534
00:23:09.299 --> 00:23:10.180
Oh my god.

535
00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:12.579
Covenia, you really are imaginative.

536
00:23:12.579 --> 00:23:13.619
You should have a screenwriter.

537
00:23:13.619 --> 00:23:14.900
You really gotta hit on your hands.

538
00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:16.019
What?

539
00:23:16.019 --> 00:23:19.140
Are you really agitated because I've uncovered the truth

540
00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:21.460
and here I am stating the facts.

541
00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:22.819
How is that imagination?

542
00:23:24.319 --> 00:23:27.119
Amelia, I think you've got a point.

543
00:23:27.119 --> 00:23:34.240
After all, ladies and people are always so desperate for attention, right?

544
00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:39.200
Summer makes about coin.

545
00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:42.079
Mr. Hawthorne and Elisa are completely different worlds.

546
00:23:42.079 --> 00:23:43.920
How could he possibly send her wine?

547
00:23:44.559 --> 00:23:47.039
Go home and pay your actors.

548
00:23:48.369 --> 00:23:50.930
And Elisa, I think there's something you should know.

549
00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:53.890
If we hadn't gone to the same high school together,

550
00:23:53.890 --> 00:23:57.089
you wouldn't have any chance of sitting here with us,

551
00:23:57.089 --> 00:23:59.890
having meal, not alone getting to know.

552
00:23:59.890 --> 00:24:03.250
Mr. Hawthorne, you all have gone too far.

553
00:24:03.809 --> 00:24:06.289
This is supposed to be a class reunion party

554
00:24:06.289 --> 00:24:07.890
and you're all targeting Alisa.

555
00:24:07.890 --> 00:24:09.089
What are you trying to do?

556
00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:11.089
What are we trying to do?

557
00:24:11.970 --> 00:24:13.809
She needs to know her place.

558
00:24:13.809 --> 00:24:17.009
Instead of deceiving us with lies again and again,

559
00:24:17.009 --> 00:24:19.970
how dare she do it and not admit it.

560
00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:22.210
Yes, summer as the saying goes,

561
00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:24.210
ugly people make more trouble.

562
00:24:24.210 --> 00:24:28.289
But poor people make even more trouble.

563
00:24:28.289 --> 00:24:30.529
I couldn't care less what you think of me,

564
00:24:30.529 --> 00:24:33.089
but I didn't hire actors for this.

565
00:24:33.089 --> 00:24:35.490
We are all regular employees of the hotel.

566
00:24:35.490 --> 00:24:38.130
We cannot be hired as private actors.

567
00:24:38.130 --> 00:24:39.410
You must have misunderstood.

568
00:24:46.849 --> 00:24:47.809
Misunderstood.

569
00:24:48.769 --> 00:24:51.009
And Elisa, you really are hopeless.

570
00:24:51.650 --> 00:24:55.329
You found some actors that got two bottles of fake wine

571
00:24:55.329 --> 00:24:57.890
thinking you could show off at the reunion party.

572
00:25:07.819 --> 00:25:10.700
This cheap wine is only good for making noise when he shatters.

573
00:25:14.190 --> 00:25:16.829
With this order from President Hawthorne,

574
00:25:16.829 --> 00:25:21.140
I don't have to worry about my performance for the rest of the month.

575
00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:22.900
I think I'm going to make this fail.

576
00:25:23.619 --> 00:25:26.259
A VVIP custom from now on.

577
00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:35.119
I'm coming over.

578
00:25:35.119 --> 00:25:36.880
Damaging some of the property.

579
00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:38.960
Lavinia, you have never been one to consider

580
00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:41.759
the consequences of doing whatever summer tells you to do.

581
00:25:41.759 --> 00:25:45.200
How much can a fake bottle of wine work?

582
00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:48.319
I'll pay her and it would remain one.

583
00:25:48.319 --> 00:25:51.759
He can smash number one.

584
00:25:54.990 --> 00:25:56.109
You're disgusting.

585
00:25:56.829 --> 00:25:58.829
We're ashamed to have you as a classmate.

586
00:25:59.470 --> 00:26:01.390
You don't deserve to be at our party.

587
00:26:01.390 --> 00:26:02.109
Security.

588
00:26:02.109 --> 00:26:03.069
Where is security?

589
00:26:03.069 --> 00:26:03.950
At my interests.

590
00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:06.349
Well, we don't know what this woman is

591
00:26:06.349 --> 00:26:08.750
and I don't know how she got in here

592
00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:10.269
and I want her out of here.

593
00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:12.670
Well, this is Summer Heart,

594
00:26:13.390 --> 00:26:16.750
Beyonce of the President of Hawthorne School.

595
00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:18.910
And having her here,

596
00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:20.589
we don't want to have any trouble.

597
00:26:20.589 --> 00:26:21.069
Misunderstood.

598
00:26:22.099 --> 00:26:23.220
Now, what are you doing?

599
00:26:25.779 --> 00:26:27.140
What is going on here?

600
00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:32.700
Who gave you permission to expel my esteemed guest?
