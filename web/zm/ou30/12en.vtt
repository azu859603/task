00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.799
Did you just call Elisa an esteemed guest?

2
00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:05.799
Yes, I did.

3
00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:12.199
In fact, a Ms. Vale is one of our VIP customers.

4
00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:14.199
That can't be possible.

5
00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:16.699
Her family went bankrupt years ago.

6
00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:18.699
She probably can't even afford to pay her rent.

7
00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:21.199
Let me correct myself.

8
00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:25.000
Not only is Ms. Vale our esteemed guest,

9
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.699
not only is she our VV VIP customer,

10
00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:33.100
but the forehand was ready to be sent by President Hawthorne

11
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.100
to her.

12
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.600
Does my word count?

13
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.799
Does it have any weight around here?

14
00:00:37.799 --> 00:00:40.799
Mr. Carlos, there must be some mistake.

15
00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:43.799
Well, the wine was personally arranged

16
00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:47.200
by President Hawthorne's personal assistant,

17
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.200
Ronin.

18
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.700
How could there possibly be a mistake?

19
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.200
Summer, how could Mr. Hawthorne be sending wine to Elisa?

20
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.829
How am I supposed to know what Lucian is thinking?

21
00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:02.429
You said that you would pay me back tenfold.

22
00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:03.630
Forget the tenfold.

23
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.260
Just pay me the original price.

24
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.760
Is Lucian going to be angry with me for this?

25
00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:10.260
Whatever.

26
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
Let's just enjoy this moment.

27
00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:13.260
What's going on?

28
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.959
President Hawthorne really sent the wine to Elisa.

29
00:01:15.959 --> 00:01:17.760
I have to let you.

30
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:23.359
Maybe someone is just lying and she's being cosmonious about this hour.

31
00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:27.359
So Summer, what's the best way for you to pay me back for this?
