00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
You should have seen the look on Summer's face when she tried to swipe her card.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
It was hilarious.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Oh my gosh, today we finally showed her who's boss.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I know, but I feel like everyone knows that Summer is Lucian's dream girl.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
When he finds out, I, the placeholder wife, am totally getting the...

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,579
Legally, you are Mr. Hawthorne's wife.

7
00:00:21,579 --> 00:00:23,579
You are literally the President's wife.

8
00:00:23,579 --> 00:00:26,579
You have the high ground, what are you so afraid of?

9
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:27,579
Come on.

10
00:00:27,579 --> 00:00:28,579
Let's go drink and celebrate.

11
00:00:28,579 --> 00:00:30,579
You actually don't need your drink right now?

12
00:00:30,579 --> 00:00:31,579
Yes.

13
00:00:31,579 --> 00:00:32,579
No.

14
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:33,579
Yes.

15
00:00:33,579 --> 00:00:34,579
No.

16
00:00:34,579 --> 00:00:35,579
Okay.

17
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:41,469
Okay.

18
00:00:41,469 --> 00:00:42,469
Emilia.

19
00:00:42,469 --> 00:00:43,469
Be honest with me.

20
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:44,469
Okay.

21
00:00:44,469 --> 00:00:45,469
What is it?

22
00:00:45,469 --> 00:00:48,469
I don't understand why Lucian wanted to marry me.

23
00:00:48,469 --> 00:00:50,210
I don't know.

24
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:51,210
It's just...

25
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,240
I'm starting to feel like maybe he...

26
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,240
Like...

27
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,590
See, actually someone really...

28
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:57,590
Hey, Lisa.

29
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:01,590
I have something I have to attend to, so I'm going to be leaving now.

30
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:02,590
What?

31
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:03,590
Wait, no.

32
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:07,590
Are you gossiping about me behind my back while you're drunk?
