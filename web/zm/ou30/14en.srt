1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Are you real?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Or am I dreaming?

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Well no, you're not dreaming.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I'm actually here to take you home.

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Big gossip?

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
No.

7
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I don't want to go home.

8
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I want to drink more.

9
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Listen.

10
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We've got too much.

11
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,120
We're not heading tomorrow.

12
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,120
Who knew Mr. Hawthorne was so gentle and thoughtful?

13
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,120
Come on.

14
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,120
I can't walk.

15
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,120
So I could just live here.

16
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,120
Okay.

17
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,120
I will carry you back then.

18
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,049
Come on.

19
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:33,049
You got to hear me?

20
00:00:33,049 --> 00:00:34,049
I don't want to.

21
00:00:34,049 --> 00:00:35,049
Okay.

22
00:00:35,049 --> 00:00:36,049
Here we go.

23
00:00:36,049 --> 00:00:42,740
Mr. Hawthorne.

24
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:46,350
I'm working overtime in the middle of the night.

25
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:48,420
I'm driving at this speed.

26
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:49,420
Mr. Hawthorne.

27
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:50,420
Mr. Hawthorne.

28
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,420
Mr. Why did you marry me?
