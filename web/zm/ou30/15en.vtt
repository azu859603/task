00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Christian, why did you marry me?

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Actually, I've been in love with you for 10 years, ever since I first saw you.

3
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.750
Back then, the internal struggles in the Hawthorne family were severe, and my father was also.

4
00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:21.920
Christian, I care about the rest of this.

5
00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.089
You're all I've got now.

6
00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:34.310
Anyway, I didn't dare to show you even a sliver of my feelings for you.

7
00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.310
But the hatred between our parents made me hide my feelings for you.

8
00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:38.810
Could you give me a chance?

9
00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.090
Yes.

10
00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.990
Yeah.

11
00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:44.990
Well, I'll tell you this another time.

12
00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:56.070
Alisa always goes against me, making me embarrassed. She's the worst.

13
00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:02.070
I have an idea that doesn't require us to get involved and can make Alisa leave Mr Hawthorne.

14
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.070
Oh.

15
00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.200
What is it?
