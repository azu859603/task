1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
What is it?

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,320
Everyone knows that Mr. Hawthorne is devoted to his mother.

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:10,320
If we tell her about Elisa seducing Mr. Hawthorne, then...

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,599
Good idea. Mia is the matriarch of the Hawthorne family.

5
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,800
She's very clever, but she never got involved in the family business and

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,600
she's lived in seclusion abroad for years. Even I haven't spoken to her.

7
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:30,879
All we need to do is send an anonymous text message to Mrs. Hawthorne.

8
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:35,200
Then we just need to wait for Elisa to be expelled from the Hawthorne family.

9
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:45,549
I went through great lengths to get this, but I never contacted her,

10
00:00:45,549 --> 00:00:51,869
because I didn't have a reason. Do it for me. When Elisa is dealt with, you will be rewarded.

11
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:04,129
It's my pleasure to help you, Miss Hart. I just hope that when you become the president's

12
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:07,090
wife, you won't forget me. Of course not.

13
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:18,450
Be sure, Hawthorne, you received an anonymous message on your phone.

14
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:20,530
What does it say?

15
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:24,849
It says, as a fixed singer, Mr. Hawthorne, she charming so much that he's been

16
00:01:24,849 --> 00:01:27,090
ignoring his or through good fears.

17
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,340
Book me a flight. I need to go back immediately.
