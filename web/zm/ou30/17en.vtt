00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:03.549
I'm gonna be late again today.

2
00:00:03.549 --> 00:00:05.549
Oh my god! I'm so sorry.

3
00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.740
Oh. I'm so sorry.

4
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.740
You need to pay for this.

5
00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:10.740
Oh.

6
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.740
It was you that bumped into me and it was just a light touch.

7
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.740
I have no idea how you must have fallen like that.

8
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:16.739
Are you trying to leave me?

9
00:00:16.739 --> 00:00:18.739
Because I don't know what's the matter with your generation.

10
00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:21.739
I mean, no respect for the elderly.

11
00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:23.739
What? How did I?

12
00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:24.739
Okay.

13
00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:26.739
Here, can I help you get up first?

14
00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:29.769
Mom, are you gonna help me up?

15
00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:33.560
Are you okay?

16
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.560
No, I am not okay. My leg really hurts.

17
00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.560
I don't think I'm gonna be able to walk.

18
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.560
You need to take responsibility for this.

19
00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.560
How can a young girl be so bad?

20
00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:42.560
She hit somebody.

21
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.560
Doesn't want to take responsibility.

22
00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:45.560
She looks good.

23
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.560
But she's on me on the inside.

24
00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.560
No, no, no. The truth is...

25
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:50.560
Never mind.

26
00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:51.560
Okay.

27
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.560
Ma'am, do you have your family's contact information?

28
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.560
I can help you reach out to the family.

29
00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.710
Who are my family?

30
00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.939
I don't remember.
