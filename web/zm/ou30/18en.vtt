00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
You don't remember who your family is?

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Uh, I don't remember anything.

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.000
What do I do?

4
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
You don't remember where you live?

5
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I don't remember anything.

6
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Okay.

7
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000
What do I do?

8
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I...

9
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
How about I take you to the hospital and then to a police station?

10
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.030
No, no, no, no.

11
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.030
I'm not going to a hospital or a police station.

12
00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:22.030
I don't trust anybody.

13
00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:23.030
Oh no.

14
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:24.030
I'm going to be late.

15
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.030
But there's the weekly department meeting today.

16
00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.030
I can't take leave.

17
00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:32.579
Okay, uh, ma'am, since you're not going anywhere,

18
00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.579
how about I take you to my company office?

19
00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.579
And then after work, I'll help you find your family.

20
00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:39.579
Fine.

21
00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:41.579
Guess you need to take responsibility for this.

22
00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.579
You cannot leave my slot.

23
00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:44.579
Okay.

24
00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:45.579
Okay.

25
00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:47.579
Oh, oh, oh.

26
00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:48.579
What?

27
00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:49.579
My mom's returning home?

28
00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:50.579
Yes, Mr. Hawthorne.

29
00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.579
According to Mayor Jack Robinson's assistant,

30
00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:55.579
Mayor Jack Robinson received an anonymous text message about you

31
00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:56.579
and rushed back into the country.

32
00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:57.579
What was the text?

33
00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:00.579
He said, Mr. Hawthorne, you've been enchanted by seductors.

34
00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:02.579
She's always had a temper.

35
00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:03.740
Okay.

36
00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.739
I'm going to attend the business meeting personally.

37
00:01:05.739 --> 00:01:08.739
Are you afraid the Mayor Jack Robinson will suddenly come to our company?

38
00:01:08.739 --> 00:01:11.739
I mean, yeah, unless there's some unexpected twist,

39
00:01:11.739 --> 00:01:12.739
I should probably be there.

40
00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:13.739
All right, Mr. Hawthorne.

41
00:01:13.739 --> 00:01:14.739
I'll arrange it right away.

42
00:01:14.739 --> 00:01:20.780
Mom, please don't scare off the wife I've finally got.
