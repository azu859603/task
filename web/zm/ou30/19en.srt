00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,080
How did the matter about matriarch Robinson go?

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:10,599
Rest assured, Ms. Hart, it's said that matriarch Robinson was furious upon hearing the news and returned home immediately.

3
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:12,199
Really?

4
00:00:12,199 --> 00:00:14,880
Let me leave, so we'll be out of here soon.

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,230
Yes.

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:19,269
Congratulations in advance, Ms. Hart.

7
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:20,109
Let's go.

8
00:00:20,109 --> 00:00:24,469
There's a weekly meeting of the Business Department, and there should be there personally.

9
00:00:24,469 --> 00:00:27,769
We can't afford to make a mistake.

10
00:00:27,769 --> 00:00:35,340
Amelia's gone on a work trip, so you can sit in her spot while she's gone.

11
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,060
If you get bored, you can just put on my phone.

12
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:41,500
I don't know what therapy, and we have to keep our voices down, because people are working.

13
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,899
Okay, I just want to know if I can say this to everyone.

14
00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:47,219
A weekly meeting is about to begin.

15
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:49,820
Alyssa, why did you bring a cleaner to work?

16
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:55,179
Alyssa really treats the company as her home being anyone she likes.

17
00:00:55,179 --> 00:00:58,659
Seriously, so filthy. It's disgusting just working at them.
