1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
Elisa, our entire department has showed up with work, and you?

2
00:00:05,719 --> 00:00:09,240
If we have to delay our work, are you going to take responsibility for that?

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:14,679
Ms. Hart, this woman might have some trouble with her memory, so I'm only bringing her here temporarily.

4
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:21,280
I was going to help her find her family after work, and if she could just sit here for the time being, I'd promise that she won't disturb anybody.

5
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:26,960
Do you mean you brought this old hag in off the street, and she's also sick?

6
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:33,520
I think you're crazy. Picking up an old hag like this, reading of poverty, stinking up the whole office.

7
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,000
Where did you find her in a sewer?

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,439
What if this old hag isn't just mentally ill, but also could infect us all with some disease?

9
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:46,560
Yeah, Ms. Hart really think we should call a female later to disinfect every of this, ladies and men.

10
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,840
How could all of you be so cool?

11
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,439
Don't you all have families, too?

12
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:54,439
What if one of them had lost their memory, and needed your help?

13
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:56,439
Ms. Poole, she's interesting.

14
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,039
I'm not the one who's sick.

15
00:00:58,039 --> 00:00:59,159
You're sick!

16
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,679
Disgusting, Alyssa.

17
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:05,159
Our company has rules and regulations.

18
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:08,040
It's not a place for you to show your kindness.

19
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:11,159
Get this old hag out of here now.

20
00:01:13,459 --> 00:01:16,180
Get this old hag out of here now.

21
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:20,739
Ms. Hart, there is nothing in our company policy that discourages helping somebody in need.

22
00:01:20,739 --> 00:01:22,659
In fact, it encourages us to do so.

23
00:01:22,659 --> 00:01:23,859
Oh, there isn't.

24
00:01:23,859 --> 00:01:25,459
Well, now there is.

25
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,540
Do you have a problem?

26
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:30,859
Ms. Hart is a senior leader in our company.

27
00:01:30,859 --> 00:01:35,099
She can represent our president, and now she just happened to add another company rule.

28
00:01:35,659 --> 00:01:39,420
Even if she asks security to drag you out, there's nothing you can do.

29
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:39,980
Understand.

30
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:44,900
How come you employees of a business department like this?

31
00:01:45,859 --> 00:01:48,420
Lucian will be here soon from the business department.

32
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,500
Alyssa, you have two minutes.

33
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:54,420
If you don't get this old hag out of here, I will fire you.

34
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,659
You can go back on the street with her.

35
00:01:56,659 --> 00:01:58,659
Maybe then you'll make more money than you do now.

36
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:02,700
So, Summer, you are really pushing it.

37
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,420
Tell me, what else can you do besides flaunt your authority?

38
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,939
I'm reporting you to Mr. Hart Ford.

39
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:12,810
As a well-level employee, you have contradicted me one too many times.

40
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:15,449
And now, you dare go see Mr. Hawthorne?

41
00:02:15,449 --> 00:02:16,490
You're fired.

42
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:19,830
Two years.

43
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:23,990
Two years away from this company, and I never thought that the business department

44
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:26,310
at the Hawthorne group would decay into the state.

45
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:31,430
Alyssa will not be fired.

46
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:31,990
You will.

47
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:35,530
You will.

48
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:41,300
Okay, did I just hear this egg say she's going to fire us?

49
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,819
She has a problem with her brain.

50
00:02:42,819 --> 00:02:44,659
That's why she's talking crazy.

51
00:02:44,659 --> 00:02:50,819
It's hard to sell her president's wife to be firing her to ridiculous.

52
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:53,300
Besides memory loss, is she also crazy?

53
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:56,900
Why are they saying president's wife?

54
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:58,900
Isn't it you?

55
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,419
Are all of you quite finished?

56
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:01,939
Can't believe how shallow you are.

57
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,659
You are kind and righteous.

58
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:07,460
Do you never use Alicia's identity to gain power?

59
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:08,780
But you?

60
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,780
Okay, ma'am, it's okay.

61
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,460
I'm going to help you find your family.

62
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,099
Let's go.

63
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:14,139
Why do we need to leave?

64
00:03:14,139 --> 00:03:15,180
Why don't they leave first?

65
00:03:15,979 --> 00:03:16,780
Fine.

66
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,379
Since you're determined to cling to us.

67
00:03:18,939 --> 00:03:21,979
At you, get this old hag out of here right now.

68
00:03:29,669 --> 00:03:30,469
You've got guts.

69
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:33,909
I'll see who dares to kick me out of here today.

70
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,900
You actually dared to hit me.

71
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:46,150
Ms. Hart?

72
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:49,110
Alyssa, this woman attacked my subordinate.

73
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:51,509
I could have her sent to a mental hospital.

74
00:03:51,509 --> 00:03:52,949
You don't have the authority.

75
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:53,990
Of course I do.

76
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:55,430
She hit my subordinate.

77
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:57,990
I can reasonably deduce she has some mental issues.

78
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:59,830
How many times do I have to tell you?

79
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:01,349
Yes, this woman is clearly sick,

80
00:04:01,349 --> 00:04:04,150
but naturally I'm going to find her family to let them handle it.

81
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:07,129
If you and Matthew haven't instigated this,

82
00:04:07,129 --> 00:04:08,330
none of this would have happened.

83
00:04:08,969 --> 00:04:11,370
This woman's actions can only be described as self-defense.

84
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:13,449
Yeah, I think you're the one who's crazy.

85
00:04:13,449 --> 00:04:14,969
You don't respect the elderly.

86
00:04:14,969 --> 00:04:17,050
You're not qualified to be a leader.

87
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:19,769
I don't know why your company's higher ups even chose you.

88
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,040
Oh, are you angry?

89
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:31,209
To disappear from my sight!

90
00:04:31,209 --> 00:04:32,250
Security!

91
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,089
Go both of them on a path on group.

92
00:04:36,819 --> 00:04:38,899
With me here, I can't drive you away.

93
00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:41,779
I'll tell you, I am.

94
00:04:41,779 --> 00:04:42,819
Sorry, what are you doing here?

95
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,110
Sorry, what are you doing here?

96
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:53,240
Oh my god, why does Lucian come to the business department every day?

97
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:53,560
Fine.

98
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,120
I guess we'll have another show then.

99
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,079
Just wait.

100
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:57,959
Well, it's like this.

101
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:00,279
Alyssa brought this woman in off the street,

102
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:03,480
who's most terrible and insisted on having her in the office,

103
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,639
which was disrupting everyone's work,

104
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,480
so I'm only thinking of the company.

105
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,759
Yes, Mr. Hawthorne.

106
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:12,439
What if she has some contagious disease and infects everyone?

107
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:15,000
I take full responsibility for this incident.

108
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,959
If the company wishes, I can handle my resignation.

109
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,540
Hawthorne Group is not an impersonal company.

110
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:23,589
Alyssa's done well.

111
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:26,569
From today forward,

112
00:05:26,569 --> 00:05:28,250
we'll be promoted to team leader,

113
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,769
and oversee projects as a reward.

114
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:35,589
Mr. Hawthorne, I'm afraid I'm not qualified for this position.

115
00:05:35,589 --> 00:05:38,230
I believe everyone here knows your abilities well.

116
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:42,790
As for you, you can go to HR,

117
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:44,069
and they'll handle your resignation.

118
00:05:46,149 --> 00:05:48,629
He is the backbone of the business department.

119
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:51,029
If you fire him, there'll be no elites left.

120
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:53,509
Summer, you manage the business department into a mess.

121
00:05:53,509 --> 00:05:54,709
You're responsible for that.

122
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:58,149
I promise to manage the business department better.

123
00:05:58,149 --> 00:05:59,269
If this won't happen again,

124
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:03,589
Matthew, why have you not apologized to this madam and misfailient?

125
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:10,970
Matthew, why have you not apologized to this madam and misfailient?

126
00:06:14,329 --> 00:06:16,970
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

127
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:18,569
Why are you apologizing first?

128
00:06:18,569 --> 00:06:21,129
This one almost just put me into a mental hospital.

129
00:06:21,129 --> 00:06:22,329
Who owns time?

130
00:06:22,329 --> 00:06:24,649
Who dare you ask me to apologize?

131
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:25,850
Miss Hart?

132
00:06:27,129 --> 00:06:27,850
Apologize.

133
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:32,949
Sorry. I'm sorry. I can't hear you.

134
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:40,540
I was wrong. I'm sorry.

135
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:42,620
And you guys?

136
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:46,779
I'm sorry.

137
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,060
Sorry.

138
00:06:50,579 --> 00:06:53,139
Have I been misunderstanding him all this time?

139
00:06:53,139 --> 00:06:54,100
Could it be?

140
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,019
Well, that's the end of that matter.

141
00:06:56,019 --> 00:07:01,100
I'll take care of this lady and help her find her family.

142
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,819
Listen, why did you call me over?

143
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:07,500
What police have find out?

144
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,420
Well, what exactly are you trying to do?

145
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:12,779
I want to test my daughter-in-law.

146
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:14,139
How can you test at her enough today?

147
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,379
She's great. You saw that.

148
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,980
Oh, listen.

149
00:07:23,259 --> 00:07:24,939
You're quite loyal, aren't you?

150
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:27,139
It's enough.

151
00:07:29,209 --> 00:07:29,529
Fine.

152
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,759
Look, um, Alyssa is a very good girl,

153
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:38,199
but it seems she doesn't even know that you like her.

154
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:41,160
Nor does anyone else know that she's your wife.

155
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,639
Why are you keeping this marriage so?

156
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:44,199
Secretive.

157
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:47,000
I don't know how to tell her.

158
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,160
I'm afraid that if we make our relationship public,

159
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:51,879
pressure will be too much for her.

160
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:55,560
Lucian, when didn't you become such a coward?

161
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,839
Look, if you like her, just confess boldly.

162
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:05,000
You don't want to wait until Lisa falls for some other guy before you feel regret, do you?

163
00:08:06,389 --> 00:08:07,029
Regret what?

164
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:11,029
Nothing.

165
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:11,910
Please, come sit.

166
00:08:16,019 --> 00:08:20,420
Alyssa, I'm sorry, I deceptive earlier.

167
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,500
I'm actually Lucian's mother.

168
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:25,699
What?

169
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:29,930
Please, let me explain.

170
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:37,690
Um, a few days ago I got an anonymous text saying that some woman was trying to seduce Lucian,

171
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:41,049
and I got afraid that he might get tripped.

172
00:08:41,769 --> 00:08:43,929
Anyway, Alyssa, can you please forgive me?

173
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:50,039
Yes, Mrs. Hawthorne, I understand.

174
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:51,480
You're just looking out for your son.

175
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:55,320
But I am concerned that the person who sent that text must have had that intentions.

176
00:08:55,879 --> 00:08:57,480
I have an idea who sent it.

177
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,360
Go ahead.

178
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:58,679
Good.

179
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:00,679
And Alyssa?

180
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:04,840
I heard that Lucian plans on taking you to a very fancy dinner tonight.

181
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:06,200
Okay.

182
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:09,000
There's actually something I want to talk to you about.

183
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:21,240
How should why aren't you eating?

184
00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:30,710
Yeah, Alyssa, what do you want to ask me?

185
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,809
If you wanted to force, it's not going to happen.

186
00:09:34,809 --> 00:09:36,330
Why would you think I wanted to force?

187
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,919
I've been meaning to ask you.

188
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:48,330
You've liked summer for 10 years.

189
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:51,590
Ben, why would you marry me?

190
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:54,230
Why protect me at every turn?

191
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:56,309
Well, what?

192
00:09:56,309 --> 00:09:58,470
You think I've liked summer for 10 years?

193
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:02,230
Judging by his reaction, he must have been caught off guard.

194
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:04,470
Alyssa, you're being too presumptuous.

195
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:07,429
Seriously, why would I have liked her for 10 years?

196
00:10:07,429 --> 00:10:10,740
Alyssa, I've liked you for 10 years.

197
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:15,860
How could that persevere?

198
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,299
Today we met.

199
00:10:17,299 --> 00:10:18,100
I've helped for you.

200
00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:24,309
But because of the conflict between our parents, I chose to get them.

201
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:29,460
I wanted to show you that I cared for you, but I couldn't.

202
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:31,700
I was afraid that it would put you in danger.

203
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,600
I'm really sorry, Alyssa.

204
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,659
All these years, I've suppressed my feelings for you.

205
00:10:39,669 --> 00:10:43,750
I fought tooth and nail to be the head of the whole of our family.

206
00:10:45,139 --> 00:10:46,820
And now it's taken me a decade to

207
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,399
fully stand by you like this.

208
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:50,759
So why now?

209
00:10:53,909 --> 00:10:58,059
And now it's taken me a decade to fully stand by you like this.

210
00:10:58,860 --> 00:10:59,500
So why now?

211
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:02,860
I was afraid if I told you, you didn't like me,

212
00:11:03,419 --> 00:11:04,860
but you wouldn't even be calling anymore.

213
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:07,289
So what's wrong?

214
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:10,070
So when you sat next to me, all those years ago,

215
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:12,230
it wasn't because you didn't like your food?

216
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:17,529
Hey, I don't really like this.

217
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:29,830
I'm really sorry I shouldn't

218
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:31,350
couldn't show you my feelings and the problem.

219
00:11:33,909 --> 00:11:37,639
But then why did you raise some of that love letter back then?

220
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:39,610
Well, I love that.

221
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:44,389
I remember delivering a party invitation tour from my parents.

222
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:47,429
Well, why are all your passwords somewhere's birthday?

223
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:49,269
You mean 0903?

224
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:52,200
What was that have to do with summer?

225
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,559
I don't even know her birthday.

226
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:55,639
So then what 0903 do you?

227
00:11:55,639 --> 00:12:01,879
Alyssa 0903, September 3rd, was the day of my first month.

228
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:04,600
So it was, I was all just misunderstanding?

229
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:10,090
So it was such a misunderstanding?

230
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:12,870
Listen, I love you.

231
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:16,200
I know, I tricked you into marrying me.

232
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,240
The feelings for you are absolutely true.

233
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:22,279
So can you try to accept me?

234
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:26,419
I know that our marriage started as a contract,

235
00:12:26,419 --> 00:12:28,740
but it feels real to me now.

236
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,960
I want to be with you.

237
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:37,580
I want to be with you now, and I want to be with you when we're all done.

238
00:12:37,580 --> 00:13:03,610
And finally on.

239
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:06,809
Hey, true husband and wife.

240
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,710
We don't have to give our relationships secreted from our colleagues anymore.

241
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:19,539
Lucian, I see you.

242
00:13:19,539 --> 00:13:20,899
Summer, I'd like you to meet my wife.

243
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,350
What?

244
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:25,669
Alyssa and I have actually been married for a long time.

245
00:13:25,669 --> 00:13:28,950
So you don't have to send out the list of text messages to my mom anymore.

246
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:29,830
We all like Alyssa.

247
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,320
So no matter how much we try to sow discord between us,

248
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:35,240
it's never going to work.

249
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,840
What text messages I have?

250
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,879
I have the evidence, Summer.

251
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,440
Now, considering the relationship between our families,

252
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,919
I'm going to ask you to go ahead and submit your resignation from your team.

253
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:49,429
That's for everyone else.

254
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:52,200
You all get off an hour early today.

255
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,700
And you're invited to dinner with my wife.
