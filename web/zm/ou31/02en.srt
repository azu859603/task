1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,899
I'm sorry, are we out?

2
00:00:01,899 --> 00:00:06,299
Oh, I'm Allison Miller. I am a handmade jewelry designer.

3
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:08,300
So you sell my hat online for contract marriage?

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:11,400
Oh, is that for me?

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,400
Me, thanks.

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,170
I like mine with a bit more sugar.

7
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:22,170
I'm Robert Johnson's.

8
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,170
Yeah, I know your name, Robert Johnson.

9
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:27,870
I just don't know how you'd be so hot.

10
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,870
Anyway, so are you down for this?

11
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:31,870
I mean, I know it's crazy.

12
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:32,869
I mean, I won't really cause you any trouble.

13
00:00:32,869 --> 00:00:34,869
It's just a formality, really.

14
00:00:34,869 --> 00:00:39,079
Would you be willing to marry me today?

15
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:48,100
Well, that's a bold proposal, but not interesting.

16
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:52,350
This might also be a way for me to push back against the pressure from my family.

17
00:00:52,350 --> 00:01:02,140
Well, Allison, it's definitely a first, but I accept your proposal.

18
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:04,329
Really?

19
00:01:04,329 --> 00:01:06,329
It's good marriage.

20
00:01:06,329 --> 00:01:07,329
Let's get married.

21
00:01:07,329 --> 00:01:18,109
Sarah, a woman named Allison looking for Bob Johnson.
