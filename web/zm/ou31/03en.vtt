00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:07.230

5
00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:21.539
Allison, don't take this the wrong way, but why are we so willing to marry a guy you've

6
00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.660
just met?

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.660
There's this little girl, Sarah.

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:46.719
Well, see ya.

13
00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:50.609
I win your hurt by name.

14

16
00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:02.909
