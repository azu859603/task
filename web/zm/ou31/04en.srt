1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
You CEO of MJ Group got married just like that.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,580
What about June?

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:07,480
Some pine tree for years.

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:10,080
June and I are ancient history.

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,080
It's a note of her business.

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,300
Jason, I need you to purchase a small place for me.

7
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:20,300
Something that downplaying my CEO status.

8
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,300
Don't you think you should tell Allison the truth about who you are?

9
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,800
No, yeah.

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,260
Any news on Kevin Rodriguez's recent move?

11
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,260
It's required actively.

12
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:33,560
It's meant to be playing something.

13
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,560
Kevin Rodriguez is no match for me.

14
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:41,869
Allison, you actually married someone to adopt Sarah?

15
00:00:41,869 --> 00:00:43,060
Yeah.

16
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:44,960
Hi.

17
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:45,960
I'm Robert.

18
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:46,960
Allison's husband.

19
00:00:46,960 --> 00:01:00,390
Sorry the house isn't that big.

20
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:03,390
Oh, no, don't worry about it. I'm just thankful you were willing to marry me.

21
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:16,719
Wait, how did you get such a nice place in the hills?

22
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:21,719
Oh, I've been renting it for years.

23
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:27,719
Well, I'll have to move in because the adoption agency is going to be stopping by for a home visit in a few days.

24
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:32,719
So we'll have to play the happy couple until they come and then that we can get a divorce.

25
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:34,819
Tell them I'll be a good wife.

26
00:01:34,819 --> 00:01:36,810
Yep.

27
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:40,099
Your arrangements are really thorough.

28
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:48,239
So, you seem to be pretty well off.

29
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:51,519
You're quite cancer if you don't mind me saying.

30
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:54,519
Why would you even agree to a contract marriage?

31
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:58,680
Is this like a scam?
