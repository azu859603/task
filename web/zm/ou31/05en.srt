1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,180
Is this like a scam?

2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:06,179
No. No. Not a scam. I promise.

3
00:00:06,179 --> 00:00:10,259
Like, I wanted to give you this.

4
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:12,259
Any living expenses you may have.

5
00:00:12,259 --> 00:00:15,000
Oh. No, we'll split everything equally.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,440
It's a partnership, remember?

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:28,059
Hi, Sarah.

8
00:00:28,059 --> 00:00:30,789
Hi, honey.

9
00:00:30,789 --> 00:00:33,460
So, this is Robert.

10
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:35,460
I'm going to tell you about it.

11
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:36,460
Hi.

12
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:37,460
What do you think?

13
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:38,460
You want them to be your new dad?

14
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:39,460
Yes.

15
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:40,460
Oh, look at this.

16
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:42,560
Robert, this is Sarah.

17
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,710
It's nice to meet you, Sarah.

18
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:46,710
You too.

19
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:52,009
This one's actually my favorite.

20
00:00:52,009 --> 00:00:54,329
Wait, this is only $10?

21
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:55,329
Mm-hmm.

22
00:00:55,329 --> 00:00:58,939
Allison, your talent is worth far more than $10.

23
00:00:58,939 --> 00:01:06,340
Could you help me try this on?

24
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:07,659
Yeah.
