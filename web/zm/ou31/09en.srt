00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,339
Mr. Donson's?

2
00:00:03,339 --> 00:00:07,940
Robert, have you finished those reports I asked for?

3
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:10,939
Yes, sir. They will be on your desk first thing in the morning.

4
00:00:10,939 --> 00:00:19,820
Alice Mille?

5
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:20,820
We're only for you.

6
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,690
It's your only completed your high school education, Miss Miller.

7
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:32,640
Well, I was accepted into color arts, but I had to drop out to just medical issues.

8
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,640
Do you really think you have what it takes to work at a company like this?

9
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,640
These designs are amateur at best.

10
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,640
You're wasting our time here.
