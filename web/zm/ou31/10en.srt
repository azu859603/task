00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:07,940
I thought I had a chance, but maybe I'm just not good enough.

Don't say that.

You have an incredible talent, Alison.

00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,780
Don't let anyone make you question a lot.

00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:42,759
She has extraordinary gift for design.

12
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:46,560
She has extraordinary gift for design.
