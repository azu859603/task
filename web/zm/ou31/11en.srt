1
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:12,849
I need you to figure out everything you can about Allison Miller and her connection to Robert Johnson's.

2
00:01:14,049 --> 00:01:35,629
Immediately! Listen! Hey! Oh my gosh! It's good to see you! Ava, we work together at the Crown Hotel.

3
00:01:36,189 --> 00:01:43,090
Hi! Ava, I'm so sorry. I kind of had some memory issues in college and it's all kind of fuzzy,

4
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:50,799
I don't. I don't actually remember working at the Crown Hotel. Uh, yeah, it was a long time ago,

5
00:01:50,959 --> 00:02:10,050
I guess. Hi. Hi. So, I ran into somebody today who said that we worked at the Crown Hotel together,

6
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:25,659
but I don't remember working there at all. What happened in college? Well, your mom got sick

7
00:02:27,379 --> 00:02:34,020
and you had to pay her medical bills, so you took a job at the Crown Hotel for a while.

8
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:42,639
I just wish I could remember. I just feel like there's this big chunk of my life that's just

9
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:56,669
missing. Don't worry. What's important is that you made it through and you're here now.

10
00:02:56,669 --> 00:03:30,240
You have to make it through this! I can't lose you! What's good?

11
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:57,979
Give the adoption officer. Over the home visit in the interview for Sarah's potential adopt.

12
00:03:57,979 --> 00:04:06,259
Thank you so much for coming. Appreciate it. And you must be Allison. Nice to meet you.

13
00:04:06,259 --> 00:04:21,870
So nice to meet you. Shall we? Yeah. So why is it important that you adopt Sarah?

14
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:29,709
Well, I feel like we have a lot of love to give. If you want to provide a safe and nurturing home

15
00:04:29,709 --> 00:04:38,029
for a child in need. And how long have you two been married? A whole month. Best decision of my life.

16
00:04:39,709 --> 00:04:48,300
It's quite a short time. What made you guys get married so quick? Uh, well... I'll be honest.

17
00:04:49,019 --> 00:05:09,199
This is really suspicious. Are you sure you're not just an inter-raging girl?

18
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,410
Allison is my soulmate. I couldn't win another day to make up my life.

19
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:19,410
Well, I could tell that the love you guys share is very real. And I have a great feeling about all of

20
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:40,939
this. So expect good news very soon. Thank you. Thank you so much. Oh my gosh. You were amazing.

21
00:05:42,699 --> 00:06:00,529
Have you ever thought about us being more than just a contract? Sorry, I don't know.

22
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:06,050
No, it's okay. Take all the time you need to think about it. I actually made a reservation

23
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:18,899
for us. Don't wait for you at the restroom. Listen, I call for eight o'clock, all right?

24
00:06:18,899 --> 00:06:24,100
So why don't you check your little book and find my table, please. Check it. Oh, you don't know how to read?

25
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:35,709
Allison. Adam, wow, it's been a really long time. That has been a long time. Too long. You look

26
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:42,980
amazing, just like always. You know, I was thinking this is gonna sound completely out of nowhere,

27
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:47,680
but I just bought this no big mansion down the street. It's like the one that we always used to

28
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:56,699
talk about. What do you say we give another shot, huh? You know what I mean? What do you say we give

29
00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:06,100
another shot, huh? You know what I mean? Seriously? Yeah. You abandoned me five years ago. Oh my god.

30
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:11,810
And I'm married now. So you know what? You can get lost, Adam. Oh, you're married now, huh? Yeah.

31
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:16,610
Really? Mm-hmm. Who wouldn't marry you now in your past, huh? Jason. That's a serious question.

32
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:22,209
And you need to find out everything about Allison's past. Tell me. I would. Jesus Christ.

33
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:29,180
Let's go. Hey, hey, not so fast. You know, I own part of this restaurant, all right?

34
00:07:30,379 --> 00:07:37,379
And I say that you too. Oh, and welcome to India. So take a hike. Very sorry, sir, but I'm afraid I

35
00:07:37,379 --> 00:07:44,699
have to ask you to leave. Let's just go. It's Robert Johnson's. I need to speak to the manager.

36
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:49,740
No. Wow, tough guy. What's up his phone, huh? What was that? You call your mom?

37
00:07:51,649 --> 00:07:55,649
Mr. Johnson's. I'm so sorry. Please, right this way. Thank you.

38
00:07:55,649 --> 00:07:59,250
Are you kidding me? You're going to let them in it. Well, then fine. Give me the table next.

39
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:14,060
Sorry, sir. We can't let you in. So Robert, I heard you got married. When am I going to meet

40
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:24,300
my daughter-in-law? Soon, mom. I promise. It's just all happened really fast. Well, that's all right,

41
00:08:24,300 --> 00:09:03,019
dear. Take your time, but don't keep me waiting too long. I gotta run. I'll talk to you later, right?

42
00:09:03,019 --> 00:09:19,659
Yes, sir. I'm all out of the seats. You're very welcome. You don't like mushrooms? Not really,

43
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:36,399
but... Oh my god, Robert. Oh my god, Robert. We got the job. My gosh, congratulations. I'm so proud of

44
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:42,419
you. How about I take you out tomorrow night after your medical screening to celebrate? That would be

45
00:09:42,419 --> 00:09:55,259
great. Hey, what are you doing here? I had the day off, so I thought why not spend it with my best

46
00:09:55,259 --> 00:10:02,740
friend? I can accompany you to your medical exam if you want. That's fine. I'll just catch up with you

47
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:19,519
later. Okay. Alison Miller? Um, it's okay. I got it. You're the results of your medical exam.

48
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:47,090
Here you go, Alison. Everything's perfect. Alison, I know you and Robert are getting close,

49
00:10:47,809 --> 00:10:56,110
but I think that you should not tell him about the memory loss. At least not yet. I really don't

50
00:10:56,110 --> 00:11:01,740
want to lie to him. I just don't want you getting hurt. You know, people can be so judgmental about

51
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:14,190
these things, so I just want you to be careful, right? Okay. Seven and eight. What a pleasure to have

52
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:20,029
you down with us tonight. We prepared a special dish just for you, and of course we preserve the

53
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:25,309
presidential speech for you tonight. I've arranged a lot of company events here. That's why they're

54
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:47,980
being so accommodating. Try it. And it's good. The trouble. I'm going to take a quick shower,

55
00:11:49,100 --> 00:13:03,299
make yourself up. I'm afraid I might do something inappropriate. Good night. You know,

56
00:13:03,299 --> 00:14:17,860
pretty good. This is John Sinner. You have an impure thoughts about you. Well, aren't you

57
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:32,419
going to introduce me? Nice to meet you. Call me Hila. Or better yet. Call me Aunt Hila.

58
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:48,929
I have something for you. It's a family heirloom. Possibly accepted.

59
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:54,610
Nonsense. It's a tradition for the women in our family to pass it down. I want you to have it.

60
00:15:06,299 --> 00:15:11,379
Why don't you keep it safe for me? I would hate for something to happen to such a precious heirloom.

61
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:38,059
It's so nice to meet you, Hila. Nice to meet you too. She's not like the other, is she? Not interested

62
00:15:38,059 --> 00:15:48,029
in material things. She's special. When are you going to tell her who you really are, Rob?

63
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:57,009
When are you going to tell her who you really are, Rob? I'll tell her the truth.

64
00:15:57,889 --> 00:16:06,830
When I know for sure that she loves me for who I am, not for my welfare status. I need you to make

65
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:11,309
50 copies and have them stapled and collared within the hour. Sure. Yeah, I'll get right on that.

66
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:18,320
Do you believe the incompetence? I don't know why they had his entry level nobodies.

67
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:41,809
You were so right, June. You should be running this place. I'm your best, but nothing seems to be

68
00:16:41,809 --> 00:16:49,259
good enough for her. Listen, I know it's tough, but you just have to bear it. Rumor has it June is the

69
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:59,019
CEO's fiance. They've been together for six years. Rumor has it June is the CEO's fiance. They've

70
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:05,069
been together for six years. The CEO? I wonder if everyone's sucking up to her.

71
00:17:21,309 --> 00:17:25,549
I can't wait work without my permission. No, I didn't. I was just doing my job. I don't care.

72
00:17:25,549 --> 00:17:30,349
You took too long. I'm writing you up for an unauthorized absence. June, that's not fair.

73
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:34,269
I've just completed every task that you do. I want to hear your excuses. Pack up your things.

74
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:43,420
No. I can do this. Give me a chance, okay? All you given these menial tasks.

75
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:49,339
Done. Do you think you're so capable? Prove it. Land the big client we've been pursuing,

76
00:17:49,339 --> 00:18:26,430
and I'll consider letting you keep this job. That's my disadvantage.

77
00:18:26,430 --> 00:19:49,920
Allison, how are you making progress with the client?

78
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:55,920
Remember, you can't seal the deal. Don't bother coming back. I'm going to close this deal, June.

79
00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:04,220
You can count on it. I'm going to show you. How am I supposed to face him after everything that's

80
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:12,289
happening between us? What if he refuses to set a contract? She is 22 back and three parking

81
00:20:12,289 --> 00:20:18,930
grades. You were at their wishes. Can we talk about the business proposal?

82
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:35,569
Look who it is. Yeah, we can talk business if you move on. What do you mean? I was thinking

83
00:20:37,019 --> 00:20:45,819
if you win, I'll sign your little contract. But if I win, we're going to have to be a little more

84
00:20:45,819 --> 00:21:06,289
private for me to explain that. Fine. What's the game? Adam, that's not part of the deal.

85
00:21:06,289 --> 00:21:12,049
You know, maybe I don't care what the deal is. Stop Adam, get off of me. Get off of me.

86
00:21:12,049 --> 00:21:17,630
Get your hands off before you bastard. Get your hands off before you bastard.

87
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:27,119
That gorgeous guy I've never seen him before. Is that Robert Johnson's? What is he doing here?

88
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:32,000
And what's his connection with Allison? Are they together? This is my bar.

89
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:38,660
Why don't you just get the fuck out? Oh, Mr. Big, tough businessman.

90
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:59,420
Do you want to do it, huh? You got to hit me? This ain't fucking over. Fuck you guys.

91
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:07,980
Are you okay? Sorry to give you, sir. Oh, thank you. What if he tries to retaliate?

92
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:29,579
What if he tries to get you fired or something? What matters is in your safe.

93
00:22:29,579 --> 00:22:37,059
Jim, the deal with MJ Group is off. I don't give it so much you have to do, right?

94
00:22:37,859 --> 00:22:51,740
Just make sure that bitch house. What the hell happened to your face?

95
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:56,859
Is that fucking Lisa Johnson's? Hey, you mean the C-O-E-M-J group?

96
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:02,750
Listen, he's gonna regret it, all right? I swear he got it. He must do the bitch with his.

97
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:06,990
What happened? Your face, it hurts, all right?

98
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:20,509
The moment the stock market opened, Rodriguez's assets took a pretty huge hit. They lost over $4

99
00:23:20,509 --> 00:23:36,019
billion. I suppose they'll be paying us a visit soon. Mr. Rodriguez, the reason your assets took such a

100
00:23:36,019 --> 00:23:41,869
hit is because of your son, Adam. Adam? What's he got to do with that Davis?

101
00:23:41,869 --> 00:23:45,900
Last night he attempted to assault my wife and he's been harassing her at work.

102
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:54,299
You're serious? Is this true? You assaulted his wife? We would just fucking hate it, all right?

103
00:23:54,299 --> 00:24:00,059
No one will threaten or harm my wife without consequence. How could you do this? Look, look,

104
00:24:00,059 --> 00:24:05,980
look at the mess you cost. You know, you will apologize to Mrs. Johnson's and ask for forgiveness

105
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:13,460
immediately. Let the Servers are a reminder to you, Mr. Rodriguez. The Johnson's protect the wrong.

106
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:29,329
I'll handle this right now. You have my word. Dancing with her?

107
00:24:30,859 --> 00:25:43,569
$4 billion worth of dancing. Can I sleep in your room tonight? Of course. It's not that I don't want to.

108
00:25:45,339 --> 00:26:51,089
I just didn't want to press you anywhere. I'm ready. That was incredible. I love you so much.

109
00:27:05,299 --> 00:27:23,650
Robert, some information about Allison's past. It's not in records. She gave birth during college.

110
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:33,869
Her boyfriend at the time was Adam Rodriguez into her. She suffered from near depression.

111
00:27:33,869 --> 00:27:47,119
I got a college. I heard you failed to secure the deal with Mr. Rodriguez.

112
00:27:47,680 --> 00:28:00,109
You're fired, effective immediately. May we speak with Miss Allison Miller?

113
00:28:00,109 --> 00:28:07,259
May we speak with Miss Allison Miller? Miss Miller. I want to extend my most

114
00:28:07,339 --> 00:28:13,839
seropology from my son's inappropriate behavior. What he did to you was totally unacceptable.

115
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:28,430
I want to assure you that it would never happen again. Please accept this gift as a token of our

116
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:37,940
regret. Mr. Rodriguez, I... You don't have to say anything, Miss Miller. Just know that you're

117
00:28:37,940 --> 00:29:03,660
the full support of the Rodriguez family. Look at you, brother. I had overheals in love.

118
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:07,890
That's a far cry from your Playboy days. Those days are a long time, Peter.

119
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:16,690
Allison's the only woman I want. Hey, did you ever think about that one-night stand you

120
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:23,279
had five years ago? At the Crown Hotel? Sub-drunk that night?

121
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:36,430
Burn him. Are you curious? What if she was so important? You know what? Curious.
