1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
You know, Allison, believe it or not, I was taller than Robert at one point.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:04,500
Oh.

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:05,000
Really?

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Uh, what are they all saying?

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Robert, what are they all saying?

6
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
What a surprise to see her here.

7
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
She knew we were here and it's just not coming.

8
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Allison, dear, did you know that Robert and I used to date?

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We were quite the couple back in the day.

10
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
June, that was a long time ago. Things have changed.

11
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Of course. I just thought Allison, did you know about our history?

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,800
June, maybe we should get out of here.

13
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,179
Robert and Allison are trying to enjoy their evening.

14
00:00:29,179 --> 00:00:34,859
What the hell was that?

15
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:37,859
Are you trying to ruin Robert and Allison's marriage?

16
00:00:37,859 --> 00:00:38,859
Oh, please.

17
00:00:38,859 --> 00:00:40,859
She deserves another truth but her little husband.

18
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:41,859
The truth?

19
00:00:41,859 --> 00:00:44,950
You mean like how you don't rob her because he wasn't good enough for you?

20
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:48,880
You had no idea he was CEO of the company, did you?

21
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,880
No.

22
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:53,880
You were too busy chasing some rich exec, trying to find something better.

23
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,060
But Robert was the exec the whole time.

24
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,060
You don't deserve Robert, June.
