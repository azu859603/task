1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:13,779
What do you want, Jim?

2
00:00:13,779 --> 00:00:18,320
Some information may be of interest to you, Mr. Johnson's.

3
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,019
What kind of information do you got?

4
00:00:21,019 --> 00:00:24,019
The kind you could ruin else in Miller's perfect little life.

5
00:00:24,019 --> 00:00:27,019
You may be gave you the leverage you need to get back at Robert.

6
00:00:27,019 --> 00:00:34,490
I'm listening.

7
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:46,140
Listen up, Archer. I got some information that you might be interested in.

8
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,140
And it's got to do with you and your wife.

9
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,200
Don't worry, I'll make it easy for you, all right?

10
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,200
You give me $50 million.

11
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:57,200
And I'll make sure that having a secret stays safe with me.

12
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,799
What secret?

13
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:05,989
Have a look for yourself, but it looks like she might add a kid in college.

14
00:01:05,989 --> 00:01:11,689
I got copies of that too, so you need more.

15
00:01:11,689 --> 00:01:14,140
Think about it, buddy.

16
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:26,140
Jason, I need you to transfer $50 million into Adam Rodriguez's account.

17
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:28,140
Immediately.
