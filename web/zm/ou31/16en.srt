00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:09,619
Robert, why did you lie to me and tell me that you rented this place when you actually own it?

2
00:00:09,619 --> 00:00:21,530
Look, I'm really sorry I haven't been completely honest with you.

3
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:28,730
I originally bought the house for myself, but with you it's become a home.

4
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:31,850
A home that I want to share with you forever.

5
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:37,880
I know what to say.

6
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:45,200
I know. We've been through a lot.

7
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,969
And I'm sorry there are parts in my past that I've kept from you.

8
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:55,500
Trust me, when I say that I love you,

9
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,630
then I only love what's best for you.

10
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:09,709
I'm sorry.

11
00:01:09,709 --> 00:01:17,739
What? I thought it was all settled.

12
00:01:17,739 --> 00:01:21,849
No, I'll handle.

13
00:01:21,849 --> 00:01:24,829
What is it?

14
00:01:24,829 --> 00:01:32,700
That was Jason. There's a problem with Sarah's adoption.

15
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,700
Her faster mom doesn't want to give the approval.

16
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:38,090
What do you mean I thought everything was settled?

17
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:39,090
What are we gonna do?
