Doctor, my wife's been in a car accident, Alison Miller.

00:00:04.839 --> 00:00:05.839
Where is she?

3
00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:08.839
She's being prepped for surgery, Mr. Johnson's.

4
00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:10.839
We are our best team working on her.

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:22.320
Alison, my love.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.600
I know you can hear me.

7
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:33.049
I need you to fight and imagine my life without you.

8
00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:35.049
Well, it's this sweet.

The devoted husband keeping vigil by his wife's side.

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:41.049
Who are you?
