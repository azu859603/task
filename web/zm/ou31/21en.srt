1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240
Allison, there's something that I should have told you.

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:13,580
You did give birth, Allison, five years ago, to a baby girl.

3
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:19,839
Read a little girl?

4
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:20,839
Where is she?

5
00:00:20,839 --> 00:00:23,500
What happened to her?

6
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,309
We put her up for adoption.

7
00:00:26,309 --> 00:00:30,780
Your mom thought that it would be for the best.

8
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:33,740
You guys gave her away without telling me?

9
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:38,700
I'm going to find her.

10
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:43,259
I'm going to bring her home.

11
00:00:43,259 --> 00:00:50,899
Allison, I think that you should consider how this might affect Robert and your marriage.

12
00:00:50,899 --> 00:00:53,420
I should Robert have to bury the burden of my past.

13
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:59,109
No, it's not fair to him.

14
00:00:59,109 --> 00:01:10,069
I think we should get a divorce.

15
00:01:10,069 --> 00:01:25,790
Robert, there's something I need to tell you and it's going to change everything.

16
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:32,620
Okay, whatever it is, we'll face it together.

17
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:34,040
I love you.

18
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,040
The better what?

19
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,359
I have a daughter.

20
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:42,129
Robert, a little girl.

21
00:01:42,129 --> 00:01:47,079
But I gave birth to five years ago.
