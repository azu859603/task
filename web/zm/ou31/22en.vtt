00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:10.179
But I didn't know about her until now. My family, they gave her away without telling me.

2
00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:15.939
I'm gonna find her.

3
00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:17.940
Robert, I'm gonna bring her home.

4
00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:26.100
And if you can't handle that, then I think we should get a divorce.

5
00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:41.679
Allison, I made a vow to stand by you no matter what. If finding your daughter is what you need to do,

6
00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.229
then I'll be right by your side.

7
00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:50.189
You don't have to do that. This is just a contract marriage.

8
00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.880
I do. I see a future.

9
00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:56.859
Where we raise Sarah and your daughter together.

10
00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.020
Where we grow old side by side. I want that more than anything.
