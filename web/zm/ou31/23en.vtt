1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.009
Allison, it's so good to see you.

2
00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:13.009
Sarah and I were just having a little playtime.

3
00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:14.009
I see.

4
00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.010
That looks like you guys are having a great time.

5
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.010
You know, I was thinking.

6
00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:24.100
If you and Robert have children of your own, do you think that you still have time for Sarah?

7
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:30.449
It appears that you suffered some damage during a previous childbirth.

8
00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.060
It may make it harder for you to get pregnant again.

9
00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:41.399
Actually, Allison and I may not be able to have children of her own.

10
00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.399
What do you mean, dear?

11
00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:50.250
I've had some medical tests done and can't have other children.

12
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.250
I can't believe that you didn't tell me about this.

13
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.270
Is it true?

14
00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.270
It's okay, that's Sheila.

15
00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.689
Sarah's more than enough for us.

16
00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:11.140
Just can't believe it.

17
00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.340
You're infertile.

18
00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.180
I just can't wrap my mind around this.

19
00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.180
Robert, you've always wanted children of your own.

20
00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.590
I know I had Sheila, but he's been handling it really well.

21
00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.840
Well, that's why Robert.

22
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:41.900
Robert, about the medical report.

23
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.959
Are you really infertile?

24
00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:49.709
The doctor confirmed.

25
00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:53.900
It just seems like such a coincidence, doesn't it?

26
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:59.260
Especially when I'm dealing with my own issues.

27
00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.379
It does seem strange, right?

28
00:02:02.379 --> 00:02:08.669
A life works in mysterious ways.

29
00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:20.289
Maybe this is the universe's way of telling us that we're meant for each other.

30
00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:21.289
Yeah, you're right.

31
00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:24.180
We have each other.

32
00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.180
We have Sarah.

33
00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.009
We don't need anything else.

34
00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:48.030
I guess we should go.

35
00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.460
Come here.

36
00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:52.460
I'm the Broadway boy!

37
00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.620
Oh no!

38
00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:55.620
It's you!

39
00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.379
Okay.

40
00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:02.900
Okay.

41
00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.900
There's something special coming to favorite people.

42
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:35.370
I thought I'm so sorry, Sarah.

43
00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:36.370
I had no idea.

44
00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.370
No, it's okay, Allison.

45
00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:39.370
You couldn't have known.

46
00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.900
She's safe now.

47
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.960
You don't like mushrooms?

48
00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:46.960
Not really my favorite.

49
00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.840
Not better?

50
00:03:50.840 --> 00:04:11.550
I thought I'd see you.

51
00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:17.740
Never my biggest fan.

52
00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:20.740
But I truly believe that Robert and I were meant to be together.

53
00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:21.829
Oh, you.

54
00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:24.829
Let's cut to the chase, shall we?

55
00:04:24.829 --> 00:04:27.829
I never thought that you were right for Robert.

56
00:04:27.829 --> 00:04:29.220
Sure.

57
00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.220
He was infatuated with you once, but based on my observations,

58
00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.220
you don't have merely the amount of talent that you thought you once had.

59
00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.220
How can you say that?

60
00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.220
Robert, love me for my skills and creativity.

61
00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.220
I'm warning you, June.

62
00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:50.220
Do not mess with this marriage, especially now that Robert has found true love.

63
00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.220
You think Allison is so perfect?

64
00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.220
Well, let me tell you something, Sheila.

65
00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.220
Your precious Allison has been hiding something from all of you.

66
00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.220
What are you talking about?

67
00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.569
Allison gave birth to a child years ago before she met Robert.

68
00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:06.569
And now she's been told she can't have any more kids.

69
00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:10.920
How do you think Robert will feel when he finds out his perfect wife has been lying to him?

70
00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:28.360
It's to have children on your own and offer, Allison.

71
00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.360
You've faked that fertility test, too, didn't you?

72
00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.810
Um, Allison is my wife.

73
00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:37.810
I love her. I've made my choice.

74
00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:39.810
And Sarah is our daughter.

75
00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:40.810
That's all that matters.

76
00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:42.810
What about your future?

77
00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:45.129
What about your legacy?

78
00:05:45.129 --> 00:06:56.860
You were supposed to marry a liar, Allison.

79
00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:01.370
You were meant to be mine and then he betrayed me.

80
00:07:02.879 --> 00:07:06.230
Ran off that rich, pretty boy.

81
00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:11.319
I don't know what you're talking about. Let me go!

82
00:07:11.319 --> 00:07:18.790
Oh, not going anywhere.

83
00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:27.550
You can see him. You're gonna be my new wife.

84
00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:30.970
Jason, do something she's still not answering.

85
00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:33.129
I'll hack into the city surveillance system.

86
00:07:33.129 --> 00:07:39.740
See if I can track her movements.

87
00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:43.910
Hold on, Allison. I'm coming for you.

88
00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:46.970
You know, I've been watching you.

89
00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:52.180
Seeing you playhouse with that rich bastard.

90
00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:55.139
What made me sick?

91
00:07:55.139 --> 00:08:03.980
Wait, who are Bob Johnson, the guy who responded to my ad?

92
00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:10.759
You don't have to do this, okay?

93
00:08:10.759 --> 00:08:13.790
We can talk about it and find a solution.

94
00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:14.790
No, I don't have to.

95
00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:28.259
Allison, if I can't have you, I don't think anybody can.

96
00:08:28.259 --> 00:08:32.500
Boss, I've got a name.

97
00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:35.940
The man who took Allison, it's Bob Johnson.

98
00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:36.940
Bob Johnson?

99
00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:40.070
That's the guy Allison was supposed to marry from where I had.

100
00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:53.860
You're so beautiful for this school.

101
00:08:53.860 --> 00:09:02.500
And now, I'm gonna make you mine.

102
00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:08.860
No, please don't! Please!

103
00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:14.450
Please don't!

104
00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:59.529
Allison, it's okay. I'm here. I'm here.

105
00:09:59.529 --> 00:10:00.690
You're safe now.

106
00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:22.679
This place.

107
00:10:22.679 --> 00:10:28.870
This is my home.

108
00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:39.059
I'm sorry, I don't understand. I thought you were just an employee.

109
00:10:39.059 --> 00:10:42.059
Yeah, I need to tell you the truth.

110
00:10:42.059 --> 00:10:46.019
I'm not an employee at MJ Group.

111
00:10:46.019 --> 00:10:48.419
I'm the CEO.

112
00:10:48.419 --> 00:10:57.220
Wait till you've been lying to me this whole time?

113
00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:02.419
Allison, when I first saw you at the coffee shop, I was captivated.

114
00:11:02.419 --> 00:11:10.559
You were so beautiful, so special, I fell for you instantly.

115
00:11:10.559 --> 00:11:16.620
I wanted to tell you sooner I did, but you sat down before and the chance.

116
00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:19.620
Why didn't you just trust me enough to tell me the truth?

117
00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:27.279
Because I was afraid. I know, and I should have told you sooner, and I am sorry for that.

118
00:11:27.279 --> 00:11:31.429
I just wanted you to love me for who I am.

119
00:11:31.429 --> 00:11:40.629
Ronford, I love you for your heart, not your bank account, okay?

120
00:11:40.629 --> 00:11:45.980
You should have known that I love you for everything that you are.

121
00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:49.039
You're never gonna lose me, okay?

122
00:11:49.039 --> 00:12:01.549
Allison, I am so happy that you're safe.

123
00:12:01.549 --> 00:12:03.549
She loves you, I'm so happy you're here.

124
00:12:03.549 --> 00:12:05.809
Yeah, a couple of the things.

125
00:12:05.809 --> 00:12:14.950
Sheila is my mom, not my aunt, and Peter is my brother.

126
00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:20.019
Well, I am so happy to meet you guys as Robert's family.

127
00:12:20.019 --> 00:12:29.750
Allison, I realize that you've been through a lot.

128
00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:36.120
We need to have a conversation about MJ Group.

129
00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:42.120
With a company this large, it is essential that we have an anger.

130
00:12:42.120 --> 00:13:01.669
Robert, if you continue to prioritize this marriage over your family, I simply cannot support it.

131
00:13:01.669 --> 00:13:06.750
I cannot accept Allison as your wife.

132
00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:16.019
Look, I understand where she's coming from.

133
00:13:16.019 --> 00:13:20.049
I mean, she just wants what's best for you and the company.

134
00:13:20.049 --> 00:13:33.940
Peter, I need you to start preparing to take over as the heir of the MJ Group.

135
00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:39.710
What? Are you seriously giving up your birthright? Your legacy?

136
00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:46.539
For Allison, she means everything to me. I won't want anything come between us, not even the company.

137
00:13:46.539 --> 00:13:51.470
I hope you know what you're doing, brother. This is a huge sacrifice.

138
00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:56.899
I'm gonna have so much fun today.

139
00:13:56.899 --> 00:14:00.149
Allison, come here, I want to show you something.

140
00:14:00.149 --> 00:14:09.860
Okay, how much you go play outside and I'll go meet in a second. Okay, have fun.

141
00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:14.860
Robert always had such a strange heart, even as a little boy.

142
00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:23.350
But the wife of a wealthy CEO is not an easy path.

143
00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:27.720
I want to give you something.

144
00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:35.360
This was handed down through generations of Johnson's women.

145
00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:51.460
Allison, if you truly love him, you might need to think about letting him go,

146
00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:56.100
so he could fulfill his destiny to the MJ Group.

147
00:14:56.100 --> 00:15:29.259
It's all in here, Peter. Transfer power, corporate structure.

148
00:15:29.259 --> 00:15:33.830
You're officially the heir of the MJ Group. Are you sure about this, Robert?

149
00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:36.830
Once done, there's no going back. I've never been more sure of anything.

150
00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:39.059
Allison is my life.

151
00:15:39.059 --> 00:15:45.450
Robert, what have you done?

152
00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:50.990
Allison has already agreed to leave you, so you could fulfill your destiny.

153
00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:53.379
What?

154
00:15:53.379 --> 00:15:55.570
She can't... I have to fight her.

155
00:15:55.570 --> 00:15:57.570
No, Robert. Robert!

156
00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:10.029
Allison?

157
00:16:10.029 --> 00:16:11.029
Are you sick?

158
00:16:11.029 --> 00:16:36.519
Here, this will settle your stomach.

159
00:16:36.519 --> 00:16:37.519
I can't do this.

160
00:16:37.519 --> 00:16:44.490
I can't be the reason that you give up everything.

161
00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:46.490
Promise me what to do, okay?

162
00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:51.120
Promise me that you'll let me keep Sarah, okay?

163
00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:55.019
And you can still have children with someone else.

164
00:16:55.019 --> 00:16:56.980
This.

165
00:16:56.980 --> 00:17:02.059
Allison, can you imagine my life without you?

166
00:17:02.059 --> 00:17:06.369
I love you more than anything.

167
00:17:06.369 --> 00:17:08.369
But I can not be a burden to you.

168
00:17:08.369 --> 00:17:17.630
Longs to you and your family.

169
00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:34.579
It's better this way.

170
00:17:34.579 --> 00:17:39.289
So we can't see the pain.

171
00:17:39.289 --> 00:18:16.779
I'm the person of love.

172
00:18:16.779 --> 00:18:17.779
Who's my reservation?

173
00:18:17.779 --> 00:18:24.809
I guess that's what happens when you cross the future, so you use life.

174
00:18:24.809 --> 00:18:27.809
You should have known better than the WAP against June.

175
00:18:27.809 --> 00:18:37.339
I will pack my things and be up by the end of the day.

176
00:18:37.339 --> 00:18:44.750
Mom, I know you care about the company.

177
00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:49.170
But can't you see how I love Robert and Allison are with each other?

178
00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:50.259
Is that what you can first?

179
00:18:50.259 --> 00:18:52.259
I don't know what to do.

180
00:18:52.259 --> 00:18:53.259
Right?

181
00:18:53.259 --> 00:18:55.259
I want Robert to be happy.

182
00:18:55.259 --> 00:18:56.259
I do.

183
00:18:56.259 --> 00:19:05.259
But I also want to ensure that the future are finishing.

184
00:19:05.259 --> 00:19:07.380
Not so fast, Allison.

185
00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:09.380
I know what you're trying to do.

186
00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:10.380
What are you talking about?

187
00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:13.380
We just walk out of here with company property.

188
00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:18.490
I won't let you get away with it.

189
00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:19.490
Company property?

190
00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:22.490
No, I haven't taken anything that is in my own, but you have.

191
00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:25.490
And until you return what you stole, you're not going anywhere.

192
00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:42.759
Listen, she stole from our client.

193
00:19:42.759 --> 00:19:43.759
Adam Rodriguez.

194
00:19:43.759 --> 00:19:47.400
No, Adam gave that to me for his bad behavior.

195
00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:49.400
Like, I didn't steal it, I promise.

196
00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:51.400
She's just trying to cover her tracks.

197
00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:53.400
Once a thief, always a thief.

198
00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:54.660
We can't trust her.

199
00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:56.660
She's probably been stealing all along.

200
00:19:56.660 --> 00:20:06.599
Little Miss Allison caught stealing red-handed.

201
00:20:06.599 --> 00:20:09.019
Can't say I'm surprised.

202
00:20:09.019 --> 00:20:12.359
Jason.

203
00:20:12.359 --> 00:20:14.390
Perfect timing.

204
00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:17.390
Allison has just been caught stealing from our client.

205
00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:20.390
I trust that you'll hinder this matter appropriately.

206
00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:21.680
Actually, Jim.

207
00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:23.680
This is all a big misunderstanding.

208
00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:25.680
Mad evidence to prove it.

209
00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:31.309
These are designs created by Allison, David seven years ago.

210
00:20:31.309 --> 00:20:37.180
And these are the designs Jim submitted as her own six years ago.

211
00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:39.519
That is absurd.

212
00:20:39.519 --> 00:20:41.519
Allison must have stolen them from me.

213
00:20:41.519 --> 00:20:42.519
They still lied, Jim.

214
00:20:42.519 --> 00:20:43.519
No, but Allison does lie.

215
00:20:43.519 --> 00:20:45.519
Allison's designs predate yours.

216
00:20:45.519 --> 00:20:47.519
It's clear that you're the one who's been stealing.

217
00:20:47.519 --> 00:20:48.519
Not her.

218
00:20:48.519 --> 00:20:49.519
This is ridiculous, Jason.

219
00:20:49.519 --> 00:20:52.519
What I am the CEO of is what you will pay for your insolence.

220
00:20:52.519 --> 00:20:54.519
I'm afraid they'll be happening, Jim.

221
00:20:54.519 --> 00:21:06.789
I'm actually glad each of you are here,

222
00:21:06.789 --> 00:21:08.819
because I have an important announcement to make.

223
00:21:08.819 --> 00:21:11.690
Allison and I are married.

224
00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:13.069
She's my wife.

225
00:21:13.069 --> 00:21:16.069
In the future of MJ Group.

226
00:21:16.069 --> 00:21:20.859
Robert, how could she go back to what I loved you?

227
00:21:20.859 --> 00:21:24.259
You want to talk to me about cruelty, Jim?

228
00:21:24.259 --> 00:21:28.000
You don't know what cruelty truly is.

229
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:34.450
She deserved it.

230
00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:35.450
And you, Adam.

231
00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:37.900
Don't think you're getting off so easy.

232
00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:44.569
And you, Adam.

233
00:21:44.569 --> 00:21:47.019
Don't think you're getting off so easy.

234
00:21:47.019 --> 00:21:49.079
What are you talking about?

235
00:21:49.079 --> 00:21:51.079
The $50 million you extorted from me.

236
00:21:51.079 --> 00:21:53.079
Did you really think you'd get away from it?

237
00:21:53.079 --> 00:21:55.500
Blackmail and extortion are serious crimes.

238
00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:58.170
You'll be in prison for a long time.

239
00:21:58.170 --> 00:22:00.170
I'd like to see you try.

240
00:22:00.170 --> 00:22:03.339
Please.

241
00:22:03.339 --> 00:22:06.339
Adam Rodriguez and June Davis, you're under arrest for attempted murder,

242
00:22:06.339 --> 00:22:08.339
blackmail, and extortion.

243
00:22:08.339 --> 00:22:11.420
Bird.

244
00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:14.900
This is ridiculous.

245
00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:18.849
You ruined everything.

246
00:22:18.849 --> 00:22:27.180
Little...

247
00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:40.180
Some will call an ambulance.

248
00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:45.289
Big, what happened?

249
00:22:45.289 --> 00:22:46.289
You fell, dear.

250
00:22:46.289 --> 00:22:53.309
You're going to be okay.

251
00:22:53.309 --> 00:22:55.309
Mrs. Johnson, is you awake?

252
00:22:55.309 --> 00:22:57.309
I have some wonderful news for you.

253
00:22:57.309 --> 00:22:58.410
Congratulations.

254
00:22:58.410 --> 00:23:01.720
You're pregnant.

255
00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:04.700
I'm pregnant.

256
00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:06.700
I'm gonna have a baby?

257
00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:08.500
Uh-huh.

258
00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:10.500
This is amazing.

259
00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:13.700
I can't believe it.

260
00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:15.700
Alison, are you okay?

261
00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:17.700
It makes it something about a growth.

262
00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:21.269
A growth, yes.

263
00:23:21.269 --> 00:23:23.269
But not the kind you're thinking of, Robert.

264
00:23:23.269 --> 00:23:31.980
I'm pregnant.

265
00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:37.019
I'm gonna have a baby.

266
00:23:37.019 --> 00:23:38.339
Uh-huh.

267
00:23:38.339 --> 00:23:39.339
Our baby.

268
00:23:39.339 --> 00:23:46.039
I love you so much.

269
00:23:46.039 --> 00:23:55.150
You make me the happiest man in the world.

270
00:23:55.150 --> 00:24:00.569
Hi.

271
00:24:00.569 --> 00:24:02.589
Everyone.

272
00:24:02.589 --> 00:24:04.589
Alison and I have some incredible news.

273
00:24:04.589 --> 00:24:08.740
We're spacing a baby.

274
00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:10.740
Oh, what?

275
00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:11.740
Really?

276
00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:12.740
Yeah.

277
00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:14.740
Oh, what a beautiful girl.

278
00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:15.740
Here.

279
00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:17.859
Alison, it's Sarah.

280
00:24:17.859 --> 00:24:20.059
There's been an accident at the daycare.

281
00:24:20.059 --> 00:24:21.059
What?

282
00:24:21.059 --> 00:24:22.059
What happened?

283
00:24:22.059 --> 00:24:23.059
Is she gonna be okay?

284
00:24:23.059 --> 00:24:25.059
She's in a medical condition.

285
00:24:25.059 --> 00:24:27.059
It needs an immediate blood transfusion.

286
00:24:27.059 --> 00:24:29.309
But a blood type is RH negative.

287
00:24:29.309 --> 00:24:32.880
The hospital's struggling to find a match.

288
00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:34.579
I'm RH negative.

289
00:24:34.579 --> 00:24:36.160
I can donate the blood.

290
00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:42.160
It's gonna go wide right now.

291
00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:45.420
Mr. Johnson's, according to the test results,

292
00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:50.400
you're not just a match for Sarah.

293
00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:52.400
You're a direct relative.

294
00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:54.299
What?

295
00:24:54.299 --> 00:25:05.740
Robert, is everything okay?

296
00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:08.180
Is everything okay with Sarah?

297
00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:09.630
Can we talk?

298
00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:12.779
Yeah.

299
00:25:12.779 --> 00:25:16.900
There's something I need to tell you.

300
00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:19.930
About five years ago, the Crown Hotel,

301
00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:25.930
slept with someone I didn't know.

302
00:25:25.930 --> 00:25:30.210
Five years ago, Celina can't remember.

303
00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:34.420
Do you think it's possible that we...

304
00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:37.289
There's only one way to find out.

305
00:25:37.289 --> 00:25:50.519
I don't know how to explain this,

306
00:25:50.519 --> 00:25:53.519
but Mrs. Johnson's, you're the biological mother.

307
00:25:53.519 --> 00:26:00.980
Good.

308
00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:03.559
Sarah's her daughter.

309
00:26:03.559 --> 00:26:08.789
Pumped at her own child.

310
00:26:08.789 --> 00:26:11.140
At this time, she was ours.

311
00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:24.119
A piece of us.

312
00:26:24.119 --> 00:26:25.119
Hey, Alison.

313
00:26:25.119 --> 00:26:28.720
My love.

314
00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:31.910
Even though our journey started by chance,

315
00:26:31.910 --> 00:26:33.910
with everything we've been through,

316
00:26:33.910 --> 00:26:36.940
I know we're meant to be.

317
00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:39.940
You've loved me unconditionally,

318
00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:42.609
even when I didn't deserve it.

319
00:26:42.609 --> 00:26:46.700
And now I'm gonna ask you,

320
00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:48.910
my story.

321
00:26:48.910 --> 00:26:52.599
Alison Miller,

322
00:26:52.599 --> 00:26:55.599
will you do me the honor of becoming my wife?

323
00:26:55.599 --> 00:26:58.940
Yes, yes, a thousand times.

324
00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:01.940
Mommy and Dad are getting married again.

325
00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:03.940
That's right, Princess.

326
00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:05.940
This time, that's right.
