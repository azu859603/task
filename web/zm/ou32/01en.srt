00:00:02,509 --> 00:00:09,050
My name is Hermione daughter of the richest man in the southern region. I go by tea and hold a PhD in computer science

2
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:15,230
Three years ago. I fell in love with Chris at a party since then I've hidden my identity and become his executive assistant

3
00:00:15,689 --> 00:00:20,949
Secretly dating him so you have a board meeting at 10 meeting with that Middle Eastern oil tycoon at 11 and an online conference

4
00:00:20,949 --> 00:00:26,980
The international business division from two to six then eight eight what eight you?

5
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,660
Have a date the executive assistant

6
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:34,030
sounds good

7
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:39,189
Plus we've got a problem. There's a massive group of hackers attacking our service the entire tech team is under water

8
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,219
Okay

9
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:44,409
New plan cancel all of my meetings for the rest of the day

10
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:53,439
Except for the last one if possible that man

11
00:00:54,979 --> 00:00:57,219
Still as irresistible as the day and met him

12
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,109
LM is under attack

13
00:01:05,109 --> 00:01:10,150
Now I need answers so who's causing it and how are we going to fix it?

14
00:01:10,629 --> 00:01:17,409
The main issue is that LM dominated the southeast market last year

15
00:01:17,409 --> 00:01:24,810
So as a result we accumulate many enemies and we just cannot identify it. Okay. I need answers

16
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:32,370
All we know is that over 300 hackers are attacking our firewall simultaneously

17
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:36,609
They are about to bridge our firewall. If that firewall is British, Ellen is finished. No

18
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:39,010
No, no, what is happening?

19
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:44,769
Our computers are hijacked. Why isn't responding either? Same here. Nothing's working

20
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:47,890
Boss we are out of options

21
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:53,969
You all are LM's top talent

22
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:58,810
You have graduated from the most elite universities. Is this how you're gonna handle conflict?

23
00:02:01,299 --> 00:02:03,939
Only we were as good as dr. Quinton dr. Quinton

24
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:12,400
Didn't you study under him only tea dr. Quinton's favorite ever matches level, but tea has been missing for three years

25
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:16,550
Ellen is facing a huge crisis

26
00:02:17,189 --> 00:02:20,150
aren't they just for sure ruin if I don't reveal that I'm tea, but

27
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:23,259
Will it change everything between us?
