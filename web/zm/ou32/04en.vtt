We agreed to keep your identity hidden to win over Chris, but he's engaged now Hermione. That means your search for love has failed

2
00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:15.779
It's over. Come home. Raise your child and leave him behind. I really do this alone

3
00:00:16.739 --> 00:00:18.739
Hey, stop right there

4
00:00:20.899 --> 00:00:25.899
Miss Brown. Oh, so you know who I am. I've yeah, I've seen on the news

5
00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.440
Good, so then you know I'm about to be Mrs. Evans

6
00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:39.159
So you're working closest with him. Here's your warning

7
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:47.369
Stop parading around in skirts like that or you'll be fired fired

8
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.240
You don't have the power to do that

9
00:00:52.840 --> 00:01:00.560
Not yet. Anyway, you're still just a fiance. Let me see. Let's not get out of ourselves. I know how you got this job

10
00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:03.399
You think I don't know you're sleeping with him

11
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.909
So you want tips for your wedding night?

12
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.400
You bitch that's enough
