00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Chris. Perfect timing. Your assistant here was getting a little difficult, so I was just helping her find her place.

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.880
Training my assistant. It's not your job.

3
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.640
But, I...

4
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.640
John, please take Lucy to the tech department.

5
00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.640
Miss Brown. This way, please.

6
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.859
Talk about this later.

7
00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:58.380
What's the matter, fiance not doing it for you?

8
00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.700
Should I get your lesson on your end, preferences?

9
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.099
Yeah. If you even know my preferences.

10
00:01:06.099 --> 00:01:16.299
Enough. I handed in my resignation. We're done. Chris. We're engaged.

11
00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:19.420
Listen. You of all people know that that is not romantic.

12
00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.420
Okay, our family have been friends for many generations, and since the Brown family stock is sinking,

13
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.420
and their projects are failing, and now that I found out that Lucy is the one that helped stop the hackers yesterday.

14
00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.420
Will Lucy is the one that helped stop the hackers?

15
00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.620
Yes. And I also found out that she is Dr. T.

16
00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.620
Which now makes her the technical supervisor of this company.
