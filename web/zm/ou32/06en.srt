1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,480
You think Lucy is Dr. T?

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:10,490
Yes.

3
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:19,379
She's not. She's lying to you.

4
00:00:19,379 --> 00:00:21,379
Mother, what are you doing here?

5
00:00:21,379 --> 00:00:26,379
If I hadn't come, Lucy's reputation would have been ruined by now.

6
00:00:26,379 --> 00:00:33,700
Miss Evans, I think you owe me an apology.

7
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,700
Apology? Who do you think you are slandering Lucy like that?

8
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,700
You're what? A glorified secretary?

9
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,299
Does she help?

10
00:00:43,299 --> 00:00:45,299
It's not slander?

11
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:48,780
If it's true, Lucy's not Dr. T.

12
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,780
Lucy is a student of Quentin's.

13
00:00:51,780 --> 00:01:00,200
This is the full authorization of the defense system, signed by Dr. T herself.

14
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:05,200
Spread more lies like that, and I will rip that slut mouth right off your face.

15
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,200
Please don't be mad, Mrs. Evans.

16
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,000
I tried so hard to keep a low profile, it's only natural should have doubts.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,159
That gave my authorization to the Brown family.

18
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:18,450
This really mess things up for me.

19
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:23,819
Chris, have to believe me. She's not Dr. T.

20
00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:33,079
Why would I?

21
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:36,079
Because I am Dr. T.
