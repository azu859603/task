1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
A girl from the slums claiming to be Dr. T.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:08,800
Chris, get this liar out of here now!

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,910
I'm ready, please, don't speak like that in the office.

4
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:16,129
You don't believe me?

5
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:17,530
Seriously?

6
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:22,420
Without evidence, it can be interpreted as slender.

7
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:26,070
Fine.

8
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,170
I'll prove it.

9
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:38,929
Now that the crisis is over, I'm withdrawing my authorization from the Browns.

10
00:00:38,929 --> 00:00:41,390
I won't let Lucy impersonate me anymore.

11
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:47,619
So she's the real T.

12
00:00:48,369 --> 00:00:52,090
If Chris finds out, he'll back out of the engagement.

13
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:55,380
Anyone in my way has got to go.

14
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:58,340
Lucy, where are you?

15
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:10,150
Oh, I know you're there.

16
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:12,010
Miss...

17
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:14,900
Keep your voice down.

18
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,900
Why are you following me?

19
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:19,700
The big boss then has to protect the little boss.

20
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:24,900
What? Little...

21
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:30,549
He doesn't need your protection either.

22
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:33,349
Stop sending people to follow me, or I'm just never going to come home again.

23
00:01:33,349 --> 00:01:39,989
How about that?

24
00:01:39,989 --> 00:01:41,670
Yes, sir.

25
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:49,030
Copy that, sir.

26
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:50,030
Much better.

27
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:55,260
I said...
