1
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:05,870
Well, well, well, the real Dr. T.

2
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:08,480
What a surprise.

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,310
What do you want?

4
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:15,310
The only one who knew what Dr. T looked like was Dr. Quentin.

5
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:17,379
And he's dead.

6
00:00:17,379 --> 00:00:21,379
So, with authorization in my hands, if you disappear.

7
00:00:21,379 --> 00:00:22,379
Disappear.

8
00:00:22,379 --> 00:00:25,559
Are you crazy?

9
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:27,559
Aren't you worried about getting arrested?

10
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:30,559
What about if Chris finds out the truth?

11
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:32,560
The truth is whatever people believe.

12
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:37,820
Do you know why the Brown family became lifelong friends

13
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,820
with the Evans family?

14
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:42,820
Because I saved Mrs. Evans' life in a robbery.

15
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:46,070
Ever since then, she's been trying to get Chris to marry me.

16
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:48,070
No, we said no.

17
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:51,070
Until yesterday, I became Dr. T.

18
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:53,840
Finally got him.

19
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,259
But you?

20
00:00:56,259 --> 00:00:58,899
You're in my way.

21
00:00:58,899 --> 00:01:01,899
Why couldn't you just stay his assistant?

22
00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:05,280
Let's talk about this.

23
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,280
Just put the gun down.

24
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,280
I'll tell Chris that you're the real Dr. T.

25
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,569
Too late.

26
00:01:11,569 --> 00:01:13,569
The dead tells no tears.
