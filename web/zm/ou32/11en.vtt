1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.600
Her number's been deactivated.

2
00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:13.060
It's not in service.

3
00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:14.859
Time to go to her place.

4
00:00:14.859 --> 00:00:16.260
The board meeting's in 10 minutes.

5
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:25.199
The board meeting can't wait.

6
00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.550
You didn't even move down.

7
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.739
Yep.

8
00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:32.740
Everything's gone.

9
00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.329
Like, she was never even on.

10
00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.100
Listen.

11
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.100
I don't care what you have to do.

12
00:00:41.100 --> 00:01:01.369
Find her.

13
00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:02.570
She was pregnant.

14
00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:35.180
Oh, my dear.

15
00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:38.930
My dear.

16
00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.069
Oh, I missed you too.

17
00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:43.700
Three years.

18
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.620
Oh, because of that silly boy at the banquet.

19
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.859
That doesn't matter right now.

20
00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:50.260
You're finally home.

21
00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.450
I was wrong.

22
00:01:53.450 --> 00:02:04.579
Is my baby okay?

23
00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:10.060
Is my baby okay?

24
00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.939
Honestly, if you lost a baby, it wouldn't be the worst thing.

25
00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:15.740
Give you a break from that idiot.

26
00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.539
Daniel, stop your nonsense.

27
00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:20.939
This child is part of the Garcia family.

28
00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:22.539
Don't worry, sweetheart.

29
00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:28.710
The baby is fine.

30
00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.860
But you need to rest for the next two months.

31
00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.909
Your body's not in a good condition right now.

32
00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:43.189
Your birthday is two months away.

33
00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:46.449
And I've asked Daniel to plan a party.

34
00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:48.449
You've been out of the spotlight way too long.

35
00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:51.509
It's time to show off my brilliant daughter.

36
00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:53.509
Let me be a proud pom-pom-pom.

37
00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:55.930
I love you, Dad.

38
00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.719
Oh, do you remember Henry?

39
00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:03.780
You two used to play together all the time when you were kids.

40
00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:04.780
Mm-hmm.

41
00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.780
Well, I just heard he's single and ready to mingle.

42
00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:09.979
Mm-hmm.

43
00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:11.979
Maybe you should catch up.

44
00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:12.979
Seriously?

45
00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:15.979
Do I look like I'm in the mood to date right now?

46
00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:18.039
Who said anything about dating?

47
00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:19.039
Just a chair.

48
00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:28.439
Mr. Evans, there's a shareholder meeting.

49
00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:30.439
A 10 meeting with that Middle Eastern oil tycoon at 11,

50
00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:32.439
and an online conference at the International Business Division

51
00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:34.439
from two to six, then at eight.

52
00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:40.979
Then at two, there's, um, uh, sorry.

53
00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:42.979
Let me just look at my notes.

54
00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:48.750
You're fired because my last executive assistant never had to

55
00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.750
check her notes, so please take your ass out of my office

56
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.750
and leave now.

57
00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:05.689
Oh, you're here.

58
00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:07.199
Did you find her?

59
00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:11.509
I checked the one who looked like her in Shanghai.

60
00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:14.689
What was that?

61
00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:16.750
We're gonna search him for two months.

62
00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:17.750
All over the world.

63
00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.750
Send people to 40 different countries,

64
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.060
but we're worth half a million, and nothing.

65
00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.060
What are you trying to say?

66
00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.060
Maybe...

67
00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.339
Maybe it's time to stop.

68
00:04:30.339 --> 00:04:32.339
Okay, let me tell you something.

69
00:04:32.339 --> 00:04:35.339
I'm going to find this girl, whether it takes two years

70
00:04:35.339 --> 00:04:36.339
or $20 million.

71
00:04:36.339 --> 00:04:38.339
Now, if you are not up for the job,

72
00:04:38.339 --> 00:04:41.339
you can go out of my office down the hall to HR

73
00:04:41.339 --> 00:04:44.339
and I can find somebody else that can take care of the job.

74
00:04:44.339 --> 00:04:46.339
No, no, no, no.

75
00:04:46.339 --> 00:04:53.079
I'm staying.

76
00:04:53.079 --> 00:04:56.720
Mrs. Garcia, you've invited you to a birthday party.

77
00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.319
Use the invitation.

78
00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:01.319
Get a gift and go yourself.

79
00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:02.699
Understood.

80
00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:21.600
How long is it?

81
00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.949
Henry, what are you doing here?

82
00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:26.949
I just came to check up on you.

83
00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:27.949
Wanna see how you were doing?

84
00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:30.949
Well, you've seen me.

85
00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:34.269
Come on, don't be so distant.

86
00:05:34.269 --> 00:05:36.269
Yo, I need a favor.

87
00:05:36.269 --> 00:05:39.370
My dad wants me to date the Garcia daughter.

88
00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:40.370
Not my problem.

89
00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:42.750
Oh, come on, man.

90
00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:45.750
Listen, I know you're looking for somebody.

91
00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:49.750
You help me out, and I'll get my media people on it for you.

92
00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:56.370
Okay, what are you looking for?

93
00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.370
Great. Got your attention.

94
00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:02.370
So, this Garcia girl's birthday is in two days.

95
00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.370
I'm supposed to meet up with her before the party,

96
00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:06.370
and all I need you to do is show up for five minutes

97
00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:08.660
and pretend to be my boyfriend.

98
00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:09.660
Let me think about it.

99
00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:10.660
No.

100
00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:12.660
Come on, or just say that I stole your girl,

101
00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:14.660
and I'm a jerk or whatever, dude. Just come on.

102
00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:15.660
Help her, brother.

103
00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:16.660
Oh.

104
00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:22.600
Well, if you're so against it, why even go?

105
00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.600
My dad wants to get into the AI field.

106
00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.240
She's an expert.

107
00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.240
Plus, our family's kind of going way back together

108
00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.240
so it's a perfect match.

109
00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:36.240
But, dude, you do not understand how terrifying this girl is.

110
00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.240
I mean, she's like Frankenstein from the movies.

111
00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:44.430
You know, messy hair, thick glasses, spewing random math phrases.

112
00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:48.430
Wait, the transfer vehicle of things into the Earth's orbit is escaping.

113
00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:53.430
Escaping gravitational quality Earth and getting going into this transfer orbit.

114
00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:54.430
Are you with me?

115
00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:57.430
I couldn't understand a word that she was saying, dude.

116
00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:00.819
Mary, her? No, thank you.

117
00:07:00.819 --> 00:07:04.819
Okay, so if a nerdy girl can fill that empty head of yours,

118
00:07:04.819 --> 00:07:10.060
fine. I will go to the party.

119
00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:15.860
Let's go.

120
00:07:15.860 --> 00:08:26.610
The gosh, her daughter's never been seen in public.

121
00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:28.610
I wonder what she looks like.

122
00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:30.610
I bet she's hungry.

123
00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:33.610
Why also the Garcia store a big event if not to announce that she's single?

124
00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:34.610
It doesn't matter.

125
00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:36.610
Marrying into the gosh, her family.

126
00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:38.610
I'd do it even though she looks like Castimoto.

127
00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:40.610
See, that's what my dad thinks.

128
00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:42.610
I want you in the Garcia family, it doesn't matter.

129
00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:43.990
Whoops.

130
00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:44.990
What, I'm telling you, bro?

131
00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:45.990
It does.

132
00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:47.990
I need a drink.

133
00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:55.200
Bring me to her.

134
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.870
Party's about to start.

135
00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:57.870
Where are you going?

136
00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:01.309
We found her.

137
00:09:01.309 --> 00:09:03.309
Great, I just lost my leverage.

138
00:09:03.309 --> 00:09:04.600
Hurry back.

139
00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:11.710
What's that?

140
00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:13.539
Honey?

141
00:09:13.539 --> 00:09:40.179
No, it's me.

142
00:09:40.179 --> 00:09:41.590
I'm Riny.

143
00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:42.590
Mine.

144
00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:45.259
He's not Chris's billionaire friend.

145
00:09:45.259 --> 00:09:47.360
How does he know Hermione?

146
00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:49.360
I knew it.

147
00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:52.389
She used Chris to climb the social ladder.

148
00:09:52.389 --> 00:09:55.389
Got into the world of eligible bachelors.

149
00:09:55.389 --> 00:09:58.490
Shameless gold digger.

150
00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:00.320
Garcia?

151
00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.350
Yeah.

152
00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:02.350
You and Hermione Garcia.

153
00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:03.350
Wow.

154
00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:07.629
Why don't you wish me a happy birthday?

155
00:10:07.629 --> 00:10:08.629
Of course.

156
00:10:08.629 --> 00:10:19.779
I finally found you.

157
00:10:19.779 --> 00:10:27.120
Who is this?

158
00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:29.340
Oh, that's really rich of you.

159
00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:33.629
You think I should let him know your preference is?

160
00:10:33.629 --> 00:10:39.350
Chris, you might have grabbed me for a minute.

161
00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:47.500
I told you to sabotage my date.

162
00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:48.500
Not steal her.

163
00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:49.500
Steal her.

164
00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:50.500
Hmm, that's funny.

165
00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:51.500
No, Chris.

166
00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:52.500
This is off.

167
00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:53.500
Just stop.

168
00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:54.500
She's me now.

169
00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:55.500
She's my date.

170
00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:56.500
I can just say to you anymore, buddy.

171
00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:57.500
Move.

172
00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:03.940
Hermione, you couldn't possibly have gone an invitation to an event of this caliber.

173
00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:06.940
I suggest you leave before security finds you.

174
00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:07.940
Yeah, you're right.

175
00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:08.940
I don't have an invitation.

176
00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:11.940
But I am still here for the party.

177
00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:19.590
This is an exclusive party for the Garcia family heiress.

178
00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:24.720
I suggest you leave before you embarrass yourself.

179
00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:25.720
Interesting.

180
00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:29.750
I thought she was a big deal, but she's just a secretary.

181
00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:30.750
Really?

182
00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:34.750
I mean, look at her neck like those are Marie and Lynette Saffires.

183
00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:37.750
And she's wearing 110 carat diamond bracelet.

184
00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:41.750
And she's one of Billions, little Billions on her.

185
00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:42.750
Let's just get a sugar daddy.

186
00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:43.750
Wow.

187
00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:44.750
You know what?

188
00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:45.750
You.

189
00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:46.750
You have a real talent.

190
00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:47.750
Just a couple sentences for you.

191
00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:50.750
And suddenly, I am the gold-digging whore in the room.

192
00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:53.750
I can't even imagine what I'd be branded as if you keep talking.

193
00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:58.940
Look, even if you are the real tea, not really matters.

194
00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:00.940
You have no power, no connections.

195
00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:05.740
I can bring you down as easy as stepping on a bug.

196
00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:08.440
Is it?

197
00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:15.750
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you all for coming out to help celebrate my daughter's birthday.

198
00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:20.750
Tonight, I am proud to introduce my daughter to all of you.

199
00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:22.750
Then share with Mrs. Goshos here.

200
00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:25.940
For the very first time.

201
00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:31.120
Why is he looking at me like that?

202
00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:32.500
Wait.

203
00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:34.500
Is Paul Garcia my mom's ex?

204
00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:36.500
My little princess.

205
00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:38.659
Please.

206
00:12:38.659 --> 00:12:40.370
Come on up.

207
00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:51.360
Jesus, you're almost just a secretary.

208
00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:53.360
How can you be the Goshor Eris?

209
00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:55.360
No sugar daddy would give out Billions like that.

210
00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:57.360
Only a father would.

211
00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:59.360
Lucy almost killed us.

212
00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:02.360
We almost insulted the Goshor family, man.

213
00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:04.360
It's best we steer clear from you from now.

214
00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:08.649
Mr. Garcia, your gift for the lady of the hour.

215
00:13:08.649 --> 00:13:12.659
Thank you, Rupert.

216
00:13:12.659 --> 00:13:15.200
Daddy, you didn't have to.

217
00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:17.200
Of course I have to.

218
00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:21.409
How could this be?

219
00:13:21.409 --> 00:13:29.070
I thought this whole time that I didn't know who she was, but she was just lying to me about her identity.

220
00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:30.460
Thank you.

221
00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:33.000
Bruh, smart fiance.

222
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
Happy birthday, darling.

223
00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.000
No.

224
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.220
It is not your fancy that is your blind date that you fucked up with.

225
00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:41.220
What are you talking about?

226
00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:43.289
She called me darling.

227
00:13:43.289 --> 00:13:44.289
She obviously likes me.

228
00:13:44.289 --> 00:13:57.899
Shouldn't you be taking care of your pregnant fiance?

229
00:13:57.899 --> 00:14:00.799
What are you doing here?

230
00:14:00.799 --> 00:14:05.820
My pregnant fiance is standing right in front of me.

231
00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:07.269
That's why I came.

232
00:14:07.269 --> 00:14:14.740
There was a baby here once.

233
00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:23.370
Your fiance fired?

234
00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:31.059
But why would you care?

235
00:14:31.059 --> 00:14:32.059
You have another one.

236
00:14:32.059 --> 00:14:35.259
My baby never meant anything to you.

237
00:14:35.259 --> 00:14:38.940
I'm sorry.

238
00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:40.519
But I never knew anything.

239
00:14:40.519 --> 00:14:41.519
Oh, you didn't know?

240
00:14:41.519 --> 00:14:43.519
I didn't know that I was the Garcia family Eris.

241
00:14:43.519 --> 00:14:46.519
So you chose the more valuable one, Dr. T.

242
00:14:46.519 --> 00:14:50.519
Or you didn't know that I was also pregnant, like your fiance.

243
00:14:50.519 --> 00:14:51.519
Let me guess.

244
00:14:51.519 --> 00:14:52.519
Let me guess.

245
00:14:52.519 --> 00:14:54.519
You're going to say that she didn't get pregnant right after you got engaged?

246
00:14:54.519 --> 00:14:55.519
No.

247
00:14:55.519 --> 00:14:58.519
I'm so thankful that I never told you about who I am.

248
00:14:58.519 --> 00:15:02.519
Otherwise, I never would have found out just how little you deserve my love.

249
00:15:02.519 --> 00:15:05.740
Wait, let me just talk to you for one second.

250
00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:06.740
She was never.

251
00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:08.059
Of course.

252
00:15:08.059 --> 00:15:09.059
What are you doing?

253
00:15:09.059 --> 00:15:14.139
Lucy faded and she sounded stomach pains.

254
00:15:14.139 --> 00:15:15.500
Oh, that hurt.

255
00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:19.190
And when was another child?

256
00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:22.190
Well, it was so special about a trust fund, baby.

257
00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:25.419
Just another pretty face with no brains.

258
00:15:25.419 --> 00:15:28.419
Lucy, on the other hand, is Dr. T.

259
00:15:28.419 --> 00:15:38.210
A miserable price for what happened to my baby.

260
00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:39.210
Babies?

261
00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:40.210
What baby?

262
00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:45.009
There once was a grandson of yours.

263
00:15:45.009 --> 00:15:48.259
And about two months ago, he was gone.

264
00:15:48.259 --> 00:15:54.100
Good.

265
00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:57.100
If there was a child, it would have been a bastard.

266
00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:59.480
Bad for the family name, anyway.

267
00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:02.769
You don't care at all that it was my son?

268
00:16:02.769 --> 00:16:06.759
What is so great about her morning?

269
00:16:06.759 --> 00:16:09.759
She flirts with every man who gives her a shred of attention.

270
00:16:09.759 --> 00:16:11.759
Unlike Lucy, who's completely devoted to you.

271
00:16:11.759 --> 00:16:12.759
She even...

272
00:16:12.759 --> 00:16:16.870
Okay, stop.

273
00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:18.870
You know, sometimes I can't even tell.

274
00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:21.509
If I'm really your son.

275
00:16:21.509 --> 00:16:40.379
For now on, I want my schedule linked up with Hermione's schedule.

276
00:16:40.379 --> 00:16:41.470
Make that happen.

277
00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:42.470
You got a bus?

278
00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:49.659
Hermione, why are you still alive?

279
00:16:49.659 --> 00:16:52.919
How did you become this wealthy heiress?

280
00:16:52.919 --> 00:16:54.950
I have no choice now.

281
00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:57.950
You have to die before everyone learns your Dr. T.

282
00:16:57.950 --> 00:16:59.950
Hey, I need a favor.

283
00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:31.619
Talk to you for a sec.

284
00:17:31.619 --> 00:17:35.619
I'm actually on my way to go to BK to discuss an acquisition right now, so...

285
00:17:35.619 --> 00:17:36.619
Can we talk later?

286
00:17:36.619 --> 00:17:37.619
Uh-uh.

287
00:17:37.619 --> 00:17:38.619
One BK.

288
00:17:38.619 --> 00:17:46.619
BK is the largest AI company in the southeast,

289
00:17:46.619 --> 00:17:49.619
and as the Garcia family's wanting to move into that territory,

290
00:17:49.619 --> 00:17:51.619
it would make great headway for us to acquire them.

291
00:17:51.619 --> 00:17:52.619
Okay.

292
00:17:52.619 --> 00:17:53.619
I'll come with you.

293
00:17:53.619 --> 00:17:56.619
Do you even know how to negotiate an imminent deal?

294
00:17:56.619 --> 00:17:58.380
No.

295
00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:00.380
Exactly.

296
00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:08.400
Bus, the data security on her mind?

297
00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:09.400
It's today.

298
00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:11.400
Our team can't get in.

299
00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:12.589
Why not?

300
00:18:12.589 --> 00:18:13.589
She might find out.

301
00:18:13.589 --> 00:18:21.710
And, well, she won't be too happy.

302
00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:22.710
Henry!

303
00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:23.740
What's going on?

304
00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:32.359
Well, BK is a mess, and their books are practically held up by nothing.

305
00:18:32.359 --> 00:18:38.099
So, why would your father want to acquire it?

306
00:18:38.099 --> 00:18:47.240
The Garcia's are acquiring BK?

307
00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:48.240
John?

308
00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:52.240
I want you to find me Bob Wheat, president of BK right now.

309
00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:58.619
Copy that?

310
00:18:58.619 --> 00:19:00.619
Bus, don't stress too much.

311
00:19:00.619 --> 00:19:02.619
Bob, we may be a creep, but...

312
00:19:02.619 --> 00:19:04.619
Hermione's still the Garcia's. He wouldn't dare cross it.

313
00:19:04.619 --> 00:19:05.619
Shut up.

314
00:19:05.619 --> 00:19:07.619
Drive the car.

315
00:19:07.619 --> 00:19:12.579
Yeah.

316
00:19:12.579 --> 00:19:15.599
Mr. Wheat.

317
00:19:15.599 --> 00:19:16.599
You like these prices?

318
00:19:16.599 --> 00:19:18.599
I can go ahead and finalize the deal.

319
00:19:18.599 --> 00:19:43.220
But first, let's, uh, let's have a drink to celebrate.

320
00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:46.539
This isn't remotely enough.

321
00:19:46.539 --> 00:19:50.539
We need drinks worthy of the size of this deal.

322
00:19:50.539 --> 00:19:54.500
Vodka is strong, Laker.

323
00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:55.500
Take it easy, Hermione.

324
00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:56.500
Don't spoil your stomach.

325
00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:57.500
Don't you know that?

326
00:19:57.500 --> 00:19:58.500
Oh, I know.

327
00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:03.190
But I always prefer it.

328
00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:05.190
When there's enough of it to spill.

329
00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:07.190
You think you can drug me?

330
00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:08.190
Then what?

331
00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:12.190
If you're going to marry me into my family fortune, take a look at yourself in the mirror.

332
00:20:12.190 --> 00:20:13.190
First.

333
00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:14.190
You bitch.

334
00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:18.369
Doesn't matter how I look.

335
00:20:18.369 --> 00:20:25.299
I'm gonna be my doll. I'll make sure of it.

336
00:20:25.299 --> 00:20:26.299
How are you gonna do that?

337
00:20:26.299 --> 00:20:28.299
Well, you're already guessed it.

338
00:20:28.299 --> 00:20:30.660
I'm gonna sleep with you.

339
00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:34.190
And then I'll take photos.

340
00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:37.829
And I'll blackmail your father into marrying us.

341
00:20:37.829 --> 00:20:42.240
And if he doesn't, I'll leave the photos.

342
00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:46.240
So, whether you drink the Laker or not, you're not leaving.

343
00:20:46.240 --> 00:21:04.579
Are you okay?

344
00:21:04.579 --> 00:21:11.799
What a surprise.

345
00:21:11.799 --> 00:21:14.799
Well, I figured, you didn't want her anymore.

346
00:21:14.799 --> 00:21:16.799
You know, being engaged and everything.

347
00:21:16.799 --> 00:21:17.930
But you know what?

348
00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:20.930
If you're still interested, I'll back off.

349
00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:36.329
Did he hurt you?

350
00:21:36.329 --> 00:21:41.720
And be care partners.

351
00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:44.170
You sure you want to hit me over it?

352
00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:45.170
Used women?

353
00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:47.170
Used women.

354
00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:53.349
You know, some people are way out of your league.

355
00:21:53.349 --> 00:21:55.349
And every time that you touch them,

356
00:21:55.349 --> 00:21:59.349
there's always going to be consequences for your actions.

357
00:21:59.349 --> 00:22:08.390
You're hurting you?

358
00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:09.740
Yes.

359
00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:11.740
And you knew exactly who Bob was

360
00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:13.740
and what state his company was in.

361
00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:15.740
And you still managed to walk into that meeting now.

362
00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:20.740
If I didn't show up today, do you know what could have happened to you?

363
00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:22.869
I want to do business with Bob.

364
00:22:22.869 --> 00:22:24.869
Of course I have ways of handling him.

365
00:22:24.869 --> 00:22:26.869
What's weird is how you knew where I was.

366
00:22:26.869 --> 00:22:28.869
Are you following me?

367
00:22:28.869 --> 00:22:31.220
No.

368
00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:34.650
No.

369
00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:36.160
No.

370
00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:37.160
I'm not your assistant.

371
00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:38.160
I was not.

372
00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:39.160
I'm not your assistant.

373
00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:41.609
My business is none of your concern.

374
00:22:41.609 --> 00:22:45.609
And if you keep following me, that's harassment and I'm going to sue.

375
00:22:45.609 --> 00:22:51.500
Okay.

376
00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:54.460
Henry, where's the one that told me?

377
00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:58.769
Where are you going?

378
00:22:58.769 --> 00:23:00.769
You know I'm going to acquire BK.

379
00:23:00.769 --> 00:23:03.789
So my fiance has a big mouth.

380
00:23:03.789 --> 00:23:04.789
That's on him.

381
00:23:04.789 --> 00:23:07.789
But if you keep using him to spy on me,

382
00:23:07.789 --> 00:23:10.500
I'm not going to forgive you.

383
00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:19.500
fiance?

384
00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:20.500
Mm-hmm.

385
00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:21.500
Because the last time I checked,

386
00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:26.500
he was just a neighbor that you had a failed blindie with.

387
00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:31.279
Are we interested in my life?

388
00:23:31.279 --> 00:23:32.279
Mm-hmm.

389
00:23:32.279 --> 00:23:34.279
Aren't you worried your fiance may get jealous?

390
00:23:34.279 --> 00:23:38.140
Now do you really want to talk about that right now?

391
00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:39.910
I am.

392
00:23:39.910 --> 00:23:45.200
Should I just pretend she doesn't exist and be so thankful you still want me to be your mistress?

393
00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:53.559
Shut up.

394
00:23:53.559 --> 00:23:58.319
Or I will kiss you right now.

395
00:23:58.319 --> 00:23:59.319
Let her go.

396
00:23:59.319 --> 00:24:08.519
What do you think you're doing?

397
00:24:08.519 --> 00:24:11.220
It's him.

398
00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:21.039
No, you told me that Henry was your fiance.

399
00:24:21.039 --> 00:24:23.740
So who the fuck is this guy?

400
00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:25.259
Who, him?

401
00:24:25.259 --> 00:24:29.339
This is the man I actually love.

402
00:24:29.339 --> 00:24:33.720
Hermione has learned a lot in three years at LM.

403
00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:36.700
But that's over.

404
00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:38.700
You missed my birthday.

405
00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:40.700
How are you going to make it up to me?

406
00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:41.700
Mm-hmm.

407
00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:45.700
A machine you'll love custom made based on your size.

408
00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:47.470
No.

409
00:24:47.470 --> 00:24:48.470
He even knows their sizes?

410
00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:49.470
Boston.

411
00:24:49.470 --> 00:24:52.529
Well, Mr. Evans is busy.

412
00:24:52.529 --> 00:24:54.529
Let's not disturb him.

413
00:24:54.529 --> 00:25:01.299
Why should I leave with him?

414
00:25:01.299 --> 00:25:02.299
Did you save her on time?

415
00:25:02.299 --> 00:25:07.210
Shut the fuck up.

416
00:25:07.210 --> 00:25:10.509
Why are you here?

417
00:25:10.509 --> 00:25:11.509
What do you need?

418
00:25:11.509 --> 00:25:13.509
The BK case is finalist.

419
00:25:13.509 --> 00:25:16.509
Bob's in jail for tax evasion and the BK's style I construct.

420
00:25:16.509 --> 00:25:19.769
I'd say now it's time to buy the dip.

421
00:25:19.769 --> 00:25:26.940
Fix BK's issues and then give it to her.

422
00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:29.420
So?

423
00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:33.109
Oh, her mind.

424
00:25:33.109 --> 00:25:37.109
While you're at it, find out every piece of information you can

425
00:25:37.109 --> 00:25:39.369
on that fool.

426
00:25:39.369 --> 00:25:41.910
What the fool?

427
00:25:41.910 --> 00:25:53.480
You took a big risk today.

428
00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:56.509
I don't like Chris, but had he not been there,

429
00:25:56.509 --> 00:25:57.509
could have gone ugly.

430
00:25:57.509 --> 00:25:59.509
At least I could have handled Bob.

431
00:25:59.509 --> 00:26:02.740
Chris provided IRS information on Bob.

432
00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:04.740
But he got away from the cops.

433
00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:07.829
He now can acquire BK with pennies on the dollar.

434
00:26:07.829 --> 00:26:08.829
He's helping you.

435
00:26:08.829 --> 00:26:12.210
He just cannot help himself.

436
00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:13.210
I don't need his help.

437
00:26:13.210 --> 00:26:14.210
True.

438
00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:15.210
True.

439
00:26:15.210 --> 00:26:16.210
But it's done.

440
00:26:16.210 --> 00:26:19.230
Why not try it out?

441
00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:21.960
Here.

442
00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:22.960
I guess I'm going to show you.

443
00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:28.599
This is scared.

444
00:26:28.599 --> 00:26:29.599
Yeah.

445
00:26:29.599 --> 00:26:32.599
She's trying to convince everybody that she's tea before I expose her.

446
00:26:32.599 --> 00:26:34.599
How long is she going to keep lying for?

447
00:26:34.599 --> 00:26:37.599
I mean, if she's not tea, Chris wouldn't look twice at her,

448
00:26:37.599 --> 00:26:38.599
let alone marry her.

449
00:26:38.599 --> 00:26:40.599
She probably thinks she's going to get away with it.

450
00:26:40.599 --> 00:26:41.599
Hey, don't take us home.

451
00:26:41.599 --> 00:26:44.460
Let's go crash the press conference.

452
00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:53.150
Crash the press conference.

453
00:26:53.150 --> 00:26:54.150
Oh, yeah.

454
00:26:54.150 --> 00:26:56.539
A good battle needs good armor.

455
00:26:56.539 --> 00:26:59.599
And I want my sister going in there looking like a queen.

456
00:26:59.599 --> 00:27:00.599
Daddy boy!

457
00:27:00.599 --> 00:27:01.599
You're the best.

458
00:27:04.839 --> 00:27:05.839
Video conference.

459
00:27:05.839 --> 00:27:06.839
Must it be right now?

460
00:27:06.839 --> 00:27:07.839
Go ahead, take it.

461
00:27:07.839 --> 00:27:08.839
All righties.

462
00:27:08.839 --> 00:27:09.839
I can handle this.

463
00:27:09.839 --> 00:27:22.660
You still look as best as ever.

464
00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:24.660
Show us your best.

465
00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:26.660
My daughter-in-law has a press conference.

466
00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:29.660
And I want her to look like a queen.

467
00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:31.660
Of course, Mrs. Evans.

468
00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:34.660
We just got in a new dress straight off the runway.

469
00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:37.660
It's practically made for your beautiful daughter-in-law.

470
00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:38.660
Right this way.

471
00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:48.569
This dress is not for you.

472
00:27:48.569 --> 00:27:49.569
Sorry.

473
00:27:49.569 --> 00:27:50.569
What is that supposed to mean?

474
00:27:50.569 --> 00:27:53.569
What she means is, you don't deserve it.

475
00:27:53.569 --> 00:27:57.869
I don't deserve it.

476
00:27:57.869 --> 00:27:58.869
And what?

477
00:27:58.869 --> 00:28:00.930
You do?

478
00:28:00.930 --> 00:28:05.930
This section of the store is reserved for our diamond rank customers only.

479
00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:09.930
Without a VIP membership, we can't sell it to you.

480
00:28:09.930 --> 00:28:10.930
Is that so?

481
00:28:10.930 --> 00:28:17.140
Are you crazy?

482
00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:19.299
Can I buy it now?

483
00:28:19.299 --> 00:28:20.299
Find the owner.

484
00:28:20.299 --> 00:28:22.299
Buy the store.

485
00:28:22.299 --> 00:28:24.779
Do you mean the dress?

486
00:28:24.779 --> 00:28:26.839
That dress is worth $40,000.

487
00:28:26.839 --> 00:28:28.839
I think you might smoke us.

488
00:28:28.839 --> 00:28:29.839
No.

489
00:28:29.839 --> 00:28:33.099
Buy the store.

490
00:28:33.099 --> 00:28:39.099
Over one torn dress.

491
00:28:39.099 --> 00:28:44.960
You have to cherish what's yours.

492
00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:48.730
Lucy, forget this clown.

493
00:28:48.730 --> 00:28:50.819
How about this one?

494
00:28:50.819 --> 00:28:54.819
Mrs. Evans, you have a good eye.

495
00:28:54.819 --> 00:28:55.819
This is our signature.

496
00:28:55.819 --> 00:28:58.819
You won't find one anywhere else like it.

497
00:28:58.819 --> 00:29:00.819
And the price reflects that.

498
00:29:00.819 --> 00:29:02.819
It's 100 grand.

499
00:29:02.819 --> 00:29:04.950
That's too much.

500
00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:07.950
Lucy, it's just what you need.

501
00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:09.950
You're revealing yourself as Dr. T.

502
00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:11.950
You must stand out.

503
00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:17.950
So certain people can't go around and pretend to be Dr. T anymore.

504
00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:19.589
Yeah, no, I agree with Mrs. Evans.

505
00:29:19.589 --> 00:29:21.589
Lucy, you should buy the dress.

506
00:29:21.589 --> 00:29:26.589
Because soon, all you'll be able to wear are jumpsuits in prison.

507
00:29:26.589 --> 00:29:28.750
How dare you stop?

508
00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:32.089
Stop!

509
00:29:32.089 --> 00:29:34.430
Are you okay?

510
00:29:34.430 --> 00:29:37.529
She just cursed your fiancee.

511
00:29:37.529 --> 00:29:38.529
You do something.

512
00:29:38.529 --> 00:29:39.529
fiancee.

513
00:29:39.529 --> 00:29:44.009
Mother, do you really want to have this conversation right now?

514
00:29:44.009 --> 00:29:46.009
Mrs. Evans, it's okay.

515
00:29:46.009 --> 00:29:48.009
Her minding was just joking.

516
00:29:48.009 --> 00:29:51.390
Oh, I was so not joking.

517
00:29:51.390 --> 00:29:52.390
You.

518
00:29:52.390 --> 00:29:54.390
So, how about the dress?

519
00:29:54.390 --> 00:29:55.390
We're taking it.

520
00:29:55.390 --> 00:29:57.390
We'll wait just a moment.

521
00:29:57.390 --> 00:29:59.490
Mrs. Evans, I am very sorry.

522
00:29:59.490 --> 00:30:03.490
That dress was actually purchased half a minute ago.

523
00:30:03.490 --> 00:30:06.640
We saw it first.

524
00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:08.640
We're a diamond VIPs, you know?

525
00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:10.640
And I am really very sorry.

526
00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:13.640
The buyer was our new owner himself.

527
00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:20.640
He did say that if Miss Brown really wants it, she can pay ten times the price.

528
00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:21.640
Ten times?

529
00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:23.640
That's a million dollars.

530
00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:25.640
Amazingly a million dollars.

531
00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:26.829
Quiet.

532
00:30:26.829 --> 00:30:28.829
How about we make a deal?

533
00:30:28.829 --> 00:30:34.440
I will buy the dress right here and right now for one million dollars.

534
00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:39.569
And you, Mother, cannot tell me what to do any longer.

535
00:30:39.569 --> 00:30:45.279
Final pay for it.

536
00:30:45.279 --> 00:30:47.630
Thank you, Mrs. Evans.

537
00:30:47.630 --> 00:30:49.630
Your happiness is all that matters.

538
00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:57.240
Look forward to your next visit.

539
00:30:57.240 --> 00:31:04.009
Mrs. Garcia, as the new owner, would you like to see some of the new styles we have coming our way?

540
00:31:04.009 --> 00:31:05.009
What?

541
00:31:05.009 --> 00:31:06.009
She's the new owner.

542
00:31:06.009 --> 00:31:09.009
Sorry, I'm the new owner.

543
00:31:09.009 --> 00:31:13.539
Sorry, I'm the new owner.

544
00:31:13.539 --> 00:31:16.930
Happy birthday, Assistant.

545
00:31:16.930 --> 00:31:22.859
Hmm.

546
00:31:22.859 --> 00:31:26.980
You really think I need another clothing store?

547
00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:30.259
Well, as the Garcia-Arris know.

548
00:31:30.259 --> 00:31:31.359
Right.

549
00:31:31.359 --> 00:31:35.359
But as a small kind gesture from me, yes.

550
00:31:35.359 --> 00:31:38.930
Are you mad?

551
00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:41.930
You gave her the store and made me pay a million dollars.

552
00:31:41.930 --> 00:31:43.930
Mrs. Evans, it's okay.

553
00:31:43.930 --> 00:31:45.930
We're running late for the press conference.

554
00:31:45.930 --> 00:31:47.990
We'll talk about this after.

555
00:31:49.250 --> 00:31:52.309
Chris, you will regret this.

556
00:31:52.309 --> 00:31:55.309
Hermione's just another pretty face.

557
00:31:55.309 --> 00:31:59.309
The Evans family needs a genius, like Lucy.

558
00:31:59.309 --> 00:32:09.140
One?

559
00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:11.940
I'm not your assistant anymore.

560
00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:13.940
Mrs. Garcia, to you.

561
00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:17.299
Second, my birthday was yesterday.

562
00:32:17.299 --> 00:32:20.299
A late birthday present and birthday wish were not needed.

563
00:32:20.299 --> 00:32:24.579
You know, I used to wish to spend this birthday alone with you.

564
00:32:24.579 --> 00:32:26.859
Not anymore.

565
00:32:26.859 --> 00:32:31.150
I don't need you.

566
00:32:38.170 --> 00:32:41.059
Sir.

567
00:32:41.059 --> 00:32:44.059
Please disregard everything that she just said.

568
00:32:44.059 --> 00:32:45.059
She is still the owner.

569
00:32:45.059 --> 00:32:46.059
Yes, sir.

570
00:32:46.059 --> 00:32:47.059
And her?

571
00:32:47.059 --> 00:32:49.819
You're fired.
