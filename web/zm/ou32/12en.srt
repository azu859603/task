1
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:04,809
Okay, let's see if we can get off first.

2
00:00:04,809 --> 00:00:06,809
Are you okay? Are you okay?

3
00:00:06,809 --> 00:00:08,810
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. Okay, let's go.

4
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:10,810
You need to stay away from her. He's bad luck.

5
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:12,810
Stay away from her?

6
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:16,160
Mmm, I think I'm gonna do the opposite.

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,149
I want a front row seat to his downfall.

8
00:00:20,149 --> 00:00:22,149
Let's go across to the press conference.

9
00:00:22,149 --> 00:00:23,149
Yeah.

10
00:00:23,149 --> 00:00:28,219
Henry!

11
00:00:28,219 --> 00:00:34,619
Yeah, I want you to check the suspicious activity at the clothing store.

12
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:46,820
Random flower pots don't just fall from the sky.

13
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,820
Thank you, everyone, for joining us today.

14
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:54,060
Miss Brown! How could you start without me?
