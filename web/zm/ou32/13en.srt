1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:07,940
How did this bitch not even hurt a little bit?

2
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:10,939
Ms. Garcia, does your presence here mean that the Garcia family

3
00:00:10,939 --> 00:00:12,939
is going to compete for Dr. T's patents?

4
00:00:12,939 --> 00:00:14,939
Are you trying to take Dr. T away from Ellen?

5
00:00:14,939 --> 00:00:17,940
Don't address questions to her.

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,940
Ms. Garcia, this is an internal meeting for LM.

7
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:22,940
I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

8
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:27,260
Actually, Hermione has been a part of LM for a very long time.

9
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:29,260
She's more than welcome to be here, sir.

10
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:31,260
This press conference is a closed set.

11
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,259
Yes, you.

12
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:36,259
You, can you please escort our guests to the seat near the door?

13
00:00:36,259 --> 00:00:49,390
Great.

14
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:51,939
Now we can proceed.

15
00:00:51,939 --> 00:00:53,939
Thank you, everyone, for joining us today.

16
00:00:53,939 --> 00:00:54,939
Wait!

17
00:00:54,939 --> 00:00:57,380
Plus, you've got to save your problem.

18
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:01,380
The service is under your attack again, and it's a whole lot stronger this time.
