1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,679
All right settle down we can identify the cause of failure and we can fix the problem, right boss

2
00:00:06,419 --> 00:00:08,419
The hackers inside our building

3
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:16,000
Will then to find him the virus has penetrated our main system. We're losing millions by the minute Lucy

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,239
What can we do? What can they do the fence system is down dr. T. What do we do Lucy?

5
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:26,760
Upgrade your system or something and buy us some time to find the hacker all right Jesus

6
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,679
We might watch dr. T in action. I got to record this dr. T. Can we film your screen?

7
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:39,820
I uh I was the latter dr. T stage, right? I shouldn't have to handle such a minor virus by myself

8
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:43,079
I'll give it to her

9
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:49,920
I mean the Garcia family claims to be the father of a I with the most advanced system and algorithm the world has ever seen

10
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:57,039
If Miss Garcia's can't even handle a rudimentary counter hack, maybe the Garcia system isn't as up to where's we thought

11
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:00,659
That's a fair point
