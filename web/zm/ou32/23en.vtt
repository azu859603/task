00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:08.630
His wound is deep, but he doesn't seem to be in any critical danger at the moment.

2
00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.630
But we would like to keep him for some further observations.

3
00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:12.630
Thank you.

4
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:13.789
Mm-hmm.

5
00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:14.789
Um...

6
00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:20.059
Get some rest, okay?

7
00:00:20.059 --> 00:00:21.059
Don't go.

8
00:00:21.059 --> 00:00:25.710
Doc, do you think he can give us a minute?

9
00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:26.710
Turn my...

10
00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.260
Doesn't...

11
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.460
Touch me.

12
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.020
I have a man waiting for me outside.

13
00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.020
Daniel?

14
00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.780
Yeah?

15
00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.259
Yeah, I heard you call him brother.

16
00:00:39.259 --> 00:00:40.259
Okay, so what?

17
00:00:40.259 --> 00:00:41.259
I still have a fiance.

18
00:00:41.259 --> 00:00:42.259
Remember?

19
00:00:42.259 --> 00:00:43.259
Henry?

20
00:00:43.259 --> 00:00:44.259
Yes.

21
00:00:44.259 --> 00:00:45.259
Yeah.

22
00:00:45.259 --> 00:00:46.259
Henry doesn't match up to me.

23
00:00:46.259 --> 00:00:49.219
And, you know, you can give it your best performance?

24
00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:52.210
I know you're not interested in him.

25
00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.560
Not one bit.

26
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:55.560
You're lying.

27
00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:08.280
I miss you, Hermione.

28
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.719
Mr. Evans, what are you trying to pull here?

29
00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:11.719
Yeah, sure.

30
00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:12.719
You got stabbed for me.

31
00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:13.959
But hey, I saved your company.

32
00:01:13.959 --> 00:01:15.250
So...

33
00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.409
We're even.

34
00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:26.180
Between us, we'll never be even.

35
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.260
You almost got him killed.

36
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.510
How dare you come here?

37
00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.629
I almost got him killed?

38
00:01:32.629 --> 00:01:33.629
Sure.

39
00:01:33.629 --> 00:01:34.629
He saved me.

40
00:01:34.629 --> 00:01:36.989
That must be so for real.

41
00:01:36.989 --> 00:01:37.989
This all started with Lucy.

42
00:01:37.989 --> 00:01:40.700
How can you back a liar like her?

43
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:41.700
I don't...

44
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:42.700
I don't get it.

45
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:43.700
Lucy's made mistakes.

46
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.890
But she's the daughter-in-law.

47
00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:46.890
I've chosen.

48
00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.900
Good for you.

49
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.579
I never wanted to be your daughter-in-law anyway.

50
00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:58.950
You know, I'm curious too, mother.

51
00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:07.189
Why do you continue to defend Lucy, who's a faker and a habitual liar?

52
00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:11.819
Why did you choose her to be my wife?

53
00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.939
Hermione and Chris are getting suspicious.

54
00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:19.659
What if they dig even deeper and come to the truth about everything?

55
00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:21.219
Don't worry.

56
00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:23.539
If your son finds out, he will cover for you.

57
00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:24.939
No, no, no, no.

58
00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:26.900
They cannot find out.

59
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.069
We have to make sure they don't even go near it.

60
00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:31.949
Think about it, Mrs. Evans.

61
00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:36.189
The only reason why Hermione is still poking at Chris is because she hasn't given up on

62
00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:37.189
him.

63
00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:38.750
Push the wedding forward.

64
00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.349
When Chris is married to me, Hermione will have no choice but to back off.
