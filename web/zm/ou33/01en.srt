1
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:19,399
We are finally married, my missus.

2
00:00:19,399 --> 00:00:22,399
I don't know if it feels like a dream.

3
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:23,399
I know.

4
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:30,000
Nothing feels, um, wrong or anything.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,109
No. No. Everything is perfect.

6
00:00:36,109 --> 00:00:42,450
You should. Maybe shower first.

7
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,450
Oh. Are you joining?

8
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:45,450
You're funny.

9
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:56,020
This is not what I agreed to.

10
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:59,020
You said I would never have to even meet him.

11
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:02,020
And now, not only am I married to the Miles Kipling,

12
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:09,780
but I have to live with him.

13
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,780
Our huge Dr. Hardy is finally back.

14
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:15,780
Doctors without borders must have been a blast.

15
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,780
I bet you didn't miss me at all.

16
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:19,780
Lane, my snarky sunshine.

17
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,780
I always do so much.

18
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,780
Oh, you shouldn't face that anymore.

19
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:25,780
My idiot sunflower.

20
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:28,780
Hey, I heard about your engagement.

21
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:29,780
Congratulations.

22
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:31,780
Oh, about that.

23
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:34,780
I just kind of have a favorite task here.

24
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:35,780
You.

25
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:37,780
The richest woman in LA.

26
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:39,780
Have a favorite to ask me.

27
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,819
Well, and only you can help me.

28
00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:44,819
You owe me one. No questions asked. Remember?

29
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:46,819
Alright, I did spit it out.

30
00:01:46,819 --> 00:01:51,180
I'll be a great-dyed mother.

31
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,180
What? You want me to marry your fiance in your place?
