00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.620
You want me to marry your fiancee in your place?

2
00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:04.259
Do you know what you're asking me?

3
00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:05.660
This is your fiance.

4
00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:07.620
Well, just pretend to be me for a month,

5
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.259
and I'll be right back, I promise.

6
00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:11.259
Pretty sure your fiancee will figure it out.

7
00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:12.500
It's an arranged marriage.

8
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.859
We've only met once.

9
00:00:13.859 --> 00:00:16.339
And everybody's been saying that we look alike,

10
00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:20.300
so just register the marriage and pretend to be me.

11
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.899
It should be hard.

12
00:00:24.469 --> 00:00:26.309
Just for the registration.

13
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.100
All right. All right. I'll do this favor.

14
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.100
No questions asked.

15
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.100
Thank you, thank you, thank you,

16
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.310
thank you, Chloe, my husband's friend.

17
00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.310
Just like a sunflower would never turn its back to the sunshine,

18
00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.109
the sunshine will always shine on her flower.

19
00:00:43.109 --> 00:01:45.700
It's him. How is this possible?

20
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.099
Who you marry me?
