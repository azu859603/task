1
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:07,019
Not only am I married to the Miles Kipling, but I have to live with him?

2
00:00:07,019 --> 00:00:12,779
Not a big deal. Okay, I'll be back in a month. Miles, he had accident years ago.

3
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:18,379
He can't really tell people's faces apart, so it should be easy to convince him.

4
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,219
So that's why.

5
00:00:23,739 --> 00:00:45,840
He's the only one donating and volunteering around here. I'm like some rich jerks.

6
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:48,030
He actually cares.

7
00:00:56,829 --> 00:01:02,380
He doesn't remember me. That's why he asked me to marry him.

8
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:09,170
Bigger wife, do you think suspicious? Or, you know, do what you need to?

9
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:15,730
I know, I know, right, right. Bestie code, I will not lay a hand on your man.

10
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:19,170
I mean, that's not really what I am trying to say.

11
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:20,530
Oh, I gotta go, he's back.

12
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:22,370
And, Clara, hold on.

13
00:01:31,629 --> 00:01:33,549
Are you planning on surprising me, my missus?

14
00:01:33,549 --> 00:01:40,750
You know, I've been waiting for this for a very long time.
