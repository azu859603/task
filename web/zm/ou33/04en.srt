1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I've been waiting for this for a very long time.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,919
No, uh, I can't.

3
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,300
You can't? Why?

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:14,289
Um...

5
00:00:14,289 --> 00:00:16,289
I just started my period.

6
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:18,289
My cramps hurt really bad.

7
00:00:18,289 --> 00:00:20,829
I just swore to Elaine.

8
00:00:20,829 --> 00:00:22,829
I can't break my promise.

9
00:00:22,829 --> 00:00:25,859
Ooh, I cramps with so much pain.

10
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,859
I gotta go. Sorry.

11
00:00:27,859 --> 00:00:29,859
No, no, no. No, you stay here, okay?

12
00:00:29,859 --> 00:00:30,859
Get some rest.

13
00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:39,780
I'll get you some money.

14
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:40,780
Okay.

15
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:42,810
I have done my research,

16
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:45,810
and this is the best medication for menstrual cramps.

17
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:50,369
I can't take painkillers.

18
00:00:50,369 --> 00:00:51,369
I can't take...

19
00:00:51,369 --> 00:00:52,369
Are you allergic?

20
00:00:52,369 --> 00:00:55,009
Or are you faking those cramps?

21
00:00:55,009 --> 00:01:03,899
What? Why would I lie about something like that?

22
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:06,900
Elaine is allergic, but I am.

23
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,900
I have to spit it out later when he's not looking.

24
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:52,650
She'll give me some honey, lemon, water.

25
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:54,650
I drink some before bed every night.

26
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:56,000
Of course.

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,159
Honey, lemon, water. Yeah.

28
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,159
Sure.
