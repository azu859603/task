00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:42.880
Are you gonna be back?

2
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.719
I can't do this for much longer.

3
00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:46.880
He's just too hard to resist.

4
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.399
And not only that, he's been my crush for so long.

5
00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:51.119
Do you like him?

6
00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:51.960
Yeah.

7
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.280
Yeah, he's fine.

8
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.920
Oh, good thing I don't like him at all, so go for it.

9
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.359
Dr. Herding, your patience here.

10
00:00:57.359 --> 00:00:58.640
Thank you.

11
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.280
I gotta go.

12
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.840
Your surgical wound is healing nicely.

13
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.840
Just continue to rest and you'll be fine.

14
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:06.680
Oh, okay.

15
00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:11.049
Well, Doc, can we have sex anytime soon?

16
00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.560
You can't just ask that.

17
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.760
That's embarrassing.

18
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:15.599
What's the big deal?

19
00:01:15.599 --> 00:01:17.000
I'm your wife and I care about that.

20
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.359
I'll never catch asking like a more polite way.

21
00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:20.359
All right.

22
00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:22.359
Dr. Hardy,

23
00:01:23.629 --> 00:01:27.269
when can we have sexual intercourse or make love

24
00:01:27.269 --> 00:01:30.390
or become one?

25
00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:41.420
I'm sorry to say, but not just yet.

26
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:42.900
That's a great excuse.

27
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:56.680
Oh, careful.

28
00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.319
I pulled my surgical wound today

29
00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:00.379
and the doctor had to fix me again.

30
00:02:00.379 --> 00:02:03.579
Told me to rest, so still no go.

31
00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:05.219
You had surgery?

32
00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:17.830
Yeah, about two weeks ago.

33
00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.889
Where did you get your report?

34
00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:21.770
This looks super legit.

35
00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.409
Where are you insinuating?

36
00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:25.719
That is a real doctor's report.

37
00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:27.199
Why did you keep taking them lying?

38
00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:30.060
This is your report for your surgery.

39
00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.900
You sure about.

40
00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.099
When exactly did you grow a prostate?
