1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
When exactly did you grow a prostate?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Shit, I packed the wrong report.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I can't wait to hear how you're going to explain this.

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,740
I did have surgery, okay? I had an appendectomy.

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:18,109
If you say so, let me see the wound. It's probably...

6
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:20,140
You're gonna pull the wound again.

7
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:22,530
Let me see it.

8
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:45,070
See, I told you I wasn't lying.

9
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:48,829
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:48,829 --> 00:00:52,750
I must have just gotten the report to mix up.

11
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,750
You sure it's not like a sticker or a tattoo or something?

12
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:00,710
I got the sticker from her friend in the plastic surgery department.

13
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:03,710
It cost me $100 for God's sake.

14
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:08,629
I'm your wife, and I love you.

15
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:10,890
But it hurts that you don't believe me.

16
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:28,189
I'm to wake up, my missus.

17
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:36,280
My house, we can't be intimate right now.

18
00:01:37,819 --> 00:01:39,819
No, no, no, no. It's not about that.

19
00:01:40,819 --> 00:01:48,819
I wanted to wake you up and get ready because my grandma invited us to go celebrate Jesse's return from England.

20
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,019
What? Lunch with grandma and Jesse?

21
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:00,939
I ate this arranged marriage with Elaine.

22
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:04,030
Now he's changed all of a sudden.

23
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:06,290
It's weird, grandma.

24
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:09,289
Well, Jesse, it happens.

25
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,639
My husband and I were arranged too.

26
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:15,639
And once we married, we fell in love.

27
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:17,639
This is different.

28
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:19,639
It's a scheme.

29
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:21,639
I'll show you when they get here.

30
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:24,639
If you've got to stop watching this soap opera.

31
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:46,580
You don't have to be nervous. My grandma's nice.

32
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,419
Elaine says they've never met.

33
00:02:50,419 --> 00:02:51,419
It should be fine.

34
00:02:52,419 --> 00:03:02,479
I'm not joking. I have proof.

35
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:07,740
Oh, what were you proving?

36
00:03:09,699 --> 00:03:11,699
I agree, my. This is Elaine, my wife.

37
00:03:13,699 --> 00:03:15,020
Elaine, grandma, Joyce.

38
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,020
Joyce, I'm so happy to meet you.

39
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:20,120
So lovely to meet you too.

40
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,300
Let's help lunch.

41
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,400
This is my seat.

42
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:39,620
I'm sorry, I thought this was a family gathering.

43
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,620
Why is a stranger here?

44
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:46,870
My family has been friends with the Kipling's for decades.

45
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:48,870
How dare you call me a stranger?

46
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:53,060
And how dare you sit beside Milesy?

47
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,060
When you're not even Elaine, Kipling.

48
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,960
How dare you sit beside Miles?

49
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,960
When you're not even Elaine, Kipling.

50
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:17,959
I'll show you the proof.

51
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:22,110
Here is a picture from the engagement party.

52
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,430
Elaine Priestley doesn't have a birthmark on her neck.

53
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:29,430
She does.

54
00:04:32,029 --> 00:04:33,029
Birthmark, what birthmark?

55
00:04:34,029 --> 00:04:36,029
Elaine made sure no photos from the engagement party were left behind.

56
00:04:37,029 --> 00:04:38,029
I bet she snatched it.

57
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:40,029
Who are you?

58
00:04:41,029 --> 00:04:44,029
Why are you pretending to be Elaine Priestley and marry my Milesy?

59
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,480
Well, can I have a look?

60
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,180
Sure, but it's not a birthmark.

61
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:54,180
It's actually a new tattoo that I got.

62
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:10,199
Messing with my wife, Jessie.

63
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
No, no buts.

64
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
If you do this again, I'll have to ask you to leave.

65
00:05:18,939 --> 00:05:19,939
She says it's a tattoo.

66
00:05:20,939 --> 00:05:21,939
Then it's a tattoo.

67
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,220
Why aren't you sleeping together then?

68
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:30,079
That's on.

69
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:33,079
Clearly, she's hiding something.

70
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,079
Wait, what's going on?

71
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:37,079
Are the two of you not in love?

72
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:39,079
Because if you're not, you can get a divorce.

73
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:42,079
This is all just so ridiculous.

74
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:45,079
Miles and I actually can't keep our hands to ourselves.

75
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:47,079
We do it like every day.

76
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:49,079
Fine.

77
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:51,300
Impossible.

78
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:58,490
I asked your housekeeper.

79
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
They said you weren't intimate at all.

80
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Housekeepers know.

81
00:06:07,339 --> 00:06:11,339
Nothing, because Miles sends them away so that we can have some privacy.

82
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:15,579
She's just making up stories again.

83
00:06:16,579 --> 00:06:17,899
Tell me the truth, Miles.

84
00:06:18,899 --> 00:06:19,899
You've never lied to me.

85
00:06:20,899 --> 00:06:23,180
Grandma, we are.

86
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,180
We're perfectly fine.

87
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,180
See?

88
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,180
There's nothing to be worth.

89
00:06:30,709 --> 00:06:31,709
Covering for her.

90
00:06:32,709 --> 00:06:34,829
Why?

91
00:06:34,829 --> 00:06:36,829
What do you want to watch us do it, just to be sure?

92
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:41,019
He's covering up to save the marriage.

93
00:06:42,019 --> 00:06:43,019
He must really like Elaine.

94
00:06:44,019 --> 00:06:45,019
Enough of this nonsense.

95
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,240
Let's have lunch and peace.

96
00:06:53,899 --> 00:06:54,899
Don't mind her.

97
00:06:55,899 --> 00:06:57,899
She's been a friend of the family for so long.

98
00:06:58,899 --> 00:06:59,899
We've definitely smelled her too much.

99
00:07:01,899 --> 00:07:08,009
My Ayurveda practitioner recommended this liquor.

100
00:07:09,009 --> 00:07:12,009
He said it's good for a young people's health.

101
00:07:13,009 --> 00:07:14,009
You know what I mean.

102
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:20,399
I don't think that'll be necessary, grandma.

103
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,399
Sounds a little anti-science, Joyce.

104
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:28,399
Miles, if it's true, but Elaine said, I think you need this.

105
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:34,399
Dr. Gupta says it supplements the soul's energy and heats up the mud.

106
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:37,399
Are you sure it's not just purely an aphrodisiac?

107
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:41,589
I'm not really struggling in the energy department, grandma.

108
00:07:42,589 --> 00:07:47,360
In fact, I'm in more need of demand than supply.

109
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,379
What?

110
00:07:51,379 --> 00:07:53,629
What do you mean was Elaine lying?

111
00:07:54,629 --> 00:07:59,629
I live once now.

112
00:08:05,209 --> 00:08:06,209
Here's to a wonderful night.

113
00:08:06,209 --> 00:08:14,920
This is going to be a wonderful night.

114
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:21,399
Let's get you to bed.

115
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:23,529
Okay.

116
00:08:23,529 --> 00:08:25,170
It's a nice and cozy.

117
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:30,560
Have a good night.

118
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:35,570
I've liked you for a long time.

119
00:08:36,889 --> 00:08:39,820
No, no. Get some rest, okay?

120
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:43,580
We don't go. I want a hook.

121
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:52,080
I really should be going.

122
00:08:56,179 --> 00:08:57,179
You smell so good.

123
00:08:59,909 --> 00:09:01,009
Thank you.

124
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:04,009
I should be going before this gets messy.

125
00:09:05,009 --> 00:09:20,500
What is this?

126
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:24,740
Miles, I can explain.

127
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:25,740
What is this?

128
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:27,740
Miles, you lied to me.

129
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,740
Didn't you?

130
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:32,220
I hate when people lied to me.

131
00:09:33,629 --> 00:09:34,629
You drive me crazy.

132
00:09:35,629 --> 00:10:40,059
Elaine's husband, what are you thinking?

133
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,809
Hey, where are you going?

134
00:10:45,809 --> 00:10:47,809
I'm sorry, Miles. I apologize.

135
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:50,990
Apologize for what?

136
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:57,590
Until Miles.

137
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,299
It hurts.

138
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:02,190
It still hurts.

139
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,580
Yes, it still hurts.

140
00:11:05,929 --> 00:11:07,090
How about when I do this?

141
00:11:08,309 --> 00:11:09,309
Yes, it hurts worse there, please.

142
00:11:10,309 --> 00:11:13,309
Well, if it hurts wearing them, you don't have to hide it.

143
00:11:14,309 --> 00:11:15,309
You don't have to wear high heels.

144
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:18,759
I know. I won't, again.

145
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:21,759
Well, I should probably call the family doctor.

146
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,980
Oh, I... it's... it's not that serious.

147
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:29,980
Leg injuries can be very serious, okay? It's just a precaution.

148
00:11:32,809 --> 00:11:33,809
I'm a doctor myself.

149
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:39,100
Thank you.

150
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:43,879
Thank you, doctor.

151
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:45,879
Well, you heard him.

152
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,299
No more high heels for a while, okay?

153
00:11:55,929 --> 00:11:56,929
It's still avoiding me.

154
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,220
I'm not dumb.

155
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:02,179
If you don't have feelings for me, then...

156
00:12:03,179 --> 00:12:05,179
You don't have to stay together. We can get a divorce.

157
00:12:07,009 --> 00:12:08,009
I don't want a divorce.

158
00:12:09,009 --> 00:12:13,139
A divorce you.

159
00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:15,399
I'm just not ready yet. I know it's weird.

160
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,330
Miles, I... like you a lot.

161
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:23,330
And I've liked you for a very long time.

162
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:25,330
Longer than you'll ever know.

163
00:12:26,899 --> 00:12:27,899
It just feels unreal being your wife.

164
00:12:28,899 --> 00:12:32,350
I feel so out of place and everything happens so fast.

165
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:39,289
Okay. Okay. I get it.

166
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:41,639
You do?

167
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,200
What if we give it a month?

168
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:50,740
In the meantime, I'll do my best to make this easy for you.

169
00:12:52,289 --> 00:12:56,830
And at the end, if you still don't want this, we'll get a divorce.

170
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:59,980
What do you say?

171
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:03,559
One month. That's just enough time, Burling, to get back.

172
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:05,559
Deal.

173
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:18,539
Could you wrap this up for me, please?

174
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,600
And a card too.

175
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,600
I'd like to make a message up to my best friend.

176
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,789
Okay.

177
00:13:24,789 --> 00:13:25,789
Miles, wait for me.

178
00:13:26,789 --> 00:13:28,789
Keep your distance, Jesse. I'm a married man.

179
00:13:29,789 --> 00:13:38,580
I know you'd like me better, but Elaine would be so mad.

180
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:43,590
Miles? Miles?

181
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,360
This is not what it looks like.

182
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:51,490
Oh, I know. I saw Jesse throw herself on you.

183
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:54,490
I can't believe she thought that would work.

184
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:56,519
Elaine, Miles, how to me?

185
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:58,519
Shut up, Jesse.

186
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,519
And I don't want to hear any more of these childish games.

187
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:03,519
Okay. Do I have to send you back to England?

188
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:06,190
I hate the food there.

189
00:14:07,539 --> 00:14:08,539
Good. Okay. Great.

190
00:14:09,539 --> 00:14:11,539
Well, I don't want to hear one more peep from you, or else I'll lose my mind.

191
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:22,110
What are you doing here? Just shopping for something in particular?

192
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:25,980
She's your admin here. What about you?

193
00:14:27,809 --> 00:14:29,929
I'm just browsing.

194
00:14:30,929 --> 00:14:31,929
Your purchase, Miss.

195
00:14:32,929 --> 00:14:33,929
As you ask, we've made the card out to Elaine.

196
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:46,110
Told you she is buying Elaine gifts and writing her letters she is not Elaine.

197
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:49,940
It's not illegal to buy yourself.

198
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:54,779
Is it the platinum VIP card?

199
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,940
Miles, see? Do something.

200
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,940
I can't be the only one thinking this is weird, right?

201
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:04,019
You are.

202
00:15:05,019 --> 00:15:06,019
I believe my missus.

203
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:09,759
Welcome, our most prestigious guest, Elaine Priestley.

204
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:11,759
What the fuck is this?

205
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:14,759
This is all very unnecessary.

206
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:16,759
I'll just take my purchase and leave.

207
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,759
Your pre-orders have arrived.

208
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:20,759
We've been waiting for you to collect them.

209
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:22,759
This is the limited edition Barrow Wing Hills.

210
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,279
Box for a coat, only five worldwide.

211
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:33,279
Sunglasses from Volgary. They fit your face so well.

212
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,240
Why is she getting all this attention?

213
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,240
She's a fake.

214
00:15:42,379 --> 00:15:46,480
Thank you very much for everything. I'm so grateful.

215
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,480
Here you go.

216
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:00,879
It really hurts.

217
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:03,519
Yeah, it looks swollen.

218
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:09,809
Well, let's get you to the hospital.

219
00:16:09,809 --> 00:16:11,809
Rich girl buys heels and can't wear them.

220
00:16:12,809 --> 00:16:15,980
I'll expose you eventually.

221
00:16:19,539 --> 00:16:21,539
This is where I work. Someone will recognize me.

222
00:16:22,539 --> 00:16:24,539
You know, I've heard horrible things about this place.

223
00:16:25,539 --> 00:16:26,539
We should try another hospital.

224
00:16:27,539 --> 00:16:28,539
No, this one's the closest. Just hang on tight.

225
00:16:32,809 --> 00:16:33,809
My wife, St. Cole, is hers.

226
00:16:34,809 --> 00:16:36,809
All right, I need to keep a lot of the form. What's her name?

227
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,600
Clara, you're back from Africa.

228
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:49,179
You're back from Africa.

229
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:51,370
Is he talking to you?

230
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:53,370
No.

231
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:55,370
It's Brooke, your ex-boyfriend.

232
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:58,370
What ex? I never agreed to date him. It's all in his head.

233
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:01,620
Hey, my wife says she doesn't know you.

234
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:03,620
You're married?

235
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,390
Oh, that explains it.

236
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:09,390
You didn't go to Africa to work with doctors without borders.

237
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:12,390
You got married. I knew nobody would give up residency for charity.

238
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:15,650
You're going back to doctors ready, Clara.

239
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:18,640
Let's go.

240
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,250
Clara, she said she doesn't know you.

241
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:28,680
That is Clara Hurty. Why is she pretending to be someone else?

242
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:33,119
You said she's your ex-girlfriend.

243
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:37,099
Here's three mil.

244
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:39,140
Prove it, and it's yours.

245
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:44,819
Prove it, and it's yours.

246
00:17:45,819 --> 00:17:47,589
Well, it's easy.

247
00:17:48,589 --> 00:17:49,589
Clara is allergic to painkillers.

248
00:17:50,589 --> 00:17:52,589
She will have an immediate rash after taking any.

249
00:17:54,589 --> 00:17:59,329
I'll give it to you once the liar is exposed.

250
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:04,079
Hey, you didn't ask for my name.

251
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:07,849
Did you just trick the information out of me?

252
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:15,670
You know, I really didn't know that guy back there.

253
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:17,670
I believe you.

254
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:20,670
And that hospital. I really don't think we should go back.

255
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:22,670
What are you doing?

256
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:24,799
Getting you into the shower.

257
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:25,799
What?

258
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:30,740
Come on.

259
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:31,740
Funny, Miles. You promised me a month.

260
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:33,740
And I'm keeping that promise.

261
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:35,740
Well, then why do you?

262
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:38,740
Because the doctor said that we have to soak your foot in cold water.

263
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:40,740
Okay, it keeps us swelling down. I'm just trying to help.

264
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:42,740
All right, I get it.

265
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:44,740
You just enjoy playing with me, don't you?

266
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:48,630
Maybe I do. My missus.

267
00:18:49,630 --> 00:19:23,079
Joyce, I'll prove to you today that that bitch is not a lame priestly.

268
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:43,349
What are you doing?

269
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:44,640
Do you trust me?

270
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,900
Yes.

271
00:19:45,900 --> 00:20:01,140
What do you want?

272
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:05,289
I'm here to prove her identity.

273
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:07,539
It's fake.

274
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:08,539
Not interested. You can leave.

275
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:13,740
Elaine, I dare you to take these painkillers now.

276
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,740
If you do, I don't believe you.

277
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,150
Painkillers.

278
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,150
Does she know who I really am?

279
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:27,529
Dare. What's there to be afraid of?

280
00:20:28,529 --> 00:20:33,220
I need to take my meds anyway, so.

281
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:41,210
This watch, I already got the intel.

282
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:45,210
This bitch is allergic to painkillers.

283
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:47,210
So she swallows it.

284
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:00,220
Well, I've taken the painkiller.

285
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,220
Now, will you please excuse us?

286
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:08,940
Impossible.

287
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:09,940
How are you not affected?

288
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:13,160
You should be covered in hives right now.

289
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,160
What are you talking about?

290
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,160
Who told you I was allergic to painkillers?

291
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,190
Good thing I've been carrying into histamine since last time.

292
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:22,190
I took one earlier in the car.

293
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:25,190
Look at that. Nothing happened.

294
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:27,190
A lot of fuss over nothing.

295
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:29,990
Must be the dosage.

296
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:31,990
One pill isn't enough.

297
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:36,990
If you have the guts, I dare you to swallow the whole bottle.

298
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:38,990
Then and only then.

299
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:44,210
When is enough, ever enough with you, Jesse?

300
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:50,990
I promise that she is not late. I'll prove it to you.

301
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:52,990
Shut up, Jesse.

302
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:54,990
I've told you before.

303
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:56,990
You're not welcome here.

304
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:58,990
Leave.

305
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:03,900
I've got the dramatics.

306
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:05,900
Jesse, your tears aren't going to work here.

307
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:07,900
Get out of my house.

308
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:09,900
Sorry, Elaine.

309
00:22:15,539 --> 00:22:16,539
It's not Jessica.

310
00:22:17,539 --> 00:22:18,539
She had me bring her here tonight.

311
00:22:19,539 --> 00:22:21,539
I didn't mean to ruin your time together.

312
00:22:22,539 --> 00:22:24,539
Oh, a grandma. No need to worry.

313
00:22:25,539 --> 00:22:27,539
I take plenty of good care of my wife.

314
00:22:28,789 --> 00:22:31,789
Now, if you'll excuse us, you've got some business to get down to.

315
00:22:32,789 --> 00:22:34,529
Right. Yeah.

316
00:22:35,529 --> 00:22:36,529
Have a good night, grandma.

317
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:42,750
Sucking wet, my missus.

318
00:22:44,009 --> 00:22:45,009
Better get a try before you catch a cold.

319
00:22:46,009 --> 00:22:48,009
Because if you do, my grandma will never let me hear the end of that.

320
00:22:49,009 --> 00:22:55,349
Yeah.

321
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,480
Well, you guys have a good day.

322
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,480
All right. You guys have a good day.

323
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,480
Okay. Bye.

324
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,500
Something I can help you with, Miss?

325
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:17,140
Nothing. Nothing. You remind me of Gabriel.

326
00:23:19,829 --> 00:23:20,829
The angel. Gabriel?

327
00:23:21,829 --> 00:23:22,960
Never mind. It's stupid.

328
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,960
No. Yeah.

329
00:23:31,339 --> 00:23:32,339
You really are like Gabriel.

330
00:23:34,069 --> 00:23:35,490
Did you just say Gabriel?

331
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:38,029
Like the angel.

332
00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:42,559
Gabriel?

333
00:23:44,359 --> 00:23:45,579
Like the angel?

334
00:23:46,579 --> 00:23:49,630
What angel?

335
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:53,140
I meant like Gabriel walked the actor.

336
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:57,930
Well, you just said reminded me of someone.

337
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:00,410
Tell me why you said that.

338
00:24:02,339 --> 00:24:04,660
Or is Jesse right?

339
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:06,660
Are you not actually Elaine?

340
00:24:09,539 --> 00:24:10,539
It's my friend.

341
00:24:11,539 --> 00:24:14,579
She has this really weird obsession with angel references.

342
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:17,579
She likes to imagine what they might look like.

343
00:24:18,579 --> 00:24:19,579
Super nerdy, I know.

344
00:24:20,579 --> 00:24:21,579
But she told me about this guy.

345
00:24:22,579 --> 00:24:24,579
She had a crush on that reminded her of Gabriel.

346
00:24:24,579 --> 00:24:26,579
And I was like Gabriel who? And she said the angel.

347
00:24:27,579 --> 00:24:28,579
And maybe that's how it got mad.

348
00:24:29,579 --> 00:24:36,799
A woman who likes angels so much shouldn't lie.

349
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:38,799
Right. Right.

350
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:43,940
You're tired.

351
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,940
I think it all crazy like that.

352
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:50,940
It's time for bed it's late and nature calls.

353
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:52,940
I'm just kidding. The mission going?

354
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:06,740
He hadn't figured it out.

355
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:08,740
What are you coming back?

356
00:25:10,029 --> 00:25:11,029
I'm barely holding it together here.

357
00:25:12,029 --> 00:25:13,029
Wait. Are you wearing a hospital gown?

358
00:25:14,029 --> 00:25:15,289
Are you sick?

359
00:25:15,289 --> 00:25:22,079
Yeah.

360
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:25,079
I got caught in the rain just a little fever.

361
00:25:26,619 --> 00:25:27,619
Resting in the hospital for a couple of days.

362
00:25:28,619 --> 00:25:29,619
What a coincidence.

363
00:25:30,619 --> 00:25:33,619
I sprained my ankle so I guess I'll be resting for a few days too.

364
00:25:34,619 --> 00:25:45,880
That bitch Clara keeps claiming she's not who I think she is.

365
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,880
Not Jesse girl is willing to pay $3 million for proof of her identity.

366
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:55,880
But if I go directly to Clara, couldn't I extort even more?

367
00:26:06,059 --> 00:26:07,059
I know right.

368
00:26:07,059 --> 00:26:10,119
Oh, hang on. I got a text. Let me check it.

369
00:26:12,369 --> 00:26:13,369
Clara, I know what you're up to.

370
00:26:14,369 --> 00:26:15,369
Transfer $5 million by midnight.

371
00:26:16,369 --> 00:26:17,369
We're all telling your husband who you really are.

372
00:26:20,539 --> 00:26:22,539
Elaine, alright. Something came up. I gotta go. Bye.

373
00:26:23,539 --> 00:26:26,819
I can't let Brooke ruin Elaine's plan.

374
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:28,819
But we're gonna get that much money.

375
00:26:29,819 --> 00:26:35,630
Elaine, you should really call for me.

376
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:39,630
I'm here to help. You don't have to walk around on your own.

377
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:44,630
Miles looks like you're gonna have to make a small sacrifice for the sake of your marriage.

378
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:51,490
Miles, look at that ring. It's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.

379
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:55,490
You like that one? I'll have my assistant buy it for you tomorrow.

380
00:26:58,019 --> 00:26:59,019
What?

381
00:26:59,019 --> 00:27:01,019
Unless you wanted to buy it yourself.

382
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,180
No.

383
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:05,630
Oh, what's the matter? Do you not have the funds?

384
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:10,990
What's the matter? You don't have the funds?

385
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:13,990
Here, I'll send you some right now. Done.

386
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:25,460
Of course.

387
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,400
Money's been transferred. Don't bother me again.

388
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:59,250
Thanks to Miles, that asshole broke us out of my life.

389
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:01,250
Miles deserves to be rewarded.

390
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:06,910
Take the rest of the day off. I'll take care of things my husband drives.

391
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:11,980
Miles does home, really.

392
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,240
I knew it. You do know me.

393
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,240
Danger! Get out!

394
00:28:23,829 --> 00:28:26,829
Clara, you were in such a rush to leave for Africa.

395
00:28:27,829 --> 00:28:29,829
I didn't get the chance to sleep with you back then.

396
00:28:30,829 --> 00:28:31,829
But now?

397
00:28:31,829 --> 00:28:34,559
What are you doing?

398
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:37,200
I told you, Clara. You'll always be mine.

399
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,200
How dare you marry someone else behind my back.

400
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,200
Watch how I deal with you now.

401
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,200
Touch her and you'll regret it.
