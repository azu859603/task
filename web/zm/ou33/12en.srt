1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Get out!

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I'm sorry, my husband. I thought it was you at the door. I really don't know that.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Still pretending, Clara.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
You recognize me just now. Try to shut me out.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
What do you want?

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
You still think she's your wife?

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,100
Let me tell you the truth.

8
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,100
She's not a lame.

9
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:27,100
Her real name is Clara. She's a doctor at the hospital. And also, my ex-girlfriend.

10
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,100
That's not true.

11
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:33,100
Enough. My wife says she doesn't know you. So get off my property.

12
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,100
You're impossible. This woman is a fraud.

13
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:40,100
If you don't believe me, I'll get her medical records from the hospital to prove it.

14
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,700
No. There's no need.

15
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:48,079
I love the woman standing here. No matter what her name is.

16
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,719
What?

17
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,719
Now leave before I call the police.

18
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:54,719
Now!

19
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:03,450
Your hurt. Let's get you fixed up.

20
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:11,680
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:20,569
Did you really mean what you said earlier?

22
00:01:20,569 --> 00:01:24,299
I said a lot of things earlier. What are you referring to?

23
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:27,299
You're referring to.
