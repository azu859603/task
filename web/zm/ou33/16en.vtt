00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.839
We need to talk, my missus.

2
00:00:04.839 --> 00:00:07.299
How's that? Too strong?

3
00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:08.919
Ugh.

4
00:00:08.919 --> 00:00:10.320
Couldn't soften the tone a little bit.

5
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.210
I think that would help.

6
00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.109
Whoa.

7
00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:21.109
For a second, I could have sworn you were my wife, Doctor.

8
00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:24.210
That's funny. You must have the same eyes or something.

9
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.710
So, so flattered. Thank you.

10
00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.309
Is there anything else I can help you with?

11
00:00:28.309 --> 00:00:29.309
No.

12
00:00:29.309 --> 00:00:32.310
I appreciate you helping me with that.

13
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.810
Now I have to go have a good talk with my wife.

14
00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:50.520
Great. You do that.

15
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.920
Sorry. The number you are calling is not available.

16
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.950
Please try again later.

17
00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:58.649
Strange.

18
00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.350
Where could Elaine be?

19
00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.370
Why can't I reach her?

20
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.170
I'll expose that fraud.

21
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:18.040
Only one who won't deceive me.

22
00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.129
Miss Jessie, I personally confirmed it.

23
00:01:21.129 --> 00:01:24.329
The fraud is indeed Clara, not Elaine.

24
00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:27.790
Also, I found proof that the real Elaine is abroad.

25
00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.090
Tell me more.
