00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:19.800
Is this the evidence you were talking about?

2
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:20.859
Yes.

3
00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:22.600
That's lame.

4
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.170
Don't you see?

5
00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:30.600
Okay, here's the deal.

6
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:40.060
You are going to keep pursuing a lane and arrange a meeting with the imposter.

7
00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:47.700
If you can get her to admit her true identity, I'll throw in an extra million as a bonus.

8
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.700
Hmm.

9
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.119
Count me in.

10
00:00:50.119 --> 00:01:01.140
But if I find out you're trying to squeeze money from the imposter behind my back, don't

11
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.020
blame me for being ruthless.

12
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.409
Yes.

13
00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.510
Of course.

14
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.959
I'll be careful.

15
00:01:13.959 --> 00:01:25.840
Go.

16
00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:26.840
What's a lane up to?

17
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.640
Why isn't she answering my calls or messages?

18
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:37.590
As a lane's sick.

19
00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.230
Clara, Director Kirk wants to see you.

20
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:44.290
On my way.

21
00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:45.530
Director Kirk?

22
00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:46.530
It's Clara.

23
00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.540
You want to see me?

24
00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:51.540
Director Kirk.

25
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.519
I'm coming in.

26
00:01:55.519 --> 00:02:05.560
Clara, sit here finally admitting you're not a lane.
