1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,899
What are you doing?

2
00:00:01,899 --> 00:00:03,859
Why are you pretending to be a lane?

3
00:00:03,859 --> 00:00:05,660
Tell me, what's your game?

4
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:08,419
I don't know what you're talking about, just let me go.

5
00:00:08,419 --> 00:00:09,820
Don't know.

6
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:11,300
Let me clarify.

7
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,980
You know, Jessie, right?

8
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:17,750
She came to see me, offered me millions.

9
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:22,140
Lara, if we weren't together for three years,

10
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,420
I would have revealed your identity to her long time ago.

11
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:28,609
Jessie, all right, fine, fine.

12
00:00:28,609 --> 00:00:31,260
I'll tell you, but you have to let me go first.

13
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:36,740
Look, to be honest, I'm a lane stand-in.

14
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:39,060
But she asked me to do it, and she'll be back in a month,

15
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:41,219
and then everything will be resolved.

16
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:45,649
So you don't want to be married to that man?

17
00:00:45,649 --> 00:00:47,810
OK, I'll help you in all the marriage tomorrow,

18
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:48,450
and then you can leave today.

19
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:49,689
Absolutely not.

20
00:00:49,689 --> 00:00:51,689
I am not divorcing Miles.

21
00:00:51,689 --> 00:00:53,409
What did you say to me?

22
00:00:53,409 --> 00:00:56,210
I said that no matter what happens,

23
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:58,729
I am not divorcing Miles.

24
00:00:58,729 --> 00:01:13,760
In this lifetime, he is my one and only husband.

25
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,560
He forced my hand.
