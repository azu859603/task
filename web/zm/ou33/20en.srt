1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,080
So you don't want to be married to that man?

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,080
I know it.

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:10,650
Forcing Miles.

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:13,380
Did you say to me?

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:18,899
That no matter what happens,

6
00:00:18,899 --> 00:00:22,440
In this lifetime he is my only husband.

7
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:26,500
Miles, now you believe me, right?

8
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,500
That woman is not Elaine.

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,259
So what if she isn't?

10
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:37,649
And what if she isn't Miles?

11
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:39,649
She lied to you. Aren't you mad?

12
00:00:39,649 --> 00:00:42,700
Who cares what her name used to be?

13
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,700
She's my wife now.

14
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,740
I must have underestimated this woman.

15
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:49,740
Not only did she deceive Miles,

16
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:52,740
But she also completely enchanted him.

17
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:55,740
If that's a case, then I'll have to.

18
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:56,740
Fine.

19
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,740
If you won't handle this,

20
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:02,659
Then I'll just give this to her according to grandma

21
00:01:02,659 --> 00:01:04,659
And let her deal with that woman.

22
00:01:04,659 --> 00:01:05,659
You wouldn't dare.

23
00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:07,659
Yes, I would.

24
00:01:07,659 --> 00:01:11,530
But if you want to stop me,

25
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:16,920
Then let's make a deal.

26
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:23,590
What do you want?

27
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:31,230
I can't handle a date with you.
