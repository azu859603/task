00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.319
I want a date.

2
00:00:02.319 --> 00:00:09.859
Fine, fine, but promise you won't give those recordings to grandma.

3
00:00:09.859 --> 00:00:30.379
Damn, my house seat.

4
00:00:30.379 --> 00:00:32.979
Since you were created to spend the night with me,

5
00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:35.380
you can't just be about dinner.

6
00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.950
Don't play games with me, Jesse.

7
00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.539
If you're not willing, you can leave right now.

8
00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:49.850
But I will conveniently give the recording to grandma.

9
00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:02.070
Happy?

10
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.689
Wait a second.

11
00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.019
Why am I getting hot?

12
00:01:09.019 --> 00:01:10.620
What's going on?

13
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:17.030
Malzy, are you feeling unwell?

14
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.709
Let me take you somewhere to rest.

15
00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:30.599
Where are we going?

16
00:01:30.599 --> 00:01:32.489
Where are you taking me?

17
00:01:32.489 --> 00:01:34.890
Sorry, the number you are calling is not available.

18
00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.670
Please try again later.

19
00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.099
Still no response from Elaine.

20
00:01:41.099 --> 00:01:45.390
Maybe I should ask for help from Miles?

21
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.239
What would I say?

22
00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:54.329
Mrs. Kiplin, can I help you?

23
00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.489
I'm looking for my husband.

24
00:01:55.489 --> 00:01:57.010
Have you seen him?

25
00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.170
They left for Miss Jesse earlier.

26
00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:00.959
The same urgent.

27
00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:02.849
Didn't he tell you?

28
00:02:02.849 --> 00:02:04.170
Jesse?

29
00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.010
Yes.

30
00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.289
She spoke to Mr. Kiplin, and they left together.

31
00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.689
Jesse, what are you up to now?

32
00:02:10.689 --> 00:02:16.000
Do you know where they went?

33
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.240
I think they went to the Paradise Hotel.
