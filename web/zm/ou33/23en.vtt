00:00:03.089 --> 00:00:04.349
All right.

2
00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:06.400
Don't panic.

3
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.000
If this pig is cheating on you,

4
00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:11.300
you won't even need to lift a finger.

5
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.199
I'll make sure his legs are broken.

6
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.400
Come on.

7
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.039
I'm just so scared.

8
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:20.039
If Miles is unfaithful, I don't know what I'll do.

9
00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:32.460
Jesse, did you drug me just to sleep with me?

10
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:37.280
Miles, I am the only one who deserves to be Mrs. Skipley.

11
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.380
OK?

12
00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:39.719
Look at the impostor.

13
00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.719
I don't care who she is.

14
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.020
I love her.

15
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.509
What did that bitch give you to make you blind to my love?

16
00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:50.119
Love.

17
00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.619
Love, you want to talk about love?

18
00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.320
Love is about trust and respect.

19
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.119
It's not about drugging people to get what you want.

20
00:00:57.219 --> 00:00:58.320
Trust.

21
00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:59.310
Yeah.

22
00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:00.810
Miles, have you forgotten?

23
00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:07.719
She is not the chief, everyone.
