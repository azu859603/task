00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,660
Grandma, yesterday this slut admitted to not being a lane and I recorded it

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,320
listen

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,349
to be honest, I'm

4
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:11,429
Elaine's

5
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:14,949
It's over. She asked me to do it and she'll be back in a month and

6
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:20,429
Sorry grandma reflexes. Miles, are you crazy? Are you really gonna side with her?

7
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:27,170
Why is Miles helping me? Could it be that he already knows everything?

8
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:31,710
Miles, what does Jesse mean by her not being a lane?

9
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:33,939
grandma

10
00:00:33,939 --> 00:00:39,740
Jesse is just very jealous of Elaine and she's doing everything in her power to ruin her name

11
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:45,549
But Elaine has been nothing but kind to you and if she isn't my wife

12
00:00:46,189 --> 00:00:53,359
Who could she be? Okay, that makes sense, but why are you here with her tonight?

13
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,880
Jesse threatened me

14
00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:00,009
She said that if I didn't spend the night with her she would hurt Elaine

15
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,490
Jesse you conniving liar

16
00:01:04,329 --> 00:01:07,349
We've been tried to harm my granddaughter in law

17
00:01:08,269 --> 00:01:21,609
You have to believe me everything I said has been true

18
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:24,799
That bitch isn't a lane

19
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:28,700
Can you prove she deceived my grandson?
