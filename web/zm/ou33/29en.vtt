00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.129
Grandma, something slipped my mind.

2
00:00:24.129 --> 00:00:28.179
Could you remind me when is Miles' birthday?

3
00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:30.879
His birthday?

4
00:00:30.879 --> 00:00:33.579
You don't remember when Miles' birthday is?

5
00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:36.380
Maybe last night was just an act.

6
00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.789
Is she really an imposter?

7
00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:42.030
His birthday is the 23rd next month.

8
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.390
Strange.

9
00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.509
Why is Grandma suddenly asking about this?

10
00:00:46.509 --> 00:00:48.189
And what is his favorite food?

11
00:00:48.189 --> 00:00:49.270
Asparagus.

12
00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:50.829
His least favorite food?

13
00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:51.710
Tomatoes.

14
00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.070
His first car?

15
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:53.950
Aston Martin.

16
00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:55.429
His favorite pet?

17
00:00:55.429 --> 00:00:56.390
Goldby.

18
00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.899
Then one last question.

19
00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.980
Why did you marry Miles?

20
00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:14.980
Because I love him.

21
00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.189
I've always loved him.

22
00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.700
And I swore I would marry no one else but him.

23
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:29.260
But I can't say the real reason.

24
00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.420
She knows Miles so well.

25
00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.980
That can't be faked.

26
00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:34.739
OK, dear.

27
00:01:34.739 --> 00:01:36.939
We'll have a great evening.

28
00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:38.900
Madam, ask for your request.

29
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.659
We have thoroughly investigated Ms. Elaine's background.

30
00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:43.579
Here is her complete file.

31
00:01:43.579 --> 00:02:02.629
Thank you.

32
00:02:02.629 --> 00:02:04.590
I need you to draft a divorce agreement

33
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.909
for me over the next couple of days.

34
00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:08.110
The sooner the better.

35
00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:08.949
Divorce.
