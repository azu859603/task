1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,220
Why does he suddenly want a divorce?

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:05,219
He knows who I am.

3
00:00:05,219 --> 00:00:14,429
Grandma, you seem to have tested my wife multiple times, right?

4
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:19,429
I suppose you're very unhappy with her, right?

5
00:00:19,429 --> 00:00:23,679
Maybe a divorce would make you happy.

6
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:27,120
Is all this because of me?

7
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:33,049
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:33,049 --> 00:00:37,039
I won't interfere in your marriage again.

9
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:44,119
Dear, I can see how much she and Miles truly care for each other.

10
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:46,119
Divorce is a serious matter.

11
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:48,119
You two should talk it out.

12
00:00:48,119 --> 00:01:11,579
Miles, do you really want a divorce?

13
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:35,879
I'm finally afraid.

14
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:37,879
So have you checked it out?

15
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:39,879
I wasn't lying, right?

16
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:44,000
That woman is definitely not a lame.

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Miles was right. You really are out of your mind.

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:55,859
Is Miles protecting Aline again?

19
00:01:55,859 --> 00:02:00,219
I don't know.

20
00:02:00,219 --> 00:02:05,700
Yes, I'll just have to handle it myself.

21
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:29,849
Miles, want a divorce? Not?

22
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:33,300
No, no, no. Don't play with me.

23
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,360
I'm not stupid.

24
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:42,159
You have always kept your distance from me, intentionally avoiding me.

25
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:47,120
You probably never even liked me from the start, did you?

26
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:53,500
So instead of watching you suffer, I figure it's better we just part ways.

27
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:57,139
So go, be free or whatever.

28
00:02:57,139 --> 00:03:03,439
That's not true. Being with you hasn't been tortured.

29
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:10,199
You're not going to stand there and tell me that you're happy to be married to me.

30
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:11,199
Yes.

31
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:27,830
What was that? What did you just say?

32
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:36,250
It's getting late. We should go home.

33
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:42,189
Yeah, yeah, it's late.

34
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:49,860
Hey, in terms of the divorce, I figure we can wait.

35
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:57,500
I actually fall in love with me.

36
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:04,699
Miles, you idiot. I've already fallen for you. A long time ago.

37
00:04:04,699 --> 00:04:17,939
Where are you? There's a lady here by the name of Jesse.

38
00:04:17,939 --> 00:04:21,939
She said if she doesn't see you within the next half hour, she's going to print the orphanage down.

39
00:04:21,939 --> 00:04:23,009
What?

40
00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:28,819
Is something wrong?

41
00:04:28,819 --> 00:04:31,819
Nothing. It has nothing to do with you.

42
00:04:31,819 --> 00:04:44,290
Find out where my wife is going. Make it quick.

43
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:56,600
Miss White, Claire, it's her.

44
00:04:58,269 --> 00:05:03,379
Now you're Clara?

45
00:05:03,379 --> 00:05:07,600
What do you want? It's simple. Go to Miles.

46
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,420
Tell him you're not a lesson!

47
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:21,529
Chop, chop, Claire. If you don't divorce him within an hour, I'll burn this small shitty place.

48
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:25,540
Not that anyone cares.

49
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:38,850
Okay, stop, stop, stop, don't. We'll do it.

50
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:39,850
Any what's going on?

51
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:43,870
Miles, we found her. She went to the orphanage.

52
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:46,959
Jesse's there too.

53
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:49,569
Our suspicion might have figured it out.

54
00:05:49,569 --> 00:05:53,569
Send someone to angel orphanage immediately. Don't let her hurt my wife.

55
00:05:53,569 --> 00:06:05,120
You're back. What happened? You left without saying anything.

56
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,699
Miles, I need to tell you something.

57
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:23,420
The truth is, I'm not a lean.

58
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:26,420
Jesse was right. I'm an imposter.

59
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,420
You said you wanted a divorce.

60
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:34,420
And I can leave, but please don't divorce a lean. I promised her you two would stay married.

61
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:43,449
Say something.

62
00:06:43,449 --> 00:06:47,620
Thank you for telling me.

63
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:51,939
What? Thank you?

64
00:06:51,939 --> 00:06:54,540
You're not mad?

65
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:57,149
Do you want me to be mad?

66
00:06:57,149 --> 00:07:00,279
No, no. Not at all.

67
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:03,279
I'm not a lean. Miles, at all.

68
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:08,279
I'm just someone who married you under false pretenses and now that you know the truth, you should be furious.

69
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:10,279
That would be your normal reaction.

70
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:17,699
I don't care. I don't care.

71
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:23,920
I don't care.

72
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,779
As the person I love is right from me.

73
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:27,779
Claire Hurty.

74
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:31,389
Or Elaine Priestley.

75
00:07:31,389 --> 00:07:33,519
You. I'm in love with you.

76
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:41,339
It was all along.

77
00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:50,939
You're kind of a bad liar, Claire Bear.

78
00:07:50,939 --> 00:07:57,910
What is going on? Tell me everything. I'll explain everything.

79
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:02,350
Okay. Okay. I'll explain. Have a seat.

80
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:03,350
The relation's clear.

81
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:09,910
You're watching this video, eat me, say you have five silly girls.

82
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:12,230
I've known all along that you love him.

83
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:16,230
He was never meant to be my fiancÃ©. He was always meant for you.

84
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:26,769
So, who knew I wasn't Elaine all along?

85
00:08:26,769 --> 00:08:28,310
Yes.

86
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:32,470
And I wasn't the only one lying. You two were in on it together.

87
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:36,240
Yeah, we all lied a bunch. I'm sorry.

88
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:43,460
But the part that is true is that I've loved you since the second I met you.

89
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:50,980
Claire, before I could confess, you had already left the orphanage.

90
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:57,039
So, I thought Elaine was the only way that we could actually have a chance.

91
00:08:57,039 --> 00:09:10,679
And if you don't believe me, feel my heart. It's racing right now.

92
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:14,340
The heart never lies.

93
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:39,169
Claire must have confessed everything by now.

94
00:09:39,169 --> 00:09:42,169
Models must be furious.

95
00:09:42,169 --> 00:09:59,389
What are you doing? What have you done?

96
00:09:59,389 --> 00:10:01,389
What did you do this time, Jesse?

97
00:10:01,389 --> 00:10:07,389
Miles, it was all for you. She is not the real Elaine.

98
00:10:07,389 --> 00:10:09,740
You need to kick her out.

99
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:12,769
Jesse, what's wrong with you?

100
00:10:12,769 --> 00:10:17,960
Those kids have no one. Miss White is their only family.

101
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:21,960
And to get to me, you would have to build innocent kids?

102
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,399
Don't you have a heart?

103
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:28,690
Miles, you let her hit me?

104
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:32,690
Compared to what you just did, a slap in the face is nothing.

105
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:38,309
I've called the police. You're going to jail.

106
00:10:38,309 --> 00:10:43,549
Eddie, get her out of here.

107
00:10:43,549 --> 00:10:54,500
No!

108
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:58,500
I promise. I will never. I'm so sorry.

109
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:19,620
Elaine, what? You want me to marry your fiance in your place?

110
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:23,659
I have my reasons. Just pretend to be me for a month and I'll be right back.

111
00:11:23,659 --> 00:11:25,659
You should be easy to convince him.

112
00:11:25,659 --> 00:11:26,690
Are you sick?

113
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:44,120
I've been so blind. I should have known something was wrong with Elaine

114
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,120
this whole time.

115
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:49,279
Miles, please help me. She's my best friend.

116
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:54,279
Don't worry. I'll get the jail ready. We'll be in Europe this quick as we can.

117
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:55,309
Let's go.

118
00:11:55,309 --> 00:12:10,370
So happy I made it. You're still alive.

119
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:13,370
What are you talking about? Of course I'm alive.

120
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:20,470
Well, then why are you in the hospital? Aren't you supposed to be dying?

121
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:22,470
Isn't that why you tricked me into marrying Miles?

122
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:35,500
I just got a nose job. Who said I was dying?

123
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:40,029
You were just acting so mysterious.

124
00:12:40,029 --> 00:12:44,029
And you practically handed Miles to me on a sofa platter to inherit.

125
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:51,480
With you being you, you would probably end up putting the only person you love in your cross-drawer for the rest of your life.

126
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:59,340
So I decided to help out a little.

127
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,600
Well, thank you, essentially.

128
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,789
That's more like it.

129
00:13:03,789 --> 00:13:08,639
Have you slept with him yet?

130
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,639
Oh my God! How can you even ask that? I thought you were his wife.

131
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:15,639
I've been trying a whole month not to portray you.

132
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:16,639
All right, all right.

133
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:23,399
My bad. Now we can sleep with him any time you want. Enjoy.

134
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:27,070
Okay, we should go. I'll leave it to this.

135
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:28,070
That.

136
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:32,850
Have you a bad?

137
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:43,789
Of course. Hurry up. I don't want to miss my spa time.

138
00:13:43,789 --> 00:14:16,059
I can actually call you my wife.

139
00:14:16,059 --> 00:14:31,600
What? About to hang home.

140
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,559
I was worried about you working late, so I brought snacks.

141
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:44,779
Very kind of you, but I think the only snack I really want is standing right in front of me.

142
00:14:44,779 --> 00:15:53,379
Someone's in the boss's office.

143
00:15:53,379 --> 00:15:54,379
Doll pretend.

144
00:15:54,379 --> 00:15:58,629
And now you know my feet. I'm actually a big bad man.
