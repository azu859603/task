1
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:07,690
Mr. Simpson, he promised property has already been sold.

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,580
What?

3
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:12,580
But I already transferred to three billion.

4
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:15,580
Mr. Simpson, Carter's deceived you.

5
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:20,660
You got to explain?

6
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:23,489
I don't know what happened, Dave.

7
00:00:23,489 --> 00:00:25,489
Can we just get through the wedding first?

8
00:00:25,489 --> 00:00:27,489
You Carter's.

9
00:00:27,489 --> 00:00:28,489
You're all liars.

10
00:00:28,489 --> 00:00:31,489
You'll die alone just like your mother will.

11
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:41,469
Mrs. Simpson, you've been diagnosed with severe depression.

12
00:00:41,469 --> 00:00:44,469
And we're hearing loss continues to worsen.

13
00:00:44,469 --> 00:00:47,700
You may go completely deaf within a month.
