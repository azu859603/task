00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Is there any way to treat it?

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.000
No.

3
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.610
Before you go completely deaf,

4
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.609
I would suggest to spend time with the people that you love,

5
00:00:08.609 --> 00:00:11.609
let their voices be the last ones you remember.

6
00:00:13.609 --> 00:00:22.980
I think I just... I just wanted to hear your voice.

7
00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:25.460
I'm married to cliche.

8
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.159
I'm absurd.

9
00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.380
To believe that the last sound I wanted to hear was your voice.

10
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.070
Yeah, now.

11
00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.070
Stephanie.

12
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.200
What are you doing back in the country?

13
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.939
A little deaf mouse.

14
00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:52.939
You're hearing so awful, isn't it?

15
00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:57.939
I'll never understand why William broke up with me to marry a cripple like you.

16
00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:59.939
He's just too much of a say.

17
00:00:59.939 --> 00:01:03.939
Oh, and he's throwing me a welcome party tonight.

18
00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:04.939
You can come.

19
00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:07.939
Just promise not to play your little victim game.

20
00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:18.799
Why don't you even come?

21
00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:23.680
William hates it when I'm around his friends.

22
00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:34.140
You've only left the country because you got married.

23
00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.620
Three years are almost up.

24
00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.620
I'm going to leave that little deaf wrench.
