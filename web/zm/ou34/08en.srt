00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:05,710
Mrs. Amson, this is the divorce agreement you requested.

2
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:08,710
Please also prepare the transfer documents.

3
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:16,239
Mrs. Amson, are you really going to transfer all of the inheritance Mr. Carter left you to Mr. Amson?

4
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:20,750
Where is it? Are you looking for this?

5
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:24,170
Thank you. Don't be upset.

6
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:28,649
My parents are gone, but I haven't cried.

7
00:00:28,649 --> 00:00:34,679
Are your parents buried there?

8
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:38,960
Lily. Where have you been?

9
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,619
I lost my hearing aid. He helped me find it.

10
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:44,619
Thank you, William.

11
00:00:44,619 --> 00:00:47,619
Lillian is lucky to have met a gentleman such as you.

12
00:00:47,619 --> 00:00:57,659
Let's go. Say goodbye to William.

13
00:00:57,659 --> 00:01:03,399
Yes. Just call me Lillian. I'm not Mrs. Amson anymore.

14
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:05,400
You already gave up the marital property.

15
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:11,099
And now you're giving away your premarital assets. You will have nothing left.

16
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:13,099
I owe him much more than that.

17
00:01:13,099 --> 00:01:26,409
I'm home tonight. I have something to tell you.
