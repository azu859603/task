00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.339
Mr. Sampson, you said you wanted to see me?

2
00:00:03.339 --> 00:00:05.500
Let's get this to my lawyer.

3
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:11.960
Mr. Sampson, you're thinking about buying the Carter group?

4
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.960
But isn't this company the last thing that Mrs. Sampson's father left her when he died?

5
00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.309
Are you really sympathizing with that liar?

6
00:00:20.309 --> 00:00:24.859
No, of course not. I'll get right out of here.

7
00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:34.179
Complete the Carter acquisition as soon as possible.

8
00:00:34.179 --> 00:00:40.090
How do you want to acquire the Carter group?

9
00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.439
Looks like you're not completely deaf.

10
00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:47.439
Yeah, people swindled me out of three billion when we got married.

11
00:00:47.439 --> 00:00:49.500
This time I take it back.

12
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.020
A company is the only thing my father left.

13
00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.079
You know that, right?

14
00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.429
Yeah, I do.

15
00:00:57.429 --> 00:00:59.429
And that's exactly why I want it.

16
00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:07.549
I am. I want a divorce.
