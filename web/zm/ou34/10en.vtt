00:00:02.609 --> 00:00:05.440
What did you just say?

2
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:06.440
What do you want this time?

3
00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:07.440
Money?

4
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.570
A child?

5
00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:10.660
Your father's company?

6
00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.019
Don't be ridiculous, Lillian.

7
00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.019
Your threats don't work.

8
00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:16.019
It's not a threat.

9
00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:18.429
You can have the company if you want.

10
00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:22.510
I just want a divorce.

11
00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.800
If you still love Stephanie, you can be with her.

12
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.219
I'm sending you free.

13
00:00:28.219 --> 00:00:32.229
Just like you've always wanted.

14
00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:34.229
No, don't be ridiculous.

15
00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:36.229
If anyone should ask for a divorce,

16
00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:38.390
it shouldn't be me.

17
00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.829
Who are you to ask for that?

18
00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:46.969
I prepared the papers.

19
00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:47.969
Lillian!
