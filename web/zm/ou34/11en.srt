1
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:06,290
How dare you come back here?

2
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:09,449
Three years of marriage, no heir for William,

3
00:00:09,449 --> 00:00:11,089
and you want a divorce?

4
00:00:11,089 --> 00:00:14,339
How will we have anything if you divorce him?

5
00:00:14,339 --> 00:00:17,460
So you admit, you married me all for money.

6
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,879
It was the only thing you were useful for,

7
00:00:19,879 --> 00:00:21,600
and you screwed it up!

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:36,670
Get out of my house!

9
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:40,000
Oh, and you can finally have a proper drink

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,460
without Lillian here to ruin it.

11
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,759
So where is she?

12
00:00:46,759 --> 00:00:48,039
Back with a family.

13
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:54,020
And that's how it should be.

14
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,500
A disabled woman from a fallen family

15
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,420
could never measure up to you.

16
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:01,420
You've put up with her for three years.

17
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:28,099
That's far more time than she deserved.

18
00:01:28,099 --> 00:01:30,060
Betty, I have nowhere else to go.

19
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,939
Oh, honey, you do not deserve this kind of treatment

20
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:37,180
from that dirt-eating, conniving, evil, parent-less.

21
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,219
Then it's only fitting he's married to a woman

22
00:01:39,219 --> 00:01:42,379
who wants a baby from honey.

23
00:01:42,379 --> 00:01:45,060
Well, as long as you're here, you're a free woman.

24
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:51,219
How are your ears?

25
00:01:51,219 --> 00:01:53,299
Before you go completely, Deb,

26
00:01:53,299 --> 00:01:57,099
I would suggest you spend time with the people that you love.

27
00:01:57,099 --> 00:02:14,009
Let their voices be the last ones you remember.

28
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:16,169
Busy tomorrow night.

29
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:17,889
At the office, I'm interested.

30
00:02:17,889 --> 00:02:20,110
Mind your own business.

31
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:30,150
I don't want to be with that boy, especially on you.

32
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,229
Lily's had it beyond tough growing up.

33
00:02:32,229 --> 00:02:34,110
Her mom treats her like a burden.

34
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:38,419
Mom!

35
00:02:38,419 --> 00:02:41,099
Nobody took her seriously.

36
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:44,250
Lily didn't even know that her mom set her up.

37
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,650
She's loved you all of these years.

38
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:47,849
Even if you can't love her back,

39
00:02:47,849 --> 00:02:50,289
you should still treat her with some kind of respect.

40
00:02:50,289 --> 00:02:51,689
She tell you to play the victim?

41
00:02:51,689 --> 00:02:53,289
Why don't you tell her whatever's going on

42
00:02:53,289 --> 00:02:55,009
in that puny little brain of hers?

43
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:55,930
She deserves it.

44
00:02:55,930 --> 00:03:02,780
It's got nothing to do with me.

45
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,620
Samson is such an asshole.

46
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:05,539
You called him?

47
00:03:05,539 --> 00:03:06,379
Yeah.

48
00:03:06,379 --> 00:03:07,539
I wanted to give him a piece of my mind.

49
00:03:07,539 --> 00:03:12,930
But it just goes in one ear and out the other.

50
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:14,330
You want a divorce?

51
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:16,610
Tomorrow morning, 10 o'clock.

52
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:29,189
Lillian's been out of parents for a while.

53
00:03:29,189 --> 00:03:30,629
Isn't she coming back soon?

54
00:03:30,629 --> 00:03:32,080
She's done.

55
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,800
We're fine for divorce tomorrow.

56
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,689
Congratulations.

57
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:39,580
You're finally free.

58
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:42,360
There's nobody else in between us.

59
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,370
We broke up long before I married Lillian.

60
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:46,930
You've never been in between us.

61
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:52,370
You've carried the Samson legacy alone for all these years.

62
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:54,569
But that's because you haven't had a competent person

63
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:56,300
by your side.

64
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,740
I risked my own life to save them.

65
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,780
You don't have to go through the rest of your life alone,

66
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:04,960
especially when you have people here who care about you.

67
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,360
I will never forget what you did for my family.

68
00:04:07,360 --> 00:05:30,339
Lillian, I don't love you anymore.

69
00:05:30,339 --> 00:05:32,379
Sorry.

70
00:05:32,379 --> 00:05:34,529
We're taking up your time doing work.

71
00:05:34,529 --> 00:05:38,079
Let's just get the soap on.

72
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:47,540
Don't come crying back to me when you regret it later.

73
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:50,300
We can sign the papers after the waiting period.

74
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,339
See you next month.

75
00:05:52,339 --> 00:05:59,560
Take care.

76
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,519
I endured three years of this hellish marriage

77
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:06,129
just for her to end it on her terms.

78
00:06:06,129 --> 00:06:08,259
You want to disappear?

79
00:06:08,259 --> 00:06:22,060
So will the card.

80
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,060
Those Samson operations and the current controlling

81
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,060
shareholder of card room.

82
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:29,000
I now is our merger, the card into Samson.

83
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:39,730
See if you take dependent control, thank you.

84
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:41,879
It was insufferable.

85
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:49,339
How could he do that to you?

86
00:06:49,339 --> 00:06:52,889
Dragged our family business down with you.

87
00:06:52,889 --> 00:07:00,759
I'm so angry.

88
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:04,079
I can't keep burdening you with this.

89
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:10,870
But you aren't.

90
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:17,870
Lillian, why must you punish me?

91
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:23,029
All the news, regulations, those cards

92
00:07:23,029 --> 00:07:28,160
are finally getting what they deserve.

93
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:37,829
That's my cup.

94
00:07:37,829 --> 00:07:48,980
Weeks, and this woman still hasn't come to beg me.

95
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:54,449
Have you found Lillian?

96
00:07:54,449 --> 00:07:55,939
Don won't tell.

97
00:07:55,939 --> 00:07:57,740
Keep an eye on her.

98
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:02,139
I'll be right there.

99
00:08:02,139 --> 00:08:03,100
It's OK, buddy.

100
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,459
I'm fine here.

101
00:08:04,459 --> 00:08:06,639
I can't trouble you anymore.

102
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,000
What is this?

103
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,660
Are you staying in this hobo den?

104
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:15,100
William and I are pretty much divorced.

105
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:18,019
If you want to be with him, go for it.

106
00:08:18,019 --> 00:08:20,649
Leave me alone.

107
00:08:20,649 --> 00:08:22,839
You better not pull any tricks.

108
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:29,699
I don't want to see you near William again.

109
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:34,100
You mind?

110
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,139
I'm talking to you, you deaf bitch.

111
00:08:36,139 --> 00:08:38,500
Let me go!

112
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:47,500
Never finds out you're worth the one who

113
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,139
almost saved his parents.

114
00:08:49,139 --> 00:08:55,509
Stop fucking lying.

115
00:08:55,509 --> 00:08:56,990
I have the scar.

116
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:59,620
I'm the one that saved them.

117
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,419
You know William never loved you, right?

118
00:09:01,419 --> 00:09:19,580
But you could hide from your own mother?

119
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,860
You kicked me out.

120
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,220
Sign this.

121
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:26,580
And Carter is to marry Mr. Beard.

122
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:30,120
Stop on the Carter family.

123
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,240
Isn't D'Angelo the mafia boss?

124
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,919
He's almost 80.

125
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:37,039
You're lucky he doesn't mind getting used up sloppy sex.

126
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:39,429
You're selling me again?

127
00:09:39,429 --> 00:09:42,389
Do you have any empathy at all?

128
00:09:42,389 --> 00:09:44,389
Get ready for the wedding.

129
00:09:44,389 --> 00:09:53,960
I'm doing this again.

130
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,809
You don't have to talk to me like that.

131
00:09:56,809 --> 00:09:57,570
Sign it.

132
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:59,039
No!

133
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,600
I gave you your life.

134
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,799
You owe me.

135
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:06,549
I won't sign!

136
00:10:06,549 --> 00:10:08,549
I didn't ask for this life.

137
00:10:08,549 --> 00:10:10,789
You can take it back.

138
00:10:10,789 --> 00:10:12,610
Are you threatening me?

139
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:17,370
I do.

140
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:43,360
I'm going to be back in three days, if you're still alive.

141
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,769
Lily, is that you?

142
00:10:45,769 --> 00:10:47,879
That's it.

143
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:48,879
Oh, you've been.

144
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:56,389
It's been so.

145
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:58,429
Yeah, I just got back into town today.

146
00:10:58,429 --> 00:11:00,629
Betty was telling me that you got the horse with William

147
00:11:00,629 --> 00:11:02,429
or something.

148
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:03,269
How many drinks have you had?

149
00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:06,429
Is that your first?

150
00:11:06,429 --> 00:11:08,750
Take that.

151
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:14,429
Yeah, let me take you home.

152
00:11:14,429 --> 00:11:30,399
Be careful.

153
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:31,039
Stay right there.

154
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:51,139
I'm going to bring you the goods.

155
00:11:51,139 --> 00:11:55,350
Okay, well, Mr. Sampson.

156
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:55,950
Excuse me.

157
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:59,720
Excuse me.

158
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,850
Wow.

159
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:05,669
You already found a new one?

160
00:12:05,669 --> 00:12:12,330
Hey, so you know, you're still married, so I'm trying to do it.

161
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:30,409
Let's get you right here.

162
00:12:30,409 --> 00:12:33,490
Carter's heiress has humble taste, noted.

163
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:38,340
Carter doesn't exist anymore, and neither does she.

164
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:46,399
Yeah, well, William's gone way too far.

165
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,480
I'm fine here.

166
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,440
Well, hey, if you need anything, just let me know.

167
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,399
I hate seeing him like this.

168
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:55,029
Okay?

169
00:12:55,029 --> 00:13:11,649
Thank you.

170
00:13:11,649 --> 00:13:15,419
Vincent, did you?

171
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:17,440
Vincent, did you?

172
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,600
What are you doing?

173
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,600
You're hurting me.

174
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,200
Our divorce is still processing, and you're already seeing other men?

175
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,200
Who was that guy?

176
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,399
None of your business.

177
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,960
Have you been seeing him behind my back this whole time?

178
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,620
Is that why you wanted a divorce?

179
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:38,850
For three years, I gave up painting, gave up my social life, locked myself in the house,

180
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:41,450
waiting for you to come home every night.

181
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:44,279
What do you think?

182
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:50,340
As long as we haven't gotten the divorce papers, you're still my wife.

183
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,419
So now you want me.

184
00:13:52,419 --> 00:13:57,190
Now that I don't want you, now that some other man cares for me.

185
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:59,559
So what if I do?

186
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:03,570
Wait.

187
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:05,269
Wait a minute.

188
00:14:05,269 --> 00:14:09,179
Please.

189
00:14:09,179 --> 00:14:10,179
Look at me.

190
00:14:10,179 --> 00:14:12,370
I can't handle your chemistry.

191
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:13,370
How are you going?

192
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:42,190
Find yourself a decent place to live.

193
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:45,019
I don't want people saying the Samson's mistreated you.

194
00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:48,370
You'll have your papers.

195
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:52,539
Just a game for you this whole time?

196
00:14:52,539 --> 00:15:15,769
By your solitary thought.

197
00:15:15,769 --> 00:15:18,409
The guy's name is Vincent Miller.

198
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:24,230
This Lillian's childhood friend living abroad for years, he's a well-off independent

199
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:28,549
investor who owns more than half of the galleries and museums in Estonia.

200
00:15:28,549 --> 00:15:30,720
So he's the RTFR team time.

201
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:36,100
I thought he was going to be serious.

202
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,460
Did you hear that?

203
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:40,220
Lillian is getting married again.

204
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:48,259
Where did you hear this?

205
00:15:48,259 --> 00:15:53,779
Lillian's mom demanded 30 million and agreed to marry her after that mob boss, DeAngelo.

206
00:15:55,899 --> 00:16:29,019
I was Carter's pulling that same marriage scam like that.

207
00:16:29,019 --> 00:16:32,730
You're the best in the world, sweetie.

208
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:36,009
Don't let anyone look down on you.

209
00:16:36,009 --> 00:16:37,389
You.

210
00:16:37,389 --> 00:16:38,389
I can't hear you.

211
00:16:38,389 --> 00:17:00,610
What?

212
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:01,610
I don't have a family.

213
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:21,690
Thing to say.

214
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:22,690
Please listen.

215
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:24,130
What do you mean?

216
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:27,809
If I had known you hated this marriage, I wouldn't have married you.

217
00:17:27,809 --> 00:17:32,660
If I had known you couldn't let go of 70, I wouldn't have married you.

218
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:38,940
If I had known that you would never love me, I would have rather died than marry you.

219
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:46,230
I would have never buried such a piece of shit.

220
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:56,460
Lillian, where are you right now?

221
00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:00,900
I'm left to live for life, there's no meaning anymore.

222
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:04,410
Dad, I miss you.

223
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:21,630
I wish I could go back to when you were still around, I wish I could see you.

224
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:34,789
Lillian?

225
00:18:34,789 --> 00:18:35,789
Oh my God.

226
00:18:35,789 --> 00:18:40,019
At least it was side note.

227
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:41,019
You have to go find her.

228
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:42,099
Okay, yes.

229
00:18:42,099 --> 00:18:43,099
I get it.

230
00:18:43,099 --> 00:18:44,519
I'm on it.

231
00:18:44,519 --> 00:19:17,170
Don't do anything stupid.

232
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:18,460
But don't worry.

233
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:49,059
The divorce will definitely go through.

234
00:19:49,059 --> 00:19:50,059
Lily, wake up.

235
00:19:50,059 --> 00:19:51,059
Hey, don't fall asleep.

236
00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:52,059
Who are you?

237
00:19:52,059 --> 00:19:53,690
What are you doing with my daughter?

238
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:55,250
Oh, she's your daughter now?

239
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,450
Where were you when she was trying to kill herself?

240
00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:00,660
Hey.

241
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,259
So she's here too.

242
00:20:02,259 --> 00:20:03,259
You're whoever to this.

243
00:20:03,259 --> 00:20:05,539
You won't get away with this.

244
00:20:05,539 --> 00:20:11,430
How is she?

245
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:12,789
The patient pulled through.

246
00:20:12,789 --> 00:20:25,670
But, is she aware that she's pregnant?

247
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:28,240
No more reckless decisions.

248
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,839
No matter what, you still have me invented.

249
00:20:30,839 --> 00:20:35,500
Thank you.

250
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:41,880
We got you.

251
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,029
Oh, him?

252
00:20:44,029 --> 00:20:45,029
William hates me.

253
00:20:45,029 --> 00:20:46,289
Thank you.

254
00:20:46,289 --> 00:20:51,720
He wouldn't want this child.

255
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,240
Lily and Carter's my friend.

256
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,319
Can you tell me what's wrong with her?

257
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:57,279
We're lucky we got her when we did.

258
00:20:57,279 --> 00:20:59,400
She took too many sleeping pills.

259
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,559
Intentionally?

260
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,900
At least it didn't hurt the fetus.

261
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:04,900
The fetus?
