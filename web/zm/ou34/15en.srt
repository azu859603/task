1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,710
We need to make sure Carter Enterprises has no remaining foothold on us.

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:06,469
I don't want their DNA intertwined with us anymore.

3
00:00:06,469 --> 00:00:18,329
This is Central Hospital, a refinery of the patient leading a Carter.

4
00:00:18,329 --> 00:00:19,489
What's our aim?

5
00:00:19,489 --> 00:00:21,679
The patient has passed away.

6
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:28,190
Sir, what is it?

7
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:37,549
Hey, hey, what happened?

8
00:00:37,549 --> 00:00:41,280
Mr. Samson was rushed into surgery around midnight.

9
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,009
She passed at 2 a.m. due to excessive blood loss.

10
00:00:45,009 --> 00:00:48,530
And then Benson took her away.

11
00:00:48,729 --> 00:00:49,929
Around midnight.

12
00:00:49,929 --> 00:00:57,030
It's just after I left.

13
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,630
Excessive blood loss?

14
00:00:58,630 --> 00:00:59,429
No, no, no.

15
00:00:59,429 --> 00:01:00,829
I don't believe it.

16
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:03,229
Look into all her medical records!
