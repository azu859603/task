00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:05,290
Here are Mrs. Samson's medical records.

2
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:11,419
Complete hearing loss?

3
00:00:11,419 --> 00:00:14,820
How did she go completely deaf?

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:19,320
A severe depression?

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,320
Did I cause this?

6
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,019
But how could she have died?

7
00:00:24,019 --> 00:00:26,019
She was fine just last night.

8
00:00:26,019 --> 00:00:31,019
According to the hospital records, Mrs. Samson attempted suicide the night before Thanksgiving.

9
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:36,020
I overdose while pregnant.

10
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:37,049
Pregnant?

11
00:00:37,049 --> 00:00:53,070
Boss, we found Vincent.

12
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:58,630
Vincent was spotted in flowers here.

13
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:01,630
The plot was purchased by Mrs. Samson a few days ago.

14
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:06,030
So she didn't want to live anymore?

15
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:09,019
Dig it up.

16
00:01:09,019 --> 00:01:11,299
I won't believe she's dead until I see it.

17
00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:13,299
But Boss, she's already dead.

18
00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:15,299
I said dig it up!
