00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.049
Mr. Samson.

2
00:00:02.049 --> 00:00:16.269
Put it back.

3
00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:19.589
Samson's so heartless, why would he dig up your grave?

4
00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:22.460
This just makes me glad I faked my own death.

5
00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:34.750
Look, it was a close call, when you almost died.

6
00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.850
I won't tell you who I am.

7
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:48.299
We're good.

8
00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:51.979
Thank you, Vincent, for helping me.

9
00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:53.820
Ellie, I just want you to be safe.

10
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.700
You know, come with me, and we'll leave all this behind.

11
00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:05.030
I'll take you far from this pain, OK?

12
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.030
Mr. Samson.
