00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Next up, we have an emerald necklace once owned by Miss Sampson,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
bought by her father for her 18th birthday.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,480
Starting bid, five million.

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:14,179
Ten million once.

5
00:00:14,179 --> 00:00:16,179
Fifteen million once?

6
00:00:16,179 --> 00:00:18,179
Mr. Sampson, surely, he's personal expense.

7
00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:20,179
Twenty million once?

8
00:00:20,179 --> 00:00:21,179
Two times?

9
00:00:21,179 --> 00:00:22,179
Draw the bid.

10
00:00:22,179 --> 00:00:23,339
Yes, sir.

11
00:00:23,339 --> 00:00:27,339
So, Miss, please proceed to the back to collect your purchase.

12
00:00:28,339 --> 00:00:32,079
Lillian, do you have any idea how long I've been searching for you?

13
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,179
Excuse me, do I?

14
00:00:34,179 --> 00:00:35,179
Do I know you?

15
00:00:35,179 --> 00:00:39,219
Don't play innocent.

16
00:00:39,219 --> 00:00:40,219
Where have you been?
