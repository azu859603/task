00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.299
I'm sorry, you must have been mistaken for someone else.

2
00:00:03.299 --> 00:00:05.299
I'm here to pay for my necklace.

3
00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:07.370
What are you in charge?

4
00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:09.560
What are you talking about?

5
00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:10.560
Stop it.

6
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.849
I really don't know you.

7
00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:16.129
Do you keep this up or call security?

8
00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.280
You don't know me.

9
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:30.440
Well then, how do you know about this necklace?

10
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.439
My friend said it belonged to my father.

11
00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:34.439
Asked me to buy it back.

12
00:00:34.439 --> 00:00:35.439
Friend of yours.

13
00:00:35.439 --> 00:00:39.340
Is this friend happened to be named Vincent?

14
00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.359
How did you know?

15
00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:43.359
How did I know?

16
00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:44.649
Let go of me.

17
00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:45.649
You're hurting me.
