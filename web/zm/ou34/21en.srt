1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,490
Let go of me, you're hurting me!

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:04,950
This man, he's, he's trying to kill me!

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:08,810
Lillian, do you really not know who I am?

4
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:12,990
Why doesn't she recognize me?

5
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:14,349
Does she have amnesia?

6
00:00:14,349 --> 00:00:17,149
I mean, the hospital said she lost a lot of blood.

7
00:00:17,149 --> 00:00:22,089
So I think if she sustained brain damage, amnesia is definitely possible.

8
00:00:22,089 --> 00:00:25,370
I knew she couldn't have died.

9
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:29,769
Vincent must have taken her away.

10
00:00:29,769 --> 00:00:34,880
So they've been together this whole time.

11
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,899
How could she fake her death?

12
00:00:38,899 --> 00:00:40,340
What's the address?

13
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:43,740
Two days ago, she started staying at the Swan estate.

14
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:44,740
It's good.
