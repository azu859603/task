00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:04.820
What's Vincent here?

2
00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:06.219
What are you talking about?

3
00:00:06.219 --> 00:00:07.219
I'm alone.

4
00:00:07.219 --> 00:00:12.539
Is that so?

5
00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:17.539
Mr. Sampson, this is my hotelver.

6
00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:19.539
You are already in appropriate the auction.

7
00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:23.210
If you're interested in me, at least pursue me properly.

8
00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.850
So does that mean you're single?

9
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:27.850
That's right.

10
00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:36.090
Your hearing's healed?

11
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.119
Then makeup and these clothes?

12
00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:40.979
You don't wear this.

13
00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:42.979
Every woman loves looking good.

14
00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:43.979
Why makeup and dressing up?

15
00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:45.850
Is it a problem?

16
00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.200
Are you for real right now?

17
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.829
Or are you just pretending?

18
00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:53.829
If you hold a grudge, just tell me.

19
00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:56.020
Fix it.

20
00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.469
Is it alive?

21
00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:06.700
You were pregnant back then.

22
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:07.700
I knew it.
