1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:04,799
I never had a child.

2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:05,799
How's little Emma?

3
00:00:05,799 --> 00:00:08,800
Not good. She's still in the hospital.

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,179
Please, my daughter is counting on you, Betty.

5
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:14,179
I can't bring her back with me.

6
00:00:14,179 --> 00:00:17,469
Don't worry. You take care of yourself too.

7
00:00:17,469 --> 00:00:23,059
You sure you want to face William again?

8
00:00:23,059 --> 00:00:25,059
I need the cord blood to save Emma.

9
00:00:25,059 --> 00:00:29,089
Once I get William's burn, get pregnant, I'll leave.

10
00:00:29,089 --> 00:00:39,729
Mr. Sampson, you seem so interested in my past.

11
00:00:39,729 --> 00:00:41,920
Do you ever love me?

12
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,920
Don't change the subject.

13
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,299
Come on.

14
00:00:47,299 --> 00:00:56,820
Don't waste a beautiful night.

15
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,820
You seem to have gotten quite good at seducing.

16
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,140
Is that how you got Vincent?

17
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,490
Faking your own death?

18
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:06,290
It's how you have amnesia?

19
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:10,019
Tricks do you have up your sleeve.

20
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:11,019
I don't drink something to eat.

21
00:01:11,019 --> 00:01:26,459
Now you're just a told to me.

22
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:29,459
Mr. Sampson, you wanted to see me?

23
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:30,459
What can I do for you?

24
00:01:30,459 --> 00:01:33,459
You've been dressing like that for Vincent for the past four years?

25
00:01:33,459 --> 00:01:35,739
Where'd you get the money for the auction?

26
00:01:35,739 --> 00:01:38,480
From Vincent?

27
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,480
What are you talking about?

28
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,480
I earned my own money.

29
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,480
You?

30
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,739
You spent three years as my housewife.

31
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:45,739
I haven't seen you earn a dime.

32
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:47,739
I've been painting since I was four.

33
00:01:47,739 --> 00:01:50,739
My work has earned millions across Europe.

34
00:01:50,739 --> 00:01:59,200
But you still owe me three billion dollars.

35
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,200
I can debate it back, but...

36
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,200
Mr. Sampson.

37
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,390
Please.

38
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:06,390
Have some self-respect.

39
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:10,430
William.

40
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,430
William.

41
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,430
William.

42
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:14,780
William.

43
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:18,120
William?

44
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,699
You're still alive?

45
00:02:19,699 --> 00:02:21,699
I told you she was dead.

46
00:02:21,699 --> 00:02:22,699
Can you leave?

47
00:02:22,699 --> 00:02:25,050
Sure.

48
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:27,300
Just let me know when you're free.

49
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:39,379
That bitch is still alive?

50
00:02:39,379 --> 00:02:47,180
It's so nice to see you back.

51
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:50,039
Excuse me, do I?

52
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:52,139
Do I know you?

53
00:02:52,139 --> 00:03:00,219
I know you're upset that me and William aren't together now, but...

54
00:03:00,219 --> 00:03:02,580
We're getting married soon.

55
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:06,800
And if you had any decency at all, you wouldn't go near him.

56
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,340
Sorry.

57
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,340
What is so funny?

58
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:14,469
When was William ever your man?

59
00:03:14,469 --> 00:03:18,270
Just so you know, people around here?

60
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:20,270
He's still calling me Mr. Sampson.

61
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:30,180
William, William, William, hit me!

62
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,180
I heard everything.

63
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,180
I'm not deaf.

64
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,439
And she wouldn't have hit you if he didn't provoke her first.

65
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:36,439
William, you know how she treats me.

66
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:38,439
Come on, please.

67
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:39,439
What do you want from me?

68
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:40,439
Stay away from her.

69
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:41,439
Don't cause problems.

70
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:43,439
No leave.

71
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:47,710
Just a word of advice.

72
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:51,710
William disappeared with Sampson for four years, and nobody knows what happened to her.

73
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:55,319
Now she's back, and she's claiming amnesia.

74
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:58,020
Just make sure you don't get fooled at.

75
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:10,419
Baby, are you serious?

76
00:04:10,419 --> 00:04:13,419
After this, you will get back with me.

77
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:15,840
You don't want William anymore?

78
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,319
I've already booked the pie ticket.

79
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:19,540
You want to go with me or not?

80
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,220
Wait for me.

81
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:33,860
I'm here to kill you.

82
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:36,430
You're something.

83
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:37,430
I'm here to start.

84
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,620
I'll kill you.

85
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:43,029
She'll run away with me.

86
00:04:43,029 --> 00:04:44,029
She's lying.

87
00:04:44,029 --> 00:04:46,100
I'm Mrs. Sampson.

88
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:50,310
If you kill me, she can bury me with a prison.

89
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:55,889
Promise me.

90
00:04:55,889 --> 00:05:17,350
Then since people took her attacker away.

91
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:24,980
I can't lose you again.

92
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:33,860
Make sure she has the best care.

93
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:44,339
Spare no expense.

94
00:05:44,339 --> 00:05:47,180
Lily, you're awake.

95
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,399
Hey, how are you feeling?

96
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:51,399
Is it still hurt?

97
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:58,250
Steph, she, uh, she tried to kill me.

98
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:01,910
It was Stephanie's ex-boyfriend.

99
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:05,300
But don't worry, I handed him over to the police.

100
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,990
Thank you.

101
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:15,459
Yeah, it was, um...

102
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:16,459
It was William.

103
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:19,290
Yeah.

104
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:20,290
He arrived first.

105
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:22,290
And took you to the hospital.

106
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:24,610
Just ate her all night.

107
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:27,470
And he left about 30 minutes ago.

108
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:39,449
Hey.

109
00:06:39,449 --> 00:06:40,449
Are you okay?

110
00:06:40,449 --> 00:06:42,220
I, uh...

111
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:44,689
And I died.

112
00:06:44,689 --> 00:06:45,689
Again.

113
00:06:45,689 --> 00:06:48,350
I'm here.

114
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:51,149
Don't be scared.

115
00:06:51,149 --> 00:06:52,149
Thank you.

116
00:06:52,149 --> 00:06:57,060
Mr. Sampson.

117
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:01,120
Millian, you haven't really lost your memory, right?

118
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:09,279
You hate me, and that's why you don't want to remember me.

119
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:15,259
Listen, if we divorce, would you marry Vincent?

120
00:07:15,259 --> 00:07:28,870
If I let you go, would you truly be happy?

121
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:35,939
Yes, if I could.

122
00:07:35,939 --> 00:07:46,079
Millian, you're still my wife, remember?

123
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:49,649
For three years.

124
00:07:49,649 --> 00:07:54,540
Did you ever really consider it a marriage?

125
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,540
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

126
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:59,589
Hey, I need a nurse, please!

127
00:07:59,589 --> 00:08:00,589
Now!

128
00:08:00,589 --> 00:08:04,569
You're gonna be okay.

129
00:08:04,569 --> 00:08:05,569
You're gonna be alright.

130
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:06,569
Her hearing was fine.

131
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:07,569
I don't know why she's bleeding.

132
00:08:07,569 --> 00:08:09,569
What do you think hearing loss is easy to fix?

133
00:08:09,569 --> 00:08:11,569
Choose something more of a hearing because of you.

134
00:08:11,569 --> 00:08:13,569
Move out of the way.

135
00:08:13,569 --> 00:08:16,329
Let me do this.

136
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,329
Hey, no, give it to me.

137
00:08:17,329 --> 00:08:18,329
I'm her husband.

138
00:08:18,329 --> 00:08:19,329
Who bullies and abuses his wife?

139
00:08:19,329 --> 00:08:22,449
Don't do it myself.

140
00:08:22,449 --> 00:08:23,449
Mr. Sampson.

141
00:08:23,449 --> 00:08:24,860
Hey.

142
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:32,429
I'll be back.

143
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:34,429
And then this for years.

144
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:35,820
You're gonna be okay.

145
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:44,700
And this condition has worsened.

146
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:56,419
Hey.

147
00:08:56,419 --> 00:08:57,610
What's wrong?

148
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:02,330
Is your hearing again?

149
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:04,330
Take me back to our old house.

150
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:26,440
I just found out that Mrs. Sampson has a child in Estonia.

151
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:33,019
I'm not sure if it's heard of Vincent.

152
00:09:33,019 --> 00:09:43,610
Millian, is our child still alive?

153
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:46,610
Do you remember when you threw a vase at me in the hospital?

154
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:51,269
I was already pregnant, man.

155
00:09:51,269 --> 00:09:52,269
Child didn't make it.

156
00:09:52,269 --> 00:09:54,269
You were the one who killed him.

157
00:09:54,269 --> 00:09:56,940
Millian, I'm so sorry.

158
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:59,649
I'm so sorry.

159
00:09:59,649 --> 00:10:07,950
Please don't hate me.

160
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:34,779
It's happened to China.

161
00:10:34,779 --> 00:10:35,940
Hey.

162
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,379
What's wrong?

163
00:10:37,379 --> 00:10:38,379
Is your hearing again?

164
00:10:38,379 --> 00:10:44,940
Take me back to our old house.

165
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:45,940
I won't have a look.

166
00:10:45,940 --> 00:11:05,139
I just found out that Mrs. Sampson has a child in Estonia.

167
00:11:05,139 --> 00:11:08,139
I'm not sure if it's heard of Vincent.

168
00:11:08,139 --> 00:11:16,000
Millian, is our child still alive?

169
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:25,210
Do you remember when you threw a vase at me in the hospital?

170
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:28,980
I was already pregnant, man.

171
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,899
Child didn't make it.

172
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:32,899
You were the one who killed him.

173
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:35,610
Millian, I'm so sorry.

174
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:38,440
I'm so sorry.

175
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,429
Please don't hate me.

176
00:11:40,429 --> 00:11:46,779
It's happened to China.

177
00:11:46,779 --> 00:12:17,799
I should have said something before I left.

178
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:25,860
Do you have a child in Vincent?

179
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:32,240
Did you get close to me on the purpose?

180
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,899
What do you want?

181
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:42,960
I just couldn't get over you.

182
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:48,320
I wanted to see you once more.

183
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,460
Well, you have me now.

184
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:59,399
Then, are you going to leave me again?

185
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:03,059
You don't understand what I want.

186
00:13:03,059 --> 00:13:08,580
Then tell me.

187
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,580
You still want your love?

188
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:19,399
I start a new life.

189
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:25,750
You still love me, right?

190
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:40,720
Millian, give me a month.

191
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:47,080
If you still don't want me then, I'll let you go.

192
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:50,980
But I'm going to prove to you that I'm better than Vincent.

193
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:56,240
Okay, you have one month.

194
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,139
Just enough time to confirm if I'm pregnant.

195
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:03,100
Same, I know you.

196
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,100
I love you.

197
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:09,899
I want to show you something.

198
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:24,370
These are all my dad's belongings.

199
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:32,580
My dad painted me this.

200
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:38,799
I thought I'd never see it again.

201
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:40,730
I brought it all back.

202
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:44,169
Except for the emerald necklace you took.

203
00:14:44,169 --> 00:14:59,220
Everything is back where it belongs.

204
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,220
Honeymoon trip.

205
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:04,799
I'm going to prove to you in one month that I'm better than Vincent.

206
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:08,799
Is this the childish and ridiculous, like, additive nature of the woman?

207
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:14,110
I'm going to prove to you and make you fall in love with me all over again.

208
00:15:14,110 --> 00:16:14,679
It feels like we really are having a marriage.

209
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:30,070
I was one millimeter away from hitting a major artery.

210
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:40,029
Miss Stephanie's ex-boyfriend is also the one who attacked Mrs. Samson.

211
00:16:40,029 --> 00:16:41,029
You attacked Lillian?

212
00:16:41,029 --> 00:16:42,350
I'm sorry.

213
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:46,980
You will leave me and he just probably wanted to get back at her.

214
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:57,250
I know what she told him, but he tried to kill me.

215
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,250
I will never try to take William from you again.

216
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,250
What a performance.

217
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,250
Look at what you did to me.

218
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:10,220
Did it hurt when you tried to stop yourself?

219
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:15,089
Doug did try to attack Stephanie, but he got nothing out of it.

220
00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:18,150
And Stephanie ended up breaking his leg.

221
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:19,150
See?

222
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:22,539
She knows all of Doug's movements so well.

223
00:17:22,539 --> 00:17:25,539
I knew somebody tried to get him to kill me.

224
00:17:25,539 --> 00:17:30,049
William, did you tell Doug to kill Stephanie?

225
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:41,160
He's Stephanie.

226
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:46,269
Doug, you're not in prison.

227
00:17:46,269 --> 00:17:50,069
William, save me! He's going to try to kill me!

228
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,069
I did not!

229
00:17:51,069 --> 00:17:54,710
Miss you manipulated me to take Lillian.

230
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:57,970
Then try to kill me to kill my quiet.

231
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:04,799
First, I've already booked the flight ticket.

232
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,019
You want to go with me or not?

233
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:12,099
I'm here! He's insane! I don't know who this person is!

234
00:18:12,099 --> 00:18:14,519
I hope you actually die.

235
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:27,150
Vincent, can you get Doug out of jail for me?

236
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:36,559
I did it because I love you. I saved your parents, remember?

237
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,559
You saved William's parents.

238
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:39,559
Of course!

239
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:40,559
You're serious.

240
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:43,559
When they had their car accident, I risked my life trying to save them.

241
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:49,309
But they're trying to save them.

242
00:18:49,309 --> 00:18:57,079
Now, listen, William, 20 years ago, I was the one who tried to save your parents from the accident.

243
00:18:57,079 --> 00:19:04,500
I always thought it was Stephanie. I mean, she has the scar.

244
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:12,559
Don't sleep! The ambulance will be here soon!

245
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:15,579
William, take care of me!

246
00:19:15,579 --> 00:19:19,829
My mommy gets car revision surgery.

247
00:19:19,829 --> 00:19:22,950
So, you can't see it anymore.

248
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:31,079
The girl who called me ambulance is you.

249
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:40,759
What about your scar?

250
00:19:40,759 --> 00:19:46,910
She must have faked it. How could a scar from 20 years ago still look so fresh?

251
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:50,230
I say her record is fake, and my scar is real.

252
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,230
Would you believe me?

253
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:55,500
I need to get out of here.

254
00:19:55,500 --> 00:20:15,500
You knew Stephanie lied. Why didn't you tell me?

255
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,920
You never listened to me.

256
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:21,140
I was appointed telling you.

257
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:23,140
I will never do that to you ever again.

258
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:34,730
Are you okay?

259
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:43,660
Congratulations, Miss Carter. You're pregnant.

260
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:49,410
Really, that's wonderful.

261
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:53,599
Now that our mission's complete, we can go back to Estonia tomorrow and...

262
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:55,599
little Emma and Betty are waiting for us, so...

263
00:20:55,599 --> 00:21:02,460
I'm waiting tomorrow.

264
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:05,809
Hey, hey, don't tell me you're falling for him.

265
00:21:05,809 --> 00:21:11,059
Don't worry, Vincent. I'm not saying I won't leave.

266
00:21:11,059 --> 00:21:17,740
It's just, you might want to know about the child, the father.

267
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:21,829
Don't forget, why Emma got sick in the first place.

268
00:21:21,829 --> 00:21:23,829
He hurt you and Emma right after you got pregnant.

269
00:21:23,829 --> 00:21:26,829
Do you really think that he deserves to be a father?

270
00:21:26,829 --> 00:21:30,470
I've... I've lost my head. Go back to Estonia.

271
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:39,259
Come in and pick you up. I have a surprise for you.

272
00:21:39,259 --> 00:21:47,660
What's going on? Why so fit in?

273
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:52,480
I'm returning your father's business to you.

274
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,539
Just the way you left it.

275
00:21:54,539 --> 00:22:03,789
What I can give you is so much more than what Vincent can.

276
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:24,180
Sorry, babe. I gotta take this. We'll be here back.

277
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:42,630
Well, yeah. If only you had done this sooner.

278
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:55,799
Don't tell me you're having second thoughts.

279
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:57,799
Betty, would you regret missing out on love?

280
00:22:57,799 --> 00:23:00,799
Men only realize what they've lost after it's gone.

281
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:03,799
Think about how much Vincent has done for you.

282
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:04,799
I don't disagree.

283
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:05,799
I don't disagree.

284
00:23:05,799 --> 00:23:06,799
Why are you doing your hardest times?

285
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,799
Maybe you will, you should know about Emma.

286
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:10,859
Emma?

287
00:23:10,859 --> 00:23:16,259
Excellent. Close the deal.

288
00:23:16,259 --> 00:23:18,480
Mr. Samson.

289
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:25,680
I don't disagree, but maybe you will, you should know about Emma.

290
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:29,599
The child is mine.

291
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:31,980
But why wouldn't you tell me?

292
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:37,769
Mr. Samson is leaving for Estonia with Vincent.

293
00:23:37,769 --> 00:23:40,019
They're flight leaves in a few hours.

294
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:41,440
Oh, no.

295
00:23:41,440 --> 00:24:01,140
Lillian, why didn't you tell me about our child?

296
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:08,779
She didn't tell you because you were a terrible husband

297
00:24:08,779 --> 00:24:10,779
and would have been a terrible father.

298
00:24:10,779 --> 00:24:13,359
The child is dead, will you?

299
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:18,529
The child is gone.

300
00:24:18,529 --> 00:24:21,130
Oh.

301
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:25,920
She was four years old and suffered from a severe disease.

302
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:29,430
Our condition worsened last night.

303
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:33,160
Babe, they couldn't save her.

304
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:39,880
Actually, I came back to ask you for a child.

305
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,880
As umbilical cord blood would save her.

306
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:48,559
So, you're pregnant?

307
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:54,829
Lillian, I'm sorry for all the pain I've caused you.

308
00:24:54,829 --> 00:24:59,119
I didn't know how to be a good husband, but I'm, I'm learning.

309
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:04,690
Now, now that we're expecting, let's start over.

310
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:06,690
Okay?

311
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:10,349
Stop making excuses for yourself.

312
00:25:10,349 --> 00:25:12,349
Do you even care about what you put out through?

313
00:25:12,349 --> 00:25:14,349
Oh, you're gonna lecture me.

314
00:25:14,349 --> 00:25:18,890
Enough! Enough!

315
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:21,819
It's my fault, Lillian.

316
00:25:21,819 --> 00:25:24,809
But it's all over now.

317
00:25:24,809 --> 00:25:32,869
Lillian, come home with me, please.

318
00:25:32,869 --> 00:25:34,869
Where is that? The Samson Mansion?

319
00:25:34,869 --> 00:25:39,150
It's never been my home.

320
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:44,220
For three years of marriage, you gave me the cold shoulder.

321
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:47,819
You never once looked at me.

322
00:25:47,819 --> 00:25:50,400
You looked Stephanie bully me.

323
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,400
You took the Carter group to get back and you think

324
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:58,990
just saying it's over will make them disappear.

325
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:01,059
Goodbye, Mr. Samson.

326
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:05,269
Lillian, do you really not love me anymore?

327
00:26:05,269 --> 00:26:11,990
I've been over you for a long time.
