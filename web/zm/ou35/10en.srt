1
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:24,690
Mrs. Evans, who is Hermione, really?

2
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:26,519
That man who picked her up,

3
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:29,820
seemed important.

4
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:30,859
No money.

5
00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:34,020
She's just some community college grad.

6
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,740
She seduced Chris and ran off with another man.

7
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,259
Lucy's being kind not to press charges,

8
00:00:41,259 --> 00:00:43,179
but you need to fire her.

9
00:00:43,179 --> 00:00:44,780
It's okay, Mrs. Evans.

10
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:49,869
Chris is just feeling hurt and betrayed by his assistant.

11
00:00:49,869 --> 00:00:51,579
Don't worry about me.

12
00:00:51,579 --> 00:00:58,570
You're too kind.

13
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:02,380
Plus, since Ms. Brown is in pressing charges,

14
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:04,180
should Hermione return to work?

15
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:07,620
Yes, please have Hermione in the office tomorrow.

16
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:13,420
Cool.

17
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:18,629
Wait, her number is disconnected.

18
00:01:18,629 --> 00:01:19,469
What?
