00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:04.570
Our entire tech staff is here and we need to stop this press conference immediately.

2
00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:05.370
Why?

3
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.169
Ms. Evans has always been concerned about impostors pretending to be Dr. T, so why don't we just let loose see?

4
00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:14.050
Prove herself right here right now in front of our media friends.

5
00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:15.769
Ooh, she's not wrong this time.

6
00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:19.309
We've intended to reveal her identity today.

7
00:00:19.309 --> 00:00:22.589
Why not give a live demonstration?

8
00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:27.579
I'd barely pass computer science. How am I supposed to counteract?

9
00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:30.059
She must have set me up, bitch.

10
00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.780
No problem. I will just activate my counter-hack defense.

11
00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:47.460
Defense successful.

12
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.460
Lucy has proven herself today and anyone claiming to be Dr. T from now on

13
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.579
please report to our legal department.

14
00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.140
We at LM take a slander to our people seriously.

15
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.739
Oh, that was close. Thanks for the authorization.

16
00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.500
Dearest Hermione, you just helped me confirm I'm Dr. T.

17
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.260
Something's wrong. Dr. T, look at this.
