00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160
So what if you're a Garcia?

2
00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.240
You're just a stepping stone on my way up.

3
00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.120
If anyone doubts the Garcia engine's capabilities,

4
00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.519
they are welcome to test it out at any time, but for right now,

5
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.880
let's take a look at Ellen's Dr. T.

6
00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.080
See how she handles this.

7
00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:16.640
And you better hurry.

8
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.079
Lucy, because at this rate,

9
00:00:18.079 --> 00:00:20.399
Ellen will be bankrupt in half an hour.

10
00:00:20.399 --> 00:00:21.199
Not even a hundred.

11
00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:22.399
Dr. T's could save it then.

12
00:00:22.879 --> 00:00:25.199
Lucy, we need to save ourselves.

13
00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.079
The Garcia family is not our concern right now.

14
00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:29.120
Oh, she's so right.

15
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.039
Lucy, and also at this point,

16
00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:32.640
even if you do manage to marry Chris,

17
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.840
all you'll inherit is debt.

18
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.840
Dr. T, we need you.

19
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:36.159
Please.

20
00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.500
John, project Lucy's screen,

21
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.500
and live stream the Dr. T's counterhack process, please.

22
00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:45.700
Copy that.

23
00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:51.859
You have a lot of faith in your fiance.

24
00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:56.670
You got Dr. T.

25
00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.929
Thank you.

26
00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.659
Dr. T, you can begin.

27
00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:11.620
Dr. T, Dr. T, Dr. T, Dr. T, Dr. T, Dr. T.

28
00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:12.579
Why did this bitch die?

29
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.579
Why is she even here?

30
00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:15.939
I can't be exposed.

31
00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:16.420
Not now.

32
00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.980
I can't go back to being nothing.

33
00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.340
I need to find a way.

34
00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.060
What's wrong, Lucy?

35
00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.569
Oh, or are you just impersonating Dr. T?

36
00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:26.060
Nonsense.

37
00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.659
The hacker is inside the building.

38
00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:29.579
So any harsh movements,

39
00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.340
and I could destroy critical data,

40
00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.269
I will use Dr. Quentin's anti-virus robot.
