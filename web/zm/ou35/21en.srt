1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,160
She did it.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,419
She did it.

3
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:05,360
The company's safe again.

4
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:09,740
Wait, so Ms. Garcia's Dr. T, and Ms. Brown lied about it.

5
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:10,939
Looks that way, doesn't it?

6
00:00:10,939 --> 00:00:12,570
That's nonsense.

7
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:15,720
It was my auntie.

8
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,719
OK.

9
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:20,640
Quentin's depend system is super outdated.

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,960
If you want me to upgrade it for you,

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,719
it's going to cost you a fortune.

12
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:28,329
Hmm.

13
00:00:28,329 --> 00:00:29,329
OK.

14
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:34,590
No, I mean a fortune.

15
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,070
You don't think that I can afford it?

16
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:39,030
$1 billion.

17
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:39,950
$1 billion?

18
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:41,549
Have you lost your mind?

19
00:00:41,549 --> 00:00:43,509
Dr. Quentin's was only $10 million.

20
00:00:43,509 --> 00:00:46,750
The delay you caused already cost the company $1 billion?

21
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:47,869
You know what actually wasn't done yet?

22
00:00:47,869 --> 00:00:50,030
I want $1 billion.

23
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:56,899
Plus, a public apology from these two.

24
00:00:56,899 --> 00:00:58,859
Why should I apologize to you?

25
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:00,539
Oh, because if I don't upgrade the server,

26
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:05,689
the virus will continue to attack LM until it just explodes.

27
00:01:05,689 --> 00:01:07,170
Do you think I'm new to this?

28
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,170
The defense is already working.

29
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:10,769
I could hire global talent.

30
00:01:10,769 --> 00:01:12,209
I'm sure somebody will be up for it.

31
00:01:12,209 --> 00:01:13,060
OK.

32
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:18,040
But then you'll be responsible when, not if, when,

33
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,260
LM goes bankrupt.

34
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:23,819
System upgrade failed.

35
00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:25,819
Main server under attack.

36
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:27,420
What is happening?

37
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,540
The outdated system has fallen apart.

38
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:30,659
We are under attack.

39
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:34,060
Mrs. Evans, you need to apologize now.

40
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:37,049
Do you really want to watch LM go to zero?

41
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:38,049
Her money?

42
00:01:38,049 --> 00:01:38,810
Yes.

43
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:41,340
I was wrong.

44
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,939
I apologize.

45
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,650
What about you?

46
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:49,049
Lucy.

47
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:50,049
Apologize.

48
00:01:50,049 --> 00:01:51,090
Clock's ticking.

49
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:53,909
I mean, Lucy.

50
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:55,109
Sorry.

51
00:01:55,109 --> 00:01:56,870
I just, I couldn't quite hear you.

52
00:01:56,870 --> 00:02:07,439
I'm sorry.

53
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,439
2 billion.
