00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.879
But what if even after the wedding, she still doesn't give up?

2
00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:05.719
Hermione has too much pride.

3
00:00:05.719 --> 00:00:09.000
Trust me, when Chris is married to me, she'll back up.

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.000
What if...

5
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.189
To be brutally honest, Mrs. Evans,

6
00:00:13.189 --> 00:00:15.470
if I don't marry Chris soon,

7
00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:19.390
even if Hermione stops digging,

8
00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:24.280
I'm afraid I won't be able to keep the secret for much longer.

9
00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.199
Are you threatening me?

10
00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:29.100
I didn't want it to have to come to this.

11
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.619
But the reason I'm in this mess is because of you.

12
00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:34.049
Fine.

13
00:00:34.049 --> 00:00:36.570
I'll make sure Chris marries you soon,

14
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.539
but that child can't stay.

15
00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:44.340
You're baby's healthy.

16
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.659
You can put your mind at ease, all right?

17
00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:48.780
What I want you to do is wait here,

18
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.780
and I'm gonna go get the medication, okay?

19
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.100
Thank you.

20
00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:05.609
So, even though my doctor Tila was exposed,

21
00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:07.980
I'm still Mrs. Evans' favorite.

22
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.299
Guess what?

23
00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.159
Chris and I are getting married soon.

24
00:01:12.239 --> 00:01:13.239
All right, Mel.

25
00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:17.890
Don't swear if you cause a miscarriage,

26
00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.049
I'll make sure you lie in prison for murder.

27
00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:24.129
You know, I feel so bad for that baby.

28
00:01:24.129 --> 00:01:26.450
Is that a liar for a mother?

29
00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.620
You think you know Chris, don't you?

30
00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.780
You think we start seeing each other after the engagement?

31
00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.090
Wrong!

32
00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.079
Our baby is four months old.

33
00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.000
Like it or not?

34
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.299
At the end of the day, he picked me over you.

35
00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:43.909
Tose you?

36
00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:44.750
Keep dreaming.

37
00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:54.739
I walked away from him.

38
00:01:54.739 --> 00:01:56.980
Four months pregnant?

39
00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:01.170
Chris was with me non-stop on a project four months ago.

40
00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.489
How did he have time to father a child with Lucy?

41
00:02:04.489 --> 00:02:05.930
And I was in charge of his schedule,

42
00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.500
as every minute of every day was accounted for.

43
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.340
Her mindy?
