00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:15.339
Am I any didn't the doctor tell you to stay in bed married soon. You're rushing out to go. Mary Lucy

2
00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:17.839
Let's go

3
00:00:17.839 --> 00:00:24.839
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I didn't think about I'm gonna need a doctor. No, okay, it hurts

4
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.940
But I would feel much better if you're me

5
00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:33.990
Thank you. I miss you

6
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.079
That's enough

7
00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.810
What if your mom or fiance walks in? I don't need that kind of drama. Okay. She's not not your fiance

8
00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.359
She's four months pregnant. I'm not stupid

9
00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:51.770
You cheated on me. You're revolting

10
00:00:52.369 --> 00:01:06.019
Our baby is going to be blessed her mighty

11
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.379
But first when you take out some obstacles along the way

12
00:01:14.349 --> 00:01:25.060
Hello, I don't have much time. So what is the leaf?

13
00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:31.140
I've got a list of all the names from the clothing store plus I've got all the camera footage for you

14
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.590
I gotta say that your fiance is a little suspicious bro. Hello

15
00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:38.709
Yeah, I'll be right there

16
00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:56.469
Chris you forgot your money. That is so good to see you. I do you have the info by Esper. Oh, it's good to see you too. I got you

17
00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:02.750
Yeah, I've got everything you need. I've got the um Brown's family financials for the past two years plus

18
00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.510
I've got a Lucy's itinerary for the past six months now

19
00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:12.349
I I got to ask if Lucy's Chris's fiance, I mean, why are you both investigating her?

20
00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:27.449
I was investigating her Henry, please stay out of this

21
00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.310
What didn't you declare her your eternal assistant at the press conference?

22
00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:46.180
You know what? I am not interested in getting involved. Oh, please stay out of this matter with Lucy

23
00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:49.500
And you stay out of ours

24
00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:55.729
Chris buddy

25
00:02:55.729 --> 00:03:02.620
Staring my fianceing off a lot should it be jealous fiance? Did she agree to that?

26
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.610
Well, no, but she will in your dreams

27
00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:23.289
See both the Evans and the Browns are not some old alliance that goes back generations the relationship only started three years ago

28
00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:26.439
Well, that's why dad

29
00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.400
licensed tea

30
00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.400
We can control the smaller companies

31
00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:34.680
Right, I just don't know why they decided to claim to be dr. D

32
00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.949
Seems strange

33
00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:40.870
Why would the Evans back a failing company like the Browns?

34
00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:59.819
Why do you still care? You still have a thing for Chris? Oh, no, no, no, he just saved my life

35
00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:04.849
I'm trying to repay the favor then we'll be even sure sure

36
00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.000
Still

37
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.599
Why would he risk his life to save you?

38
00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:18.060
Surprising I thought he didn't care. He's just like that

39
00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:21.379
He saved me a party three years ago. That's what I felt for him

40
00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:27.810
But I'm not gonna make that mistake again. This cannot all be a coincidence

41
00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:41.550
Lucy, what are you up to Daniel? I can take care of getting myself home

42
00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.189
So you don't have to follow me around all day, okay? Are you sure?

43
00:04:45.209 --> 00:04:46.250
Absolutely

44
00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.670
Well, take care of yourself and the little baby

45
00:04:50.509 --> 00:05:09.199
How are you doing here? Oh, oh, don't tell me you ran out of places to squat now that everybody knows you're not the tech genius

46
00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:13.310
You claim to be here to tell you in person

47
00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.189
That Chris and I have set a date for our wedding

48
00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:19.550
So Miss executive assistant

49
00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:21.600
Eris

50
00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:22.959
Dr. T

51
00:05:22.959 --> 00:05:25.060
None of it matters

52
00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.180
You'll always be the one not chosen

53
00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.220
Please

54
00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.439
To me, you're not even competition

55
00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:35.310
You'd be nothing without your rich family

56
00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:38.329
What do you have to be proud of?

57
00:05:38.329 --> 00:05:40.329
Now I'm only gonna say this one time

58
00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:49.290
Get lost Lucy. I'm just here giving out our invitation leave

59
00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.910
Unless you're here to

60
00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:58.699
Cancel the wedding. I'm leaving

61
00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:06.769
Did she do anything to you?

62
00:06:06.769 --> 00:06:13.060
For our families

63
00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:24.879
There is no such thing as rumors

64
00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:27.259
Leave the truth

65
00:06:27.259 --> 00:06:32.850
Mercy has don't raise mistresses

66
00:06:34.459 --> 00:06:35.699
Leave

67
00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:40.509
No

68
00:06:40.509 --> 00:06:45.920
You have never been a mistress and you never will be

69
00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:50.910
Not a mistress

70
00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:52.910
You're engaged to someone else

71
00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:55.709
What would you call that? What does that make me?

72
00:06:55.709 --> 00:06:58.029
I mean you sure treat me like I'm a mistress

73
00:06:58.029 --> 00:07:01.060
Okay, you think they're right to do that?

74
00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:03.220
Oh, listen

75
00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:03.939
Now get out

76
00:07:03.939 --> 00:07:05.540
Listen

77
00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:07.939
I will give you every single thing that you have ever wanted

78
00:07:08.819 --> 00:07:11.600
But not yet

79
00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:12.560
I'm a Garcia

80
00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:15.060
I already have everything

81
00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:16.180
I don't need you

82
00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:19.629
Remind me

83
00:07:19.629 --> 00:07:22.269
In the coming days there's going to be a big surprise

84
00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:25.329
Whatever you hear or see

85
00:07:25.329 --> 00:07:26.800
Don't believe it

86
00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.560
Because when that curtain drops

87
00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:32.610
I'm going to give you every single thing

88
00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:34.529
That you have ever wanted

89
00:07:34.529 --> 00:07:38.560
I'm interested

90
00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:45.089
Need to be interested

91
00:07:46.769 --> 00:07:48.209
Guess I want to give it to you

92
00:07:52.029 --> 00:07:56.990
Today LMCEO Chris Evans is marrying his fiancÃ© Lucy Brown

93
00:07:56.990 --> 00:08:00.110
This grand event will be broadcast live globally

94
00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:02.910
Why are you torturing yourself?

95
00:08:03.629 --> 00:08:05.310
It's tacky and it's boring

96
00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:14.100
Make it not boring

97
00:08:15.949 --> 00:08:16.910
Let's go watch it live

98
00:08:17.709 --> 00:08:19.069
You want to go to the wedding

99
00:08:19.709 --> 00:08:21.709
You get tickets to a show you might as well sit front row

100
00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:27.389
I'm Henry

101
00:08:27.389 --> 00:08:29.019
Um

102
00:08:29.019 --> 00:08:31.579
I am the host and officiant of this

103
00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:33.950
What should we call this?

104
00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:35.950
A romantic union

105
00:08:36.509 --> 00:08:37.549
But more importantly

106
00:08:38.269 --> 00:08:41.070
A financial event that will for sure move the market

107
00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:46.129
Mr Evans

108
00:08:47.059 --> 00:08:48.179
You're a low-key guy

109
00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:51.539
Why do you feel the need to broadcast this live?

110
00:08:52.419 --> 00:08:53.220
Well

111
00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:55.539
I have a surprise

112
00:08:56.259 --> 00:08:57.539
For the bride

113
00:08:57.539 --> 00:08:58.580
A surprise

114
00:09:00.639 --> 00:09:02.159
You must really love her don't you

115
00:09:03.419 --> 00:09:04.860
I mean after all

116
00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:08.139
When she pretended to be Dr. T you you forgave her

117
00:09:08.139 --> 00:09:08.700
Good man

118
00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:11.470
Now for the bride

119
00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:13.710
How do you feel that Chris did all of this for you?

120
00:09:14.429 --> 00:09:15.710
Over the moon happy

121
00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:18.820
God never forsakes his believers

122
00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:19.460
Well

123
00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:21.539
I think it's time to say this

124
00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:25.059
Do you take this man

125
00:09:26.559 --> 00:09:28.220
To be your husband

126
00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:28.779
I do

127
00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:37.460
Wait

128
00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:39.379
Chris has a smile so as the wedding began

129
00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:41.940
I seriously doubt he loves Hermione

130
00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:42.980
Not Lucy

131
00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:53.039
You're not welcome here you need to leave now

132
00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:55.220
Oh really

133
00:09:55.220 --> 00:10:01.279
Mother

134
00:10:01.279 --> 00:10:04.899
She actually is my special guest

135
00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:15.950
Now I promised you a show

136
00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:17.789
And I see if you're the best seat in the house

137
00:10:19.139 --> 00:10:19.860
What's happening?

138
00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:22.580
Are they changing brides or something?

139
00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.399
Have you lost your mind?

140
00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:28.159
What are you doing?

141
00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.240
Now I told you you were not a mistress

142
00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:33.039
And you never were

143
00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:34.559
Now

144
00:10:35.149 --> 00:10:36.029
Let me prove it to you

145
00:10:37.659 --> 00:10:41.970
John

146
00:10:42.049 --> 00:10:44.049
I've memorized Mrs. Evans route

147
00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:46.190
You pretend to rob her

148
00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:48.029
I'll step in and stop it

149
00:10:48.029 --> 00:10:50.350
That's how we'll get close to the Evans family

150
00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:52.029
And we'll be set for life

151
00:10:52.669 --> 00:10:54.110
Go get him tiger

152
00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:56.990
That was three years ago when she saved me from robbery

153
00:10:59.899 --> 00:11:00.860
You fooled me

154
00:11:01.419 --> 00:11:03.500
I trusted you and you played me

155
00:11:04.879 --> 00:11:06.399
I'm calling the cops

156
00:11:06.399 --> 00:11:09.389
AI generated it's all fake

157
00:11:10.429 --> 00:11:12.029
Probably from the Garcia family

158
00:11:12.929 --> 00:11:14.370
She's just jealous

159
00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:16.049
That I'm about to marry Chris

160
00:11:17.039 --> 00:11:18.159
If the video's fake

161
00:11:21.409 --> 00:11:22.210
Then who's that guy?

162
00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:25.940
You used me Lucy

163
00:11:26.799 --> 00:11:28.799
I helped you get close to Mrs. Evans

164
00:11:28.799 --> 00:11:30.320
And you promised me a cut

165
00:11:31.039 --> 00:11:32.559
And then you sent me away overseas

166
00:11:32.559 --> 00:11:33.759
And tried to help me kill

167
00:11:33.759 --> 00:11:34.720
You sure you don't know him?

168
00:11:35.279 --> 00:11:36.559
No I don't know him

169
00:11:36.559 --> 00:11:37.759
He's just a criminal to me

170
00:11:37.759 --> 00:11:39.120
Oh you know me

171
00:11:40.139 --> 00:11:44.460
I recorded even when you had me fake the rape attempt

172
00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:45.659
Attempt on Mrs. Evans

173
00:11:46.139 --> 00:11:48.220
Even then baby you're carrying his mind

174
00:11:48.779 --> 00:11:51.379
Shut your mouth

175
00:11:51.379 --> 00:11:53.539
I supported you for all these years

176
00:11:53.539 --> 00:11:54.899
Feeling guilty?

177
00:11:54.899 --> 00:11:58.179
For almost sacrificing my son's happiness for you

178
00:11:58.820 --> 00:11:59.700
Feeling guilty?

179
00:12:00.259 --> 00:12:04.029
You were just scared that I was going to expose you for your past

180
00:12:04.029 --> 00:12:05.149
The rape?

181
00:12:05.149 --> 00:12:05.870
You!

182
00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:06.269
You!

183
00:12:06.269 --> 00:12:06.669
Mother?

184
00:12:07.309 --> 00:12:07.789
Let it go

185
00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:11.809
The law will handle her

186
00:12:14.429 --> 00:12:15.149
Sir?

187
00:12:15.149 --> 00:12:29.419
Do you believe me now?

188
00:12:29.419 --> 00:12:36.179
Maybe

189
00:12:36.179 --> 00:12:40.590
Well

190
00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:41.230
Her mighty

191
00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:45.440
And you know I don't care if you're

192
00:12:46.159 --> 00:12:47.360
An assistant

193
00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:49.519
Or a billionaire heiress

194
00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:51.779
I've always loved you and

195
00:12:54.029 --> 00:12:54.830
And only you

196
00:12:54.830 --> 00:13:04.580
Will you marry me?

197
00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:22.450
You have an executive assistant?

198
00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:24.480
Oh you are

199
00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:29.950
And think you might do
