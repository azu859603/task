1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:05.209
Thank you so much, Olivia.

2
00:00:05.209 --> 00:00:08.210
You saved Will's life, he's doing much better.

3
00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:14.320
I want you to do me another favor.

4
00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:15.320
Mary Will.

5
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.320
And be my granddaughter-in-law.

6
00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.539
What?

7
00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:23.539
Miss Foster, that's not how people say thank you.

8
00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:27.089
You know, I have to go.

9
00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:28.089
Stop!

10
00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:29.089
People light!

11
00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:30.089
God, they're overreacting.

12
00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:32.090
I'm so sorry, Olivia.

13
00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.090
But please, let me finish.

14
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.250
Will is a good man.

15
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.250
He took over the family business at 18,

16
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.250
and took it to new heights.

17
00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:49.500
The company's pocket value is now over a trillion dollars.

18
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.500
I mean, that is really impressive, Mrs. Foster.

19
00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:00.420
Look, I've heard stories about the Foster's youngest grandson,

20
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.420
that he's quite the ladies' man.

21
00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.420
And I'm not really in a min like that, so.

22
00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.420
Uncense, Will is not like that at all.

23
00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.420
Your grandmother is in the hospital, right?

24
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.420
And you are still in law school.

25
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.859
If you bury my grandson,

26
00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:21.859
you and your family will always be well taken care of.

27
00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:24.920
Take this, will you?
