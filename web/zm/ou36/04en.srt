1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,750
Okay, I will marry Will.

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:22,129
Is that it?

3
00:00:22,129 --> 00:00:25,129
No, yes, Gary will take care of the rest.

4
00:00:25,129 --> 00:00:28,129
He's a licensed minister.

5
00:00:28,129 --> 00:00:31,350
Don't worry about it.

6
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:35,979
I'm looking forward to officially meeting Mr. Foster.

7
00:00:35,979 --> 00:00:36,979
Bye-bye.

8
00:00:36,979 --> 00:00:46,950
She got the surname wrong.

9
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:49,950
She obviously thinks that your maiden name is Will's last name.

10
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,109
Oh, no problem.

11
00:00:52,109 --> 00:00:55,109
She'll find out afterwards. Where is Will?

12
00:00:57,109 --> 00:01:03,659
Mary, a woman I don't even know.

13
00:01:03,659 --> 00:01:06,489
It's never gonna happen.

14
00:01:06,489 --> 00:01:09,489
Head to the airport. My jet's waiting.
