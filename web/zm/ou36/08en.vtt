00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
It's you?

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Broker?

3
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
You don't know why I've had these shoes?

4
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Trust me, you're gonna need her.

5
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Olivia is a killer. You'll like her.

6
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.769
Why would I need it?

7
00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:13.769
That's cool.

8
00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.769
I'll leave the two of you to talk.

9
00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:19.539
You'll see why I thought I should be perfect for you.

10
00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:24.300
Oh my god. Does he already know that I'm a lawyer?

11
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.300
I shouldn't have lied to him earlier.

12
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.460
I can do this.

13
00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.460
Hi, Mr. Hart. So great to see you again.

14
00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:32.460
Tonight.

15
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.350
So, what can I do for you?

16
00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.280
Do.

17
00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.280
For me?

18
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.280
Yes.

19
00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.439
Why don't we start with, how long have you been married?

20
00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:47.240
You know I'm married.

21
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.240
And you're still?

22
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.240
Mr. Carter, he...

23
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.240
No, no, no.

24
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.240
So Lawrence is your client too?

25
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:59.240
Yes. He was really anxious about getting married, so he called me.

26
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.369
This is unbelievable.

27
00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:03.369
Okay, well I know it sounds unusual, but I've been practicing for a very long time.

28
00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:05.370
And all of my clients are very satisfied.

29
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:06.370
That's enough.

30
00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.370
You don't believe me.

31
00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.939
Well, I can show you.

32
00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.099
Show me.

33
00:01:13.099 --> 00:01:14.390
How?
