00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.109
Well, how about we start with the trial run?

2
00:00:03.109 --> 00:00:05.110
You know, just like a few hours.

3
00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:06.110
You charged by the hour?

4
00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.109
Well, I have fixed rates along with hourly rates.

5
00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:11.109
It just depends on whatever works best for you.

6
00:00:11.109 --> 00:00:12.109
Whatever works for me?

7
00:00:12.109 --> 00:00:13.109
Mm-hmm.

8
00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:14.109
This is insane.

9
00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:18.820
Oh, I should have lied to him.

10
00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:27.480
But going Olivia, I know you've ruined everything.

11
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.480
Hello?

12
00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.929
Mrs. Foster?

13
00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:31.929
Will's back.

14
00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:32.929
Tomorrow night.

15
00:00:32.929 --> 00:00:36.380
Um, yeah, yeah, I, uh, I'll be there.

16
00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:37.380
I'll be there.

17
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.740
Oh, my God.

18
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:47.859
I cannot believe my jerk-ass husband is back after five years.

19
00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:51.079
So, how to go with Olivia?

20
00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:53.079
She's top-notch, right?

21
00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:54.079
Really knows her stuff.

22
00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:55.079
You're her client, too?

23
00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.619
How else would I recommend her to you?

24
00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:59.619
Don't ever do that again.

25
00:00:59.619 --> 00:01:03.920
The hell?

26
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.920
He said you needed a divorce lawyer.

27
00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.920
She's really good at drafting pre-noves.

28
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.239
Grandma?

29
00:01:14.239 --> 00:01:16.390
My wife?

30
00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.260
Okay, I'll be back.
