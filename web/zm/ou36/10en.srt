1
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:05,280
You want a divorce.

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:09,369
Grandma, I told you.

3
00:00:09,369 --> 00:00:11,429
I don't even know her.

4
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:12,429
We have no connection.

5
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:15,070
I'm gonna hire a divorce lawyer.

6
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:19,070
Five years ago, if it wasn't for Olivia, you'd be dead.

7
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:21,070
Olivia? Isn't that?

8
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:23,070
She has the same name as my wife.

9
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,390
She can have whatever she wants.

10
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:28,460
Money, the house, the company, everything.

11
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:31,769
But love and marriage are off the table.

12
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:34,770
And as for the killers from five years ago,

13
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:38,179
I know who they are now, and they won't get away with it.

14
00:00:38,179 --> 00:00:39,179
I'm not worried about that.

15
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:43,179
You know what you're doing, but Olivia is a good girl.

16
00:00:43,179 --> 00:00:46,179
Why don't you try to get to know her, at least.

17
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:49,179
Maybe you will actually like her.

18
00:00:49,179 --> 00:00:52,179
But I have invited Olivia for dinner tonight,

19
00:00:52,179 --> 00:00:56,179
so you better be on your best behavior and make a good impression.

20
00:00:56,179 --> 00:00:59,179
Don't be the same jerk you've been for the past five years.

21
00:00:59,179 --> 00:01:03,740
That must be Olivia.

22
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:12,569
Good, dear. Come here.
