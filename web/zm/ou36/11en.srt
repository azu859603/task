1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,009
Oh, Olivia, dear, come in.

2
00:00:07,009 --> 00:00:09,009
There he goes again.

3
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:10,009
I can't believe it.

4
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:13,009
I am so sorry, Olivia.

5
00:00:13,009 --> 00:00:16,010
Will had a sudden work emergency.

6
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:18,010
Please forgive him.

7
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:20,010
How about you, stay for dinner.

8
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,010
I cooked a prime rib and chicken.

9
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,010
You know, it's okay, Miss Foster.

10
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:30,010
I actually have a lot of work to do, so let's just reschedule, okay?

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:43,859
I am a disaster.

12
00:00:43,859 --> 00:00:46,859
Oh, hello, sweetheart.

13
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:48,859
Bring your head to this place.

14
00:00:48,859 --> 00:00:49,859
My.

15
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:50,859
Let's have some fun.

16
00:00:50,859 --> 00:00:51,859
Stop.

17
00:00:51,859 --> 00:00:52,859
Don't shut up.

18
00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:53,859
Shut up.

19
00:00:53,859 --> 00:00:54,859
Stop.

20
00:00:54,859 --> 00:00:57,429
Wait, is that?

21
00:01:00,289 --> 00:01:01,320
Don't get up.

22
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,320
Give it up.

23
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,890
Oh!

24
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:05,890
Stop.

25
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:11,980
Get lost, you old Greta.

26
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:12,980
Mr. Hurt?

27
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:18,099
Olivia, what are you doing out here?

28
00:01:18,099 --> 00:01:19,099
What are you doing out here?

29
00:01:19,099 --> 00:01:20,099
Are you okay?

30
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:22,099
Yeah, I'm a...

31
00:01:22,099 --> 00:01:23,099
Yeah, I'm good.

32
00:01:23,099 --> 00:01:25,959
I can't let him know my own marriage is a mess.

33
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:27,959
I'm a divorce lawyer.

34
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:31,019
Yeah, I was just...

35
00:01:31,019 --> 00:01:32,019
I was meeting with client.

36
00:01:32,019 --> 00:01:36,109
I didn't expect to run into that mess.

37
00:01:36,109 --> 00:01:37,109
Client?

38
00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:40,870
You do, uh, post calls?

39
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:42,900
Yeah.

40
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,900
Occasionally, I just try to be flexible.

41
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,909
Let me drive you home.

42
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:50,909
It's not safe out here.

43
00:01:50,909 --> 00:02:03,569
Thank you.

44
00:02:03,569 --> 00:02:05,500
Mr. Hart...

45
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,500
or the ride...

46
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,500
and saving me.

47
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,490
Why do you do it?

48
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:12,060
I mean, the...

49
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,099
the job.

50
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:16,280
What's wrong with being a lawyer?

51
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,469
Well, it's challenging, but...

52
00:02:20,469 --> 00:02:23,340
my family really needs money.

53
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:28,259
My grandma, she just got out of the hospital recently, and...

54
00:02:28,259 --> 00:02:31,639
the bills are...

55
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:32,639
a lot.

56
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:35,250
She must be really tough...

57
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,409
struggling so much for her family.

58
00:02:37,409 --> 00:02:41,080
Anyway, um, thank you again.

59
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,909
Wait, I need you.

60
00:02:42,909 --> 00:02:52,280
My company's hiring for an executive assistant.

61
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,110
The pay and perks are pretty good,

62
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:57,110
and I think you'd be great.

63
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,110
Would you be interested?

64
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:01,360
You...

65
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,650
want me to be your assistant?

66
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:04,780
Yeah.

67
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:08,219
Then you won't have to deal with situations like...

68
00:03:08,219 --> 00:03:09,219
earlier at the war.

69
00:03:09,219 --> 00:03:14,419
I really appreciate the offer.

70
00:03:14,419 --> 00:03:17,419
Mr. Hart, but, um, I can handle my job.

71
00:03:17,419 --> 00:03:20,379
Seriously, that is so kind of you.

72
00:03:20,379 --> 00:03:26,939
Yeah, well, you change your mind just...

73
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:28,939
let me know later.

74
00:03:28,939 --> 00:03:31,419
I will, I promise.

75
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:33,060
Thanks again.

76
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,060
Hey.

77
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:46,110
He's not as cold and distant as I thought.

78
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:55,150
Ben drove you home.

79
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:57,150
I saw him at the front door.

80
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,569
What?

81
00:03:58,569 --> 00:04:03,699
In a fancy car.

82
00:04:03,699 --> 00:04:06,340
Dropped you off, didn't he?

83
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:07,340
Thought he was your husband.

84
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:11,800
Oh, he is.

85
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,800
So you got yourself a rich boyfriend now.

86
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,050
The field, huh?

87
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:18,819
What are you talking about?

88
00:04:18,819 --> 00:04:19,819
You know he married.

89
00:04:19,819 --> 00:04:21,879
He's just...

90
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:22,879
someone I know.

91
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:23,879
Oh, yeah.

92
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:26,879
He married five years and you've never seen your husband.

93
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:28,879
What kind of a marriage is that?

94
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:37,339
Where are you going?

95
00:04:37,339 --> 00:04:39,459
Is that job interview you talked about?

96
00:04:39,459 --> 00:04:49,870
You know.

97
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,870
You're so stuck and you're boring little job.

98
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:54,870
I'm heading to a nightclub downtown.

99
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:58,870
Once I snag a rich guy, I'll never have to work like you.

100
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:01,870
Maybe someone in finance, trust fund,

101
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,870
six, five, and blue eyes.

102
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:18,360
You don't get it, do you?

103
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,399
What?

104
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:28,529
What kind of client coming sure you're prepared?

105
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:29,529
Yes.

106
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:30,529
Yeah, absolutely, Mr. Wilson.

107
00:05:30,529 --> 00:05:38,730
I will be ready.

108
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:40,730
Well, the client's already in the conference room.

109
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:42,730
Mr. Wilson's in there with him.

110
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:44,730
He is a total potty.

111
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:47,079
Looks a little picky though.

112
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:48,079
Good luck.

113
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:58,379
Mr. Hart, I have the best way of shrieking town.

114
00:05:58,379 --> 00:06:01,050
All I show your wife doesn't get a penny.

115
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:03,050
Well, he's actually not my concern.

116
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:05,050
Next, Mr. Hart.

117
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:06,050
I'm Dominic Vanderbilt.

118
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:08,050
I'm sure you've heard of my family.

119
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:11,170
Trust me, I can help you.

120
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,170
First off, no, I've never heard of your family.

121
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:16,170
And second, how exactly would that help me in my divorce?

122
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:21,029
I know how greedy a woman can be in that fact.

123
00:06:21,029 --> 00:06:26,139
I want a solution, not a battle.

124
00:06:26,139 --> 00:06:30,100
This is the best you can offer.

125
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:33,470
Seems like your firm isn't interested in representing.

126
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:35,470
Wait, Mr. Hart, please.

127
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:44,629
Mr. Hart.

128
00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:46,430
Mr. Hart.

129
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:48,430
You know each other?

130
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:49,819
No.

131
00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:51,819
Mr. Hart, this is Olivia.

132
00:06:51,819 --> 00:06:53,819
She's one of our top divorce lawyers.

133
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:54,819
You're a lawyer.

134
00:06:54,819 --> 00:06:58,829
Is that news to you?

135
00:06:58,829 --> 00:06:59,829
I introduced her to you.

136
00:06:59,829 --> 00:07:00,829
Don't you remember?

137
00:07:00,829 --> 00:07:05,329
And you rejected her.

138
00:07:05,329 --> 00:07:06,329
Sorry.

139
00:07:06,329 --> 00:07:08,649
Mr. Hart arrived early, so we started to appreciate it.

140
00:07:08,649 --> 00:07:09,649
It's fine.

141
00:07:09,649 --> 00:07:12,000
He won't choose me anyway.

142
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I already tried.

143
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,579
Anyway, Mr. Hart, it is a pleasure to see you again.

144
00:07:16,579 --> 00:07:18,579
And, uh, good luck with your divorce.

145
00:07:18,579 --> 00:07:19,579
Wait.

146
00:07:19,579 --> 00:07:23,250
I want you to be my divorce lawyer.

147
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:29,220
I want you to be my divorce lawyer.

148
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,730
Me?

149
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:35,550
I thought you didn't want me.

150
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:36,550
Excuse me.

151
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:37,550
What's going on?

152
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:40,550
You turned her down when I first recommended her.

153
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:42,550
That's why we're here.

154
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:44,550
Now you've changed your mind again?

155
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:48,310
It was a mistake.

156
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,790
So?

157
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:50,790
Will you represent me?

158
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:51,819
Of course.

159
00:07:51,819 --> 00:07:52,819
Of course she will.

160
00:07:52,819 --> 00:07:54,240
It's our pleasure.

161
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,240
Right, Olivia?

162
00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:01,689
Let's start with the basics.

163
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:04,689
How long have you been married and do you have any children?

164
00:08:04,689 --> 00:08:07,750
God, I can't believe I mistook her for an escort.

165
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:11,420
She's nothing like that.

166
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,420
Mr. Hart?

167
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:15,579
Oh, uh, five years.

168
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:16,579
No children.

169
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:21,810
Why do you want to get a divorce?

170
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:24,810
Will you have married because she saved my life?

171
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:27,290
There's no real connection between us.

172
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:30,699
Wow, that's, uh, quite a story.

173
00:08:30,699 --> 00:08:32,700
How did she save your life?

174
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:38,090
Uh, it's a long story.

175
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:40,090
Maybe for another time.

176
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:42,090
But anyway, I figured I owed her as much.

177
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:45,090
So, if I can afford it, she can take whatever she wants.

178
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:47,500
Wow.

179
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,500
He's willing to give her anything she wants.

180
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,500
How nice.

181
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,179
If only my jerk husband was half as considerate.

182
00:08:56,179 --> 00:08:59,179
Olivia, I'm not trying to hide anything from you.

183
00:08:59,179 --> 00:09:02,879
It's too complicated.

184
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:05,360
Uh, no, no, no, sorry.

185
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,360
I was just thinking.

186
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,360
Um, okay.

187
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,360
I think I have a great grasp at the situation.

188
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,360
Now it's the important part.

189
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,320
Telling your wife about the divorce.

190
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:19,960
Would you like me to handle that or do you want to talk to her yourself?

191
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,960
I'll call her.

192
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,960
Hello?

193
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:45,690
Mrs. Foster?

194
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:50,129
I've heard William's been talking to lawyers.

195
00:09:50,129 --> 00:09:52,129
That's nonsense.

196
00:09:52,129 --> 00:09:55,129
If he tries to use a lawyer to intimidate you.

197
00:09:55,129 --> 00:09:57,129
Let me know.

198
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:58,190
I'll take care of it.

199
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:01,190
Thank you, Mrs. Foster, but I'm a lawyer, too.

200
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:04,190
He can intimidate me, but I appreciate it.

201
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:05,190
Thanks.

202
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:14,259
Is this Olivia?

203
00:10:14,259 --> 00:10:17,950
This is your husband.

204
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,110
What?

205
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:25,340
So this is Olivia's mysterious husband.

206
00:10:27,269 --> 00:10:28,269
I'm not...

207
00:10:28,269 --> 00:10:29,269
What a divorce.

208
00:10:29,269 --> 00:10:31,269
It's time we discuss a settlement.

209
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:32,269
Settlement?

210
00:10:32,269 --> 00:10:33,269
What are you offering?

211
00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:36,590
Cash, stocks, or bonds, whatever you prefer.

212
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:41,580
If that's not what you want, you can't be villain Miami or the estate Beverly Hills.

213
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:44,740
Olivia's husband is eluded.

214
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:47,740
I can't let this opportunity go to waste.

215
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:52,019
I need to think about it.

216
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:53,019
Okay.

217
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:55,019
Let's meet on Friday to finalize everything.

218
00:10:55,019 --> 00:11:00,919
It's your fault you left your phone at home.

219
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:03,919
Now the jackpot is all mine.

220
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:06,909
Make this count.

221
00:11:06,909 --> 00:11:14,279
What was that?

222
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:18,750
Oh, uh, it was just some personal stuff.

223
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:19,750
I just talked to my wife.

224
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,750
We've been on Friday to finalize everything.

225
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,169
Can you come with me?

226
00:11:23,169 --> 00:11:24,169
Of course.

227
00:11:24,169 --> 00:11:26,200
That's what you pay for.

228
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:32,610
Uh, what kind of woman is lucky enough to marry a man like him?

229
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:38,980
No.

230
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:44,129
Oh, I got a really big client today.

231
00:11:44,129 --> 00:11:45,129
Oh, really?

232
00:11:45,129 --> 00:11:46,129
Mm-hmm.

233
00:11:46,129 --> 00:11:48,730
Congrats.

234
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:54,360
Anyway, when was the last time you saw your husband?

235
00:11:54,360 --> 00:12:00,149
Uh, like five years ago, but we only met once.

236
00:12:00,149 --> 00:12:01,149
Why?

237
00:12:01,149 --> 00:12:02,149
I'm just curious.

238
00:12:02,149 --> 00:12:05,629
Do you think he'd even recognize you now?

239
00:12:05,629 --> 00:12:09,490
Probably not.

240
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:13,490
He wasn't really in the best shape back then, so I would say no.

241
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:16,490
Oh, that sucks.

242
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:19,539
Hey, have you seen my other phone?

243
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:23,960
I, uh, think I left it at home today and I haven't been able to find it.

244
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:28,830
There it is.

245
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:29,830
Oh, no!

246
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:34,539
This is mine.

247
00:12:34,539 --> 00:12:36,019
Sorry.

248
00:12:36,019 --> 00:12:39,120
It just looks really similar.

249
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,759
Have you seen mine?

250
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:42,759
No.

251
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:45,720
It brought us somewhere else.

252
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:59,379
So, about this meeting with your wife.

253
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:01,379
Do you have any thoughts on how you'd like it to go?

254
00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:04,529
I want it to be over quickly.

255
00:13:04,529 --> 00:13:05,529
No drama.

256
00:13:05,529 --> 00:13:06,529
No fights.

257
00:13:06,529 --> 00:13:07,529
Okay, sure.

258
00:13:07,529 --> 00:13:09,529
I will try and make sure it goes really smooth.

259
00:13:09,529 --> 00:13:25,960
Buddy, he's such a hottie.

260
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:37,659
Wait, isn't that Olivia?

261
00:13:37,659 --> 00:13:40,039
What's she doing here?

262
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:53,139
How is Olivia here?

263
00:13:53,139 --> 00:14:09,240
Does she know about the meeting with her husband?

264
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:13,100
He doesn't know Olivia is his wife?

265
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,100
Are you alone?

266
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,100
With my lawyer.

267
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,419
She's trying to make sure everything goes smoothly.

268
00:14:17,419 --> 00:14:18,419
Is there a problem?

269
00:14:18,419 --> 00:14:22,419
So he's the big client Olivia mentioned.

270
00:14:22,419 --> 00:14:27,419
She's both his wife and his lawyer and she has no clue.

271
00:14:27,419 --> 00:14:31,000
If you want to talk, tell your lawyer to leave.

272
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Otherwise, there's no deal.

273
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:42,620
My wife wants to talk alone.

274
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:45,909
I'm sorry about your whole life step out for a bit.

275
00:14:45,909 --> 00:14:47,039
It's okay.

276
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:49,039
A lot of people get nervous about lawyers.

277
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:51,899
I'll just wait outside.

278
00:14:51,899 --> 00:15:07,440
Long time no see.

279
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,440
It's cut to the chase.

280
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,440
We only got married because you saved my life.

281
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,440
There's no actual connection between us.

282
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,269
This marriage is a burden to us both.

283
00:15:16,269 --> 00:15:18,269
Olivia saved his life.

284
00:15:18,269 --> 00:15:20,269
She's never mentioned that.

285
00:15:20,269 --> 00:15:21,269
It's good a divorce.

286
00:15:21,269 --> 00:15:24,500
Name returns and I'll compensate you fairly.

287
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,529
He's loaded and hot.

288
00:15:26,529 --> 00:15:29,529
Cashing in seems like such a waste.

289
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:31,529
I need some time to think about it.

290
00:15:31,529 --> 00:15:33,169
Don't try this out.

291
00:15:33,169 --> 00:15:35,259
I'm not going to wait forever.

292
00:15:35,259 --> 00:15:36,389
You have one week.

293
00:15:36,389 --> 00:15:38,389
After that, the offer's off the table.

294
00:15:38,389 --> 00:15:50,539
Uh, did your wife agree to the divorce?

295
00:15:50,539 --> 00:15:52,820
She won't say what she wants.

296
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:55,820
She'll probably go big or she cares about his money.

297
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:58,299
I feel like she's so different now.

298
00:15:58,299 --> 00:15:59,299
Different now?

299
00:15:59,299 --> 00:16:02,039
Well, it's hard to say.

300
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:04,649
When she saved my life, she expected nothing.

301
00:16:04,649 --> 00:16:08,159
And now she's a total gold digger.

302
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:15,889
We found the one behind the attack five years ago.

303
00:16:15,889 --> 00:16:17,889
It's Sebastian Crowley.

304
00:16:17,889 --> 00:16:18,889
His company company.

305
00:16:18,889 --> 00:16:22,529
And he wants to take us down by going after you.

306
00:16:22,529 --> 00:16:25,580
He thought he could come after me and get away with it.

307
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:28,000
He'll pay for this.

308
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I want his company gone in a week.

309
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,539
He'll have nothing after messing with me.

310
00:16:33,539 --> 00:16:35,539
Wow, that's pretty cool.

311
00:16:35,539 --> 00:16:38,019
You're afraid of me.

312
00:16:38,019 --> 00:16:44,129
Actually, I admire your sense of justice.

313
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,480
Sit for 10.

314
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,480
It's not supposed to be.

315
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:51,019
You know, they come to crawl?

316
00:16:51,019 --> 00:16:55,019
Sometimes when you're kind to your enemies, you're being cruel to yourself.

317
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:58,139
That's why I choose to be strong.

318
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:01,679
She has the same name as my wife, but they're so different.

319
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:40,900
Tomorrow is your birth for dinner.

320
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:43,859
It'll be there too.

321
00:17:43,859 --> 00:17:47,019
You two can celebrate together.

322
00:17:47,019 --> 00:17:50,849
It's time to have a proper talk with that jerk.

323
00:17:50,849 --> 00:17:52,849
Yeah, I'll be there.

324
00:17:52,849 --> 00:17:55,849
Oh, and I have a little surprise for you.

325
00:17:55,849 --> 00:17:57,849
I'll find out tomorrow.

326
00:17:57,849 --> 00:18:00,829
Thanks.

327
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:01,829
Hello, day tomorrow.

328
00:18:01,829 --> 00:18:06,660
No, it's just a small family dinner.

329
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,660
It's my birthday.

330
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,299
Wait.

331
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:23,049
Her birthday is tomorrow?

332
00:18:23,049 --> 00:18:26,039
Lydia, you did all of this?

333
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:30,509
You actually remembered it was my birthday.

334
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:32,509
Oh, of course.

335
00:18:32,509 --> 00:18:35,509
I wanted to do something special for you.

336
00:18:35,509 --> 00:18:37,509
Happy birthday.

337
00:18:37,509 --> 00:18:38,670
Thank you.

338
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:43,680
This is so good.

339
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:50,220
So I heard you got married because you saved your husband's life.

340
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,670
Mm.

341
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:52,670
Bit.

342
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:54,539
That.

343
00:18:54,539 --> 00:18:57,539
Well, he got into some trouble these guys were after him.

344
00:18:57,539 --> 00:19:00,539
And I helped him hide from them.

345
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:09,200
Actually, I stole a scar from that night.

346
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:22,690
From now on, both your husband and your scar belong to me.

347
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:27,579
These flowers are gorgeous.

348
00:19:27,579 --> 00:19:29,579
They must have cost a fortune.

349
00:19:29,579 --> 00:19:31,579
I heard Olivia's husband sent them.

350
00:19:31,579 --> 00:19:32,579
So romantic.

351
00:19:32,579 --> 00:19:33,900
Oh.

352
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,900
Can I help you, sir?

353
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:38,599
I'm here to see Olivia better.

354
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:45,269
Oh, are you her husband?

355
00:19:45,269 --> 00:19:46,589
What?

356
00:19:46,589 --> 00:19:47,589
She's married?

357
00:19:47,589 --> 00:19:48,589
Of course.

358
00:19:48,589 --> 00:19:50,589
Oh, I'm sorry.

359
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:53,980
Her husband's at this beautiful bouquet earlier and we thought you were him.

360
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:54,980
Oh, I'm in here.

361
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:55,980
She is now.

362
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,259
Hi.

363
00:19:57,259 --> 00:20:01,460
The delivery guy said that he delivered me something do you have to know where it is?

364
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,460
From your husband.

365
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:05,029
Isn't that sweet?

366
00:20:05,029 --> 00:20:08,029
Oh, this must be the surprise Mrs. Foster mentioned.

367
00:20:08,029 --> 00:20:10,029
She sent it in my husband's name.

368
00:20:10,029 --> 00:20:13,160
Oh, and this gentleman is here to see.

369
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:16,430
I'm so sorry.

370
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:17,430
I didn't see you.

371
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:20,529
Did you want to talk to me about something?

372
00:20:20,529 --> 00:20:25,910
So?

373
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:26,910
Yeah.

374
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:28,910
For the past five years now.

375
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:32,710
So the family dinner you mentioned yesterday.

376
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:35,029
That was with your husband.

377
00:20:35,029 --> 00:20:37,029
Yes, and his family.

378
00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:43,619
The flowers are forward.

379
00:20:46,059 --> 00:20:52,980
Oh, for a friend who just moved.

380
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:53,980
I should get going.

381
00:20:53,980 --> 00:21:01,410
Do you happen to know why Mr. Hart was here?

382
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:05,059
She's married.

383
00:21:05,059 --> 00:21:08,059
Who's the lucky guy that got to marry her?

384
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:12,359
Grandma?

385
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:22,779
Olivia, I know it's been tough for you these past few years.

386
00:21:22,779 --> 00:21:28,869
Will has been so caught up with his work, he's neglected you.

387
00:21:28,869 --> 00:21:32,869
But tonight, you two will finally talk it.

388
00:21:32,869 --> 00:21:35,700
He should be here any minute.

389
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,700
Thank you, Mrs. Foster.

390
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,700
I appreciate it.

391
00:21:38,700 --> 00:22:05,700
Mrs. Foster, I'm sorry.

392
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,700
The boss had a last minute emergency and won't be able to make it.

393
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,700
He sends his apologies.

394
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:17,579
Oh, dear.

395
00:22:17,579 --> 00:22:20,859
Olivia, don't worry.

396
00:22:20,859 --> 00:22:24,859
I'll get him here tonight, no matter what.

397
00:22:24,859 --> 00:22:26,859
This is unacceptable.

398
00:22:26,859 --> 00:22:28,859
It's really okay, Mrs. Foster.

399
00:22:28,859 --> 00:22:34,299
He's probably busy and we'll get another chance to be.

400
00:22:34,299 --> 00:22:36,299
Actually, you know what, I totally forgot.

401
00:22:36,299 --> 00:22:40,299
I've got this report due in the morning, so I should really get going.

402
00:22:40,299 --> 00:22:52,940
What an unforgettable birthday.

403
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:56,480
My husband doesn't want to see me.

404
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,859
I don't even know what he looks like.

405
00:22:59,859 --> 00:23:03,859
I'm a divorce lawyer who can't even handle her own marriage.

406
00:23:03,859 --> 00:23:08,410
Screw it.

407
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:09,410
I need a drink.

408
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:17,619
She's married?

409
00:23:17,619 --> 00:23:18,619
How's that even possible?

410
00:23:18,619 --> 00:23:23,910
She didn't even mention a husband.

411
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:26,910
She's probably celebrating her birthday with him right now.
