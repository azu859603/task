00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.400
All of you?

2
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.119
Mr. Hart.

3
00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:22.039
Aren't you with your husband?

4
00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:24.039
No, that jerk bailed on me.

5
00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:30.899
Some business came up or whatever, so I hope he's spending my birthday.

6
00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:33.469
He couldn't spare up one night.

7
00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:38.000
He doesn't want to see me.

8
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.020
He disappeared five years ago and nothing has changed.

9
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.020
Of course he forgot my birthday.

10
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.780
What an idiot.

11
00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.939
He doesn't appreciate how amazing you really are.

12
00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:52.939
And he'll regret that.

13
00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:54.350
It's okay.

14
00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:57.899
He's just spending my birthday alone anyway.

15
00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:10.209
Anyway, um, what about you?

16
00:01:10.209 --> 00:01:11.560
What are you doing here?

17
00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.359
I, uh, I miss a chance to say Happy Birthday to a friend.

18
00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:19.450
But I'm lucky she's here now.

19
00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.099
So maybe I still can.

20
00:01:24.099 --> 00:01:25.099
Wait, you mean?

21
00:01:25.099 --> 00:01:30.060
Happy Birthday to you.

22
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.909
Happy Birthday to you.

23
00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:44.730
Happy Birthday to you.

24
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:50.000
Happy Birthday to you.
