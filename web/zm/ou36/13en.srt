00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I don't think anyone has celebrated my birthday like that a really long time.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,669
Thank you, Mr. Hart.

3
00:00:07,669 --> 00:00:10,179
And I have something for you too.

4
00:00:10,179 --> 00:00:16,309
Oh my god.

5
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:20,920
He's so thoughtful, unlike my asshole husband.

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:29,890
Who?

7
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:30,890
Looks amazingly.

8
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:33,950
Oh god, this is crazy.

9
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:38,179
I think this is the best birthday present I've ever received.

10
00:00:38,179 --> 00:00:39,590
Thank you.

11
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:43,880
You deserve the best gift in the world, and a better husband too.

12
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:52,429
Did we?

13
00:00:52,429 --> 00:00:53,429
No!

14
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:57,429
He brought this cake out sometimes.

15
00:00:57,429 --> 00:01:02,899
Then I said, I'm the CEO.

16
00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:12,359
No!

17
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:13,359
I have to go.

18
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:24,129
Let me drive you.

19
00:01:24,129 --> 00:01:25,129
Yeah, go.
