1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:01,659
What?

2
00:00:01,659 --> 00:00:03,740
What was that?

3
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:08,060
Oh, that's just... just my cousin.

4
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:14,900
Anyways, sorry for being like really drunk last night.

5
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:16,899
Thank you for taking me home.

6
00:00:16,899 --> 00:00:17,929
My pleasure.

7
00:00:17,929 --> 00:00:28,609
Call me next time you need a drinking buddy.

8
00:00:28,609 --> 00:00:30,609
Can we talk about this, Mr. Hart's gone.

9
00:00:30,609 --> 00:00:40,640
I swear nothing happened.

10
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,759
Hello?

11
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:47,820
Our foundation is hope that this Wednesday at Magnet Palace.

12
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,820
We'll be sure to be there this time.

13
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,820
I promise.

14
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,820
We'd love for you to join us.

15
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:54,820
Wednesday?

16
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:58,820
Mrs. Foster, I'd love to go, but I'm not quite sure if I'm free.

17
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,820
How about I check my schedule and I'll go back to you?

18
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:04,420
Oh, of course, dear. Let me know.

19
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:06,700
Okay.

20
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,700
Magnet Palace.

21
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,700
That place costs a fortune.

22
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:11,700
Who are you talking to?

23
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,700
Oh, it was just my husband's family.

24
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,700
They're hosting like this charity event.

25
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:17,700
Wednesday?

26
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:18,700
Are you going?

27
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,700
Uh, yeah, I don't know.

28
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,700
Probably not. I've been really busy.

29
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:27,140
So, do you like when I talk about...

30
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:29,140
Oh, no. No, I'm fine.
