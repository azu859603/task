1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,990
Do you decide what you want?

2
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:18,420
I heard the Hark family is having an event Wednesday.

3
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:19,420
We can talk there.

4
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:24,149
How do you know about the event?

5
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:25,780
Your grandma invited me.

6
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:28,100
Okay, Wednesday it is.

7
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,739
Keep your word this time.

8
00:00:29,739 --> 00:00:32,299
And don't bring your lawyer.

9
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:33,299
That's my condition.

10
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:39,590
I'll be meeting my wife on Wednesday.

11
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:42,829
She still has issues with the lawyer, so I'll be going alone.

12
00:00:42,829 --> 00:00:43,829
Just wanted to let you know.

13
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:54,590
Okay, stay cool.

14
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:56,329
Come down Olivia.

15
00:00:56,329 --> 00:01:06,549
Okay, plans on Wednesday too.

16
00:01:06,549 --> 00:01:12,209
Just keep me updated.

17
00:01:12,209 --> 00:01:13,209
This is Foster.

18
00:01:13,209 --> 00:01:14,209
Hi.

19
00:01:14,209 --> 00:01:15,209
Yeah.

20
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:17,310
About the charity event you mentioned?

21
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,340
I can make it.

22
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:19,340
I'll see you Wednesday.

23
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:24,040
I'm going to confront that jerk.

24
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,420
Her marriage keeps going in the instruction and there's no reason to stay in it.
