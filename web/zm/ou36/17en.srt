1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,040
Do you have an invitation?

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:07,040
Oh. No, I was actually invited over the phone.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:13,160
Well, I'm afraid you can't come in. This is an exclusive event.

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,160
Well, why don't they need an invitation?

5
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,160
Oh. Because I say so.

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,160
They don't smell like some gold digger trying to crash the party.

7
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,160
Mrs. Foster actually invited me.

8
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,160
So please let her or Gary Hoffman or Butler know. They're expecting me.

9
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,160
Oh, did your homework and everything?

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,160
Looked up the family member's names?

11
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,159
Real ambitious, aren't you?

12
00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:37,539
You know what? This is ridiculous. Please let them know or let me in.

13
00:00:37,539 --> 00:00:43,539
I've seen plenty of women like you. I think wearing a fancy dress will get you an in with high society.

14
00:00:43,539 --> 00:00:45,539
Making up pathetic lies to mingle with the rich.

15
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:49,539
Newsflash chick, you don't belong here.

16
00:00:49,539 --> 00:00:52,539
Next time you want to get in, apply for a janitor job.

17
00:00:52,539 --> 00:00:54,539
You know what? This is bullshit.

18
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:56,670
Security, get her out of here.

19
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,670
Hey, no, I did not.
