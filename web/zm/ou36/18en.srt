1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Mr. Hart, this woman doesn't have an invitation, she's trying to sneak in, just another gold digger trying to crush the party.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,480
Is that so?

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,480
Mr. Hart, what a coincidence.

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:18,480
What a climber. Are you flirting with Mr. Hart? You're parking up the wrong tree.

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,480
Mr. Hart isn't someone you could just cozy up to.

6
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,480
If you don't want to be the next slapping stock, you'll better leave before he kicks you off with himself.

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:32,100
I think it's you, we should leave.

8
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,100
What?

9
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,100
She's my lawyer, and she's here with me.

10
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,100
Or do I need an invitation too?

11
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,100
No, no, of course not. I didn't know if she was with you.

12
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:45,649
Oh, and that's why you chose to insult her?

13
00:00:45,649 --> 00:00:50,649
You're fired. And for the record, no company or the Hart name will ever hire you again.

14
00:00:50,649 --> 00:00:52,649
No, no please!

15
00:00:52,649 --> 00:01:01,219
Oh, right, that's impressive.

16
00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:04,219
He's even hotter when he's all serious.

17
00:01:04,219 --> 00:01:15,620
I thought you had plans tonight.

18
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:17,620
Well, brings her hair.
