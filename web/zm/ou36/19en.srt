1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:04,019
Oh, I was, uh, was actually meeting someone.

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:07,360
It's my world.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,390
Were you here to meet your husband?

4
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:10,779
Um...

5
00:00:10,779 --> 00:00:11,779
That jerk!

6
00:00:11,779 --> 00:00:14,869
I can't believe he left you all by yourself to deal with that.

7
00:00:14,869 --> 00:00:16,870
Is Mr. Hart trying to defend me?

8
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:18,870
But this is the Foster's event.

9
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:20,870
I can't let him risk making a scene because of me.

10
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:22,870
Uh, no, it was, um...

11
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:24,899
I'm just here to meet a friend.

12
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:44,979
So sorry.

13
00:00:44,979 --> 00:00:46,979
I must have lost my balance.
