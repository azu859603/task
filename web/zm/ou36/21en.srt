1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,240
I'm going to go get myself another drink.

2
00:00:05,379 --> 00:00:06,540
Oh, Mr. Hoffman.

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:07,540
Olivia.

4
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:10,460
Um, Mrs. Foster said that Bill was here.

5
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:12,179
Do you happen to know where he is?

6
00:00:14,179 --> 00:00:16,379
Uh, I think he just stepped out.

7
00:00:17,379 --> 00:00:18,379
Left.

8
00:00:18,899 --> 00:00:19,899
Again.

9
00:00:20,629 --> 00:00:22,149
You could always wait.

10
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:24,589
I have waited five years for him.

11
00:00:24,589 --> 00:00:27,190
I'm not going to waste another second.

12
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:29,190
Ugh.

13
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:35,299
Why are they just talking?

14
00:00:35,299 --> 00:00:37,299
Did they have a fight?

15
00:00:37,299 --> 00:00:39,299
I need to tell Ms. Foster.

16
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:42,640
Name your price.

17
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,640
What do you want?

18
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,640
You brought your lawyer.

19
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,640
Why is Olivia Bennett here?

20
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,640
I said no lawyers.

21
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,640
She's not here as my lawyer.

22
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,640
It's just a coincidence.

23
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,640
How do you know her name?

24
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,409
Your wife?

25
00:00:55,409 --> 00:00:59,409
Of course I should know your divorce lawyer's name.

26
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:03,979
And the scar remembers too.

27
00:01:03,979 --> 00:01:06,980
After all these years, it's still here.

28
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:08,980
It will be forever.

29
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:16,870
You have no idea how bad it hurt when I was hit by those thugs.

30
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:18,870
Isn't that a bite mark I left on her shoulder?

31
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:21,129
What does that have to do with the thugs?

32
00:01:21,129 --> 00:01:24,219
Who are you, really?
