1
00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:11,669
Oh, I am so sorry, I thought you were someone else.

2
00:00:11,669 --> 00:00:13,669
She looks exactly like Lydia.

3
00:00:13,669 --> 00:00:31,000
Put this on!

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,939
Put your mouth shut.

5
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:42,939
Having fun pretending to be Hart's wife?

6
00:00:42,939 --> 00:00:47,859
I don't know what you're talking about.

7
00:00:47,859 --> 00:00:49,859
I know you're not really Mrs. Hart.

8
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:53,619
But don't worry, I can make it happen.

9
00:00:53,619 --> 00:00:58,469
As long as you give me something in return.

10
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:01,469
So I saw you talking with your wife.

11
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:04,920
She's a lovely girl, isn't she?

12
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,920
Are you sure she's my wife?

13
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:10,079
There's just, I don't know, something a lot.

14
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:13,909
Of course she's your wife, what's gotten into you?

15
00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:17,909
Alright, but I was talking to her and she seems like nothing more than I'm going with her.

16
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:19,909
Since she's nothing like that.

17
00:01:19,909 --> 00:01:22,909
She had no idea who you were when she saved you.

18
00:01:22,909 --> 00:01:26,420
She didn't have to hear my- Oh, she's back!
