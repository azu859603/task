00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.419
You're married, Olivia, damn, he is so hot.

2
00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:15.669
What?

3
00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:19.219
Okay, yeah, I'm coming home right now.

4
00:00:19.219 --> 00:00:20.769
I have to go home.

5
00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:25.589
Now.

6
00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:27.710
Hey, I came back as soon as I got to the pool.

7
00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.050
Where are you going?

8
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.409
None of your business.

9
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.130
None of my business.

10
00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.049
Lydia, I promised your mom that I would look after you, okay?

11
00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:41.009
Just tell me what's going on to you.

12
00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:43.109
You have like a boyfriend.

13
00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:45.429
I'm not trying to, like, meddle in your life or anything.

14
00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:48.130
Just tell me what his name is.

15
00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:50.320
You really want to know his name?

16
00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.539
It'll freak you out.

17
00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:57.789
What?

18
00:00:57.789 --> 00:00:59.429
Lydia, please don't leave.

19
00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:07.459
Hey, so how'd it go?

20
00:01:07.459 --> 00:01:09.540
You seem pretty frantic this morning.

21
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.260
Yeah, it's my cousin.

22
00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.140
She ran away from home and I have no idea where she is

23
00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.950
and I'm just worried that some guy is like

24
00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.670
playing her or something.

25
00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.239
Don't worry.

26
00:01:23.239 --> 00:01:27.920
Sorry, I gotta go, someone's at the door.

27
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:28.959
I was there.
