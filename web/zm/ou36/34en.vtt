00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:17.350
Olivia, it's time to face your feelings.

2
00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.280
This is the guy you like.

3
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:26.679
And it's time to stop wasting time on a husband who doesn't want to see you.

4
00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:37.100
Mrs. Foster?

5
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.079
So, yes, I want a divorce.

6
00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:44.210
Please send me his phone number.

7
00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:54.729
Maybe why does his phone number look so familiar?

8
00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:55.729
Wait, I know you.

9
00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:56.729
How did you get in here?

10
00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:57.859
No!

11
00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:10.629
Don't get over me!

12
00:01:10.629 --> 00:01:12.629
My wife in a range of meeting for noon today.

13
00:01:12.629 --> 00:01:14.700
This divorce can't wait any longer.

14
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.700
Sure.

15
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:22.409
Oh, and this was up to your door.

16
00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.750
Hello?

17
00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.750
Long time no sea heart.

18
00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:31.750
Guess who's with me.

19
00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.750
Come alone if you want to see your wife alive.

20
00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.069
Is it all I want to retract?

21
00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:39.069
You seriously expect me to believe that?

22
00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:41.069
You still haven't seen the photos have you.

23
00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:44.859
I'm sure you'd like to talk then.

24
00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:47.659
Probably please.

25
00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:49.659
The moment isn't saved.
