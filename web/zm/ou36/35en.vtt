00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:02.649
None of us can't be.

2
00:00:02.649 --> 00:00:04.620
She was at home this morning.

3
00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:23.370
And how could she be my wife?

4
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:25.570
Olivia has nothing to do with our issues.

5
00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.329
She's just my lawyer.

6
00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:31.039
Leave her alone.

7
00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:36.710
You're just as naive as you were five years ago.

8
00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.509
Olivia, Olivia, are you here?

9
00:00:38.509 --> 00:00:39.859
Emma, what are you doing here?

10
00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:41.340
Olivia called.

11
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.719
She said she wanted to divorce you.

12
00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:51.880
Where is she?

13
00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.439
Where is she?

14
00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:55.640
Is she my wife?

15
00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.399
Yes, of course she is.

16
00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:00.560
You two have met already.

17
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:13.469
You're glad to see it.

18
00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:14.790
What?

19
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.790
Do you want?
