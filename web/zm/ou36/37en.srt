00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,209
Mr. Harrods.

2
00:00:02,209 --> 00:00:04,209
Olivia, I'm taking this home.

3
00:00:04,209 --> 00:00:11,710
You still don't know, do you?

4
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:14,160
William Hart is your husband.

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,739
The mysterious man you haven't seen in five years.

6
00:00:17,739 --> 00:00:19,899
What?

7
00:00:19,899 --> 00:00:20,899
Olivia, I can explain.

8
00:00:20,899 --> 00:00:24,539
No, no, I'm... I met your wife. She's...

9
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:26,539
She's familiar.

10
00:00:26,539 --> 00:00:27,539
Isn't she?

11
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:33,390
Your cousin Lydia has been posing as you the entire time.

12
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:37,390
And you had no idea when everyone come and be.

13
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:40,380
Leave her alone.

14
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:47,020
To help?
