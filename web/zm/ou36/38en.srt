1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,030
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have recognized you, sorry.

2
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:08,029
William, no, please, please!

3
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:12,439
Miss Bennett! Police! Don't move!

4
00:00:12,439 --> 00:00:14,439
Are you okay? Go on ambulance!

5
00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:21,019
You'll pull through, dear.

6
00:00:21,019 --> 00:00:26,019
Miss Bennett, we check the surveillance. She's the one who helped Crowley break into your house.

7
00:00:26,019 --> 00:00:33,090
How could you? Why would you lie to me?

8
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,600
You want to know why?

9
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,600
Why do you always get everything?

10
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,140
Why are you always so lucky?

11
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:47,429
Why is your husband one of the richest men in the world and I have to date on nobody?

12
00:00:47,429 --> 00:00:52,969
You're insane. Why doesn't he want me?

13
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:56,060
I'm younger and prettier than you.

14
00:00:56,060 --> 00:01:06,909
You know what? I should have never let you stay with me, you traitor!

15
00:01:06,909 --> 00:01:09,650
You know what to do.

16
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:15,829
Do you hear his family?

17
00:01:15,829 --> 00:01:18,439
Oh, how is he?
