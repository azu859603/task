00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:02.720
What do you mean that I'm no longer an employee?

2
00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:06.780
Olivia, as you know, the firm has been going through some financial issues.

3
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:08.779
In order to stay afloat, we had to sell out.

4
00:00:08.779 --> 00:00:12.779
Now, new management just sent us the retention list in your name.

5
00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:14.779
It wasn't included.

6
00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:20.820
But...

7
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.820
Did you see the mysterious partner's office?

8
00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.820
It looks totally decked out.

9
00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.260
You have a mega-master cost of time.

10
00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:50.990
I like your new office.

11
00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.079
I picked it out for you.

12
00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:55.079
It has the best view.

13
00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.619
What's going on?

14
00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:04.159
I just bought this law firm.

15
00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:05.159
Here's the deed.

16
00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.569
Where are the balls now?

17
00:01:07.569 --> 00:01:15.549
Mr. Hart, I...

18
00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:18.060
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.700
I missed out on how amazing you are from the start.

20
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.939
I was so stupid and arrogant.

21
00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:33.659
I can't imagine my life without showing you.

22
00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.849
Could you give me another chance?

23
00:01:35.849 --> 00:01:38.489
Be my wife.
