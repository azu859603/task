00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:07.320
I'm Rhea, the richest woman in the world, the daughter of the Duke of Seventh and the only

2
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:33.270
heiress of the Targaryen family.

3
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.189
Three years ago, I ran away from home.

4
00:00:35.189 --> 00:00:38.189
The series saved my life in a car accident and we started dating.

5
00:00:38.189 --> 00:00:41.590
I didn't want to scare my way, so I lied about who I was and pretended to be a delivery

6
00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:43.549
girl.

7
00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:47.109
For three years, I've secretly supported a startup business.

8
00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:51.109
And this delivery job has definitely shown me some weirdos.

9
00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:53.109
It's lost.

10
00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:59.109
Today, Mr. Baratheon, the owner of Baratheon Group, he's coming to visit the property.

11
00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:02.109
You're going to make our elevators dirty, take the stairs.

12
00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:05.900
Arguing isn't my thing.

13
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:11.659
Luckily, I have others to fight my fights.

14
00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:14.849
Tyrion Baratheon, or I come to you.

15
00:01:14.849 --> 00:01:21.180
He's the richest man of the North and he manages the real estate business for my family.

16
00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.280
Mr. Baratheon is almost every billion of the North.

17
00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.280
He's basically running the world here.

18
00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.280
Mr. Baratheon.

19
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.590
Mr. Baratheon.

20
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.129
My lady, I'm sorry I'm late.

21
00:01:36.129 --> 00:01:37.129
She's a lady?

22
00:01:37.129 --> 00:01:40.129
How could this dinky delivery girl be a lady?

23
00:01:40.129 --> 00:01:41.129
Shut up!

24
00:01:41.129 --> 00:01:44.090
You don't deserve to know who she is.

25
00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.310
These men?

26
00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.310
No need to make a scene to make them deliver the packages.

27
00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.980
And, um, no elevators allowed.

28
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:53.980
Very well.

29
00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:58.209
Be grateful that this lady has shown you mercy brats.

30
00:01:58.209 --> 00:02:01.069
Thank you for your mercy, my lady.

31
00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:02.069
Thank you.

32
00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:04.510
Oh, my lady.

33
00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.219
Where are you going?

34
00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:07.219
Today's my date.

35
00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:10.219
The series is not getting married.

36
00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:14.419
It's been around me, pickle.

37
00:02:14.419 --> 00:02:15.419
Come with me.

38
00:02:15.419 --> 00:02:16.419
Come with me.

39
00:02:16.419 --> 00:02:17.419
Put him up.

40
00:02:17.419 --> 00:02:18.419
Bang, bang.

41
00:02:18.419 --> 00:02:19.800
Ahhh.

42
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.800
Yes.

43
00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.800
Miss Pickles.

44
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.210
Miss Pickles.

45
00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.210
Hold that thought.

46
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:32.300
Boss, you keep pretending to be homeless to scare up your future fiance.

47
00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.300
Mrs. Stark is threatening to disown you.

48
00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:35.300
Okay.

49
00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.300
I'm not even that into her.

50
00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.300
If it wasn't for the bidding conference, I would have never even shown my face.

51
00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.819
Tell mother, the only girl I'll marry is a girl on my destiny.

52
00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:48.819
Is it that right, Miss Pickles, a girl on my destiny?

53
00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:52.319
That's who I'll marry.

54
00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:53.319
It's her.

55
00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:57.759
It's the girl from three years ago.
