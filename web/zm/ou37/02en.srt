1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,139
It's her. It's the girl from three years ago.

2
00:00:04,139 --> 00:00:14,250
No Miss Piggles. No Miss Piggles.

3
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,250
Is that homeless band fighting that dog for food?

4
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:26,420
No Miss Piggles.

5
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:29,579
Hey! That was my beef stick.

6
00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:36,219
You like beef sticks too.

7
00:00:36,219 --> 00:00:40,579
Finish high school?

8
00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:42,990
Um, twenty-eight.

9
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:44,990
I know. I, uh, was hoes good.

10
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:49,500
Well, you're not high class, but you're young and fit.

11
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,500
You don't have to fight this poor dog for food.

12
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,500
Here, go down to the Bartherian group.

13
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,500
I just contacted two main resources, so I'll give you a job.

14
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:01,920
Thank you. But I don't need a job.

15
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:34,349
This, this is Marjorie.

16
00:01:34,349 --> 00:01:37,799
She is the daughter of Mr. Lannister.

17
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:39,799
We're getting married.

18
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:46,680
Mary, I, the series I thought that we were getting married today.
