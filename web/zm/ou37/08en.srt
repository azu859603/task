00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:04,500
Greetings, Mr. Stark.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:09,439
I want you to get my wife a gift, something rare and expensive.

3
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:14,230
What?

4
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:33,420
Mr. Stark got married?

5
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:40,299
Last night, um, eat my homeless mushroom,

6
00:00:40,299 --> 00:00:42,299
as home style as it gets.

7
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:55,850
My husband?

8
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:58,850
I've got some business to take care of, but put this ring on.

9
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:12,920
I'll make sure I'm a dazzling husband.

10
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:22,219
It looks expensive, but it's too big for me.

11
00:01:22,219 --> 00:01:23,219
Shoot.

12
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:25,219
I've got it in my family's bid conference.

13
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:37,530
Your invitation, please?

14
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,230
The organizer.

15
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:42,230
You're asking me for an invitation?

16
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:44,230
You. Organizer?

17
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:50,230
If you're the organizer, then I'm the owner of this hotel.
