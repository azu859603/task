00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
Hey, no!

2
00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Not on my watch.

3
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.379
Who are you?

4
00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.699
Your husband.

5
00:00:09.699 --> 00:00:12.699
That's some cheesy pick-up line.

6
00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:13.789
Mushrooms.

7
00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:15.789
Like any bells.

8
00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:26.789
So it really is you.

9
00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:27.789
Wow.

10
00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:33.579
You look different.

11
00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:34.579
Where's your ring?

12
00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:35.579
Oh.

13
00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.060
Sorry.

14
00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.060
It's too big for me.

15
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.060
Oh, look who is this?

16
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.060
Her hobo husband.

17
00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.060
Did you think washing your face was going to stop the homeless smell?

18
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.060
So do you think that you could become part of the upper echelon?

19
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.060
What?

20
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.060
By renting a decent suit and just getting some luxury car?

21
00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:56.060
You know.

22
00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.060
You're really nothing more than a hobo.

23
00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.060
Security.

24
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.060
Take these people out.

25
00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.060
They're sneaking up this place.

26
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:06.140
Oh.

27
00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.140
Oh, it does stink in here.

28
00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.099
Do you think I'm a child?

29
00:01:12.099 --> 00:01:15.099
Try to bribe me with candy?

30
00:01:15.099 --> 00:01:16.099
Oh.

31
00:01:16.099 --> 00:01:17.099
No.

32
00:01:17.099 --> 00:01:18.099
Those are breath mints.

33
00:01:18.099 --> 00:01:20.099
Since you want to talk so much shit.

34
00:01:20.099 --> 00:01:29.760
I have a mix of her arrogance.

35
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.760
How dare you hurt Miss Marjorie.

36
00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.760
What are you doing?

37
00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.760
Guards.

38
00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:35.760
We have VIP.

39
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:45.500
Oh, Jyst, Miss Marjorie.

40
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:56.620
This is...

41
00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.680
Star Spoke.
