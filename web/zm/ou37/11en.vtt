00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.690
Before you talking to these hobo's?

2
00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:04.589
Shut up, do you know what this is?

3
00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.030
Yeah, it's a ring, and it's ugly.

4
00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:09.669
This is Starks' bummer's token.

5
00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:12.630
The Starks never showed their faces in public.

6
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.869
This token represents her.

7
00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:16.370
What are you kidding me?

8
00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:18.870
She's nothing more than a delivery girl.

9
00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:21.170
It's hard to get that.

10
00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.440
I gave it to her.

11
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.440
Mr. Stark.

12
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.940
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.480
Please forgive me.

14
00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.010
It's okay.

15
00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.969
However, you on the other hand,

16
00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.649
I'll make sure you're punished for your snobbery.

17
00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:37.649
Damn it.

18
00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:38.649
Oh, you tramps?

19
00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:40.490
I'm sure you picked up a fake.

20
00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.549
This potter has to be with the Starks,

21
00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:45.789
based on what these four generations.

22
00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:48.289
You can't find anywhere else.

23
00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:56.270
He's the way to ring.

24
00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:57.829
Be careful.

25
00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:00.780
Don't lose it.

26
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:01.619
No way.

27
00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:02.979
I'm sure it's a fake.

28
00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:05.180
I'm not crying for us, I'm Mr. Stark.

29
00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.920
I'm the owner of Robert Hotel.

30
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.959
Get out of here, get out.

31
00:01:09.959 --> 00:01:16.780
Let's go.

32
00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:30.010
What if he asked me about last night?

33
00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.010
Should I give him money as compensation?

34
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.010
What did normal people do in this situation?

35
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.620
You're blushing.

36
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:38.719
Are you shy?

37
00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:40.719
No, no, don't do things like that.

38
00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:43.579
So, about last night?

39
00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:45.579
I take full responsibility for what happened.

40
00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:47.579
I can pay you back for the rental car,

41
00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.579
the suit, the replica ring, um, here.

42
00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.579
Would, um, would two grand be enough?

43
00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.370
I don't want your money.

44
00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:03.120
What do you want to, um, uh, fame, status?

45
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.120
I can give you all that.

46
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.120
I don't want any of that.

47
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:14.080
I want you to be my wife.

48
00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:36.560
That Mr. Baratheon specifically told everyone to take care of

49
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.879
and promote Visarius.

50
00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:46.520
Seeing him today, it is very clear that he is top tier talent.

51
00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.520
Indeed, Mr. Baratheon is one of the top figures in the whole empire,

52
00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.520
only really the Southern Stark family comes close.

53
00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.520
With Mr. Baratheon's support,

54
00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.520
it will be long if all the Serus becomes a leading figure

55
00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.520
amongst the younger generation.

56
00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.520
Mr. Starco.

57
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.550
Oh, Mr. Serus, when you meet Mr. Baratheon, please.

58
00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:06.610
Put in a good word for me.

59
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:07.610
How can I not?

60
00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.610
You make two good of a team.

61
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.610
Having you marry my daughter is truly a blessing to the last of her family.

62
00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:13.610
Thank you.

63
00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:14.610
Thank you.

64
00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:15.610
You're all so kind.

65
00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:16.610
To the banquet!

66
00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:17.610
Yes!

67
00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:18.610
To the banquet!

68
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.610
Mr. Baratheon's and her money!

69
00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:22.610
I'm not sure.

70
00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:23.870
I'm not sure.

71
00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:24.870
Oh!

72
00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:25.870
I am.

73
00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.870
I can't believe you actually managed to sneak in here with this hope.

74
00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.280
Leave us alone.

75
00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.379
Trying to make me jealous.

76
00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:34.990
Alright.

77
00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:36.990
Alright, I guess I can write you a check.

78
00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:39.430
How's a million?

79
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.419
The enough, right?

80
00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:43.419
Now stop pestering me.

81
00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:45.580
Just a million.

82
00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.620
Don't embarrass yourself.

83
00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:56.330
There you rip up my check.

84
00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.360
Well, that was the nice way.

85
00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.879
Because it was either the check or your filthy mouth.

86
00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:02.879
Oh.

87
00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:04.879
I'm serious.

88
00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:05.879
What's wrong?

89
00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:10.569
Gentlemen, I apologize.

90
00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:12.569
This stalker is my ex.

91
00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:15.569
And she's incredibly unhappy because I dumped her.

92
00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:19.569
So she's trying to provoke me by marrying this hobo.

93
00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:20.569
I'll have this taken care of.

94
00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:22.569
She'll be remembered immediately.

95
00:04:22.569 --> 00:04:23.569
I'm sorry.

96
00:04:23.569 --> 00:04:27.569
But if you kick me out, I'm afraid we'd have to cancel the whole event.

97
00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:29.569
Hmm.

98
00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:30.569
I've heard of you.

99
00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:32.569
You're the simple delivery girl, right?

100
00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:34.569
Coming here and talking.

101
00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:35.569
Shit.

102
00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:38.569
Do you know that Mr. Baratheon is the one that organized this event?

103
00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:42.240
Dad, I didn't know that as I asked him to.

104
00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.899
Talk to him now.

105
00:04:45.899 --> 00:04:48.189
I swear, I'll rip that mouth straight off.

106
00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:55.310
I'd love to see you try.

107
00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:00.639
I would love to see you try.

108
00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:20.069
You should choose another seat.

109
00:05:20.069 --> 00:05:21.069
Look at them.

110
00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:22.069
They're all freaking out.

111
00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:24.000
I'm the seat.

112
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.670
That is the Baratheon seat.

113
00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:31.829
Dad is for the organizer and the event holder.

114
00:05:31.829 --> 00:05:33.829
How dare you?

115
00:05:33.829 --> 00:05:35.209
I know what.

116
00:05:35.209 --> 00:05:37.850
This chair's just...

117
00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:40.230
Thanks, honey.

118
00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:44.490
You should get a bigger one.

119
00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:46.779
Listen up, everyone.

120
00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:49.779
If she pisses off Mr. Baratheon, we are the ones to blame.

121
00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:52.779
And our businesses will take the heat.

122
00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:54.779
We need to make sure that she leaves right now.

123
00:05:54.779 --> 00:05:55.970
I agree.

124
00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:58.970
Our family status relies on Mr. Baratheon.

125
00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:03.040
If you disrespect him, you are our enemy.

126
00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:08.120
You have three seconds to get off that cheat.

127
00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:12.120
If not, I will make sure that your name is plastered

128
00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:15.120
all over the headlines and the billboards.

129
00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.120
Hmm.

130
00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.120
Let's see.

131
00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:21.120
What about we call you a racist?

132
00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.120
Oh.

133
00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.120
Yeah.

134
00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:27.120
Your life will be ruined.

135
00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.759
Oh, listen up, everyone.

136
00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:32.759
She is truly a marvel of meeting manipulation.

137
00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:35.800
I hope you like concrete coffin, sweetheart.

138
00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.310
That's my gang's specialty.

139
00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:39.439
Morning.

140
00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:42.879
Can anyone else here please come up with a more...

141
00:06:42.879 --> 00:06:45.300
a more creative threat?

142
00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:46.399
Dying?

143
00:06:46.399 --> 00:06:48.399
It's too easy for her.

144
00:06:48.399 --> 00:06:50.399
I'll arrest her.

145
00:06:50.399 --> 00:06:53.399
A dirty wench like her deserves to be thrown into a women's prison

146
00:06:53.399 --> 00:06:55.399
on an isolated island.

147
00:06:55.399 --> 00:07:00.329
Try virus 5.

148
00:07:00.329 --> 00:07:04.329
We just developed one touch and your skin will dissociate.

149
00:07:04.329 --> 00:07:07.100
Oh, scary!

150
00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:09.100
I bet the FDA is what they're gonna love, Mom.

151
00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:12.279
Try this.

152
00:07:12.279 --> 00:07:17.399
Let's see how that smart-ass-mount runs with one shot of this.

153
00:07:17.399 --> 00:07:19.399
No one puts their hands on it.

154
00:07:19.399 --> 00:07:21.399
Not on my watch.

155
00:07:21.399 --> 00:07:23.399
What dare you touch me, Mom?

156
00:07:23.399 --> 00:07:25.819
I'll make your life a living hell.

157
00:07:25.819 --> 00:07:27.819
Dear father-in-law, let me do it.

158
00:07:27.819 --> 00:07:28.819
Oh, yeah.

159
00:07:28.819 --> 00:07:29.819
I'll ruin that bitch's face.

160
00:07:29.819 --> 00:07:30.819
No one will ever want to see her, Mom.

161
00:07:30.819 --> 00:07:32.819
Mr. Tyrion Brabdi is here.

162
00:07:32.819 --> 00:07:37.040
Mr. Tyrion Brabdi is here.

163
00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:42.319
Everybody join the festivities.

164
00:07:42.319 --> 00:07:44.319
Ended up beautiful day.

165
00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:48.920
Very good.

166
00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:52.589
So good to see everyone.

167
00:07:52.589 --> 00:08:01.759
It just-just can't be.

168
00:08:01.759 --> 00:08:03.759
She must be important.

169
00:08:03.759 --> 00:08:04.759
He just bowed to her.

170
00:08:04.759 --> 00:08:05.759
No way.

171
00:08:05.759 --> 00:08:08.300
If she could boss Mr. Baratheon around.

172
00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:10.300
Why'd he go easy on her ex?

173
00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:11.300
He would've sent him a pop.

174
00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:14.300
But Mr. Baratheon did just take a knee to her.

175
00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:18.519
Brion doesn't know Mr. Baratheon, does she?

176
00:08:18.519 --> 00:08:22.839
I heard Tyrion only bows the Targaryen.

177
00:08:22.839 --> 00:08:24.870
So, she's telling the truth.

178
00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:25.870
She's Lady Targaryen.

179
00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:26.870
For real?

180
00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:28.930
Bring on the show, boys.

181
00:08:28.930 --> 00:09:01.679
Join the show, Mom.

182
00:09:01.679 --> 00:09:05.529
I do enjoy looking at muscular men.

183
00:09:05.529 --> 00:09:08.080
Paris seems to watch this in front of my new husband.

184
00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:11.080
What if he thinks I'm really that horny?

185
00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:14.110
Oh, what is this Tyrion up to?

186
00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:18.110
They would think I can't satisfy my wife, and she has to go for strippers.

187
00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:21.110
Now I understand why the serious gets special treatments.

188
00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:24.110
It turns out Tyrion goes both ways.

189
00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:29.139
If Jamie knew these male strippers were from me, it ruined my reputation as an elegant

190
00:09:29.139 --> 00:09:30.139
lady.

191
00:09:30.139 --> 00:09:34.059
That bitch is leaving!

192
00:09:34.059 --> 00:09:46.279
Rumor has it that Mr. Baratheon is under the Targaryens.

193
00:09:46.279 --> 00:09:49.279
Is she really one of the Targaryens?

194
00:09:49.279 --> 00:09:51.279
T, please just hide my identity.

195
00:09:51.279 --> 00:09:54.279
I don't want Jamie to get weird ideas about me.

196
00:09:54.279 --> 00:09:58.279
Mr. Baratheon, I'm so sorry that I took your seat.

197
00:09:58.279 --> 00:10:00.279
It was very rude of me.

198
00:10:00.279 --> 00:10:03.440
Oh, my lady wants her identity veiled.

199
00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:05.919
I should act along.

200
00:10:05.919 --> 00:10:07.970
See?

201
00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:11.320
Mr. Baratheon was calling her rude, not defending her.

202
00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:14.580
Yes, but Mr. Baratheon just kneeled before her.

203
00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:24.440
I was taking a knee to the Targaryen crest on the chair.

204
00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:27.440
They rule over the entire empire's wealth.

205
00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:31.240
Lie on them for all sorts of business.

206
00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:33.820
That is why I take a knee.

207
00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:39.000
I see the Targaryen crest.

208
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.090
That convinces him, surprisingly.

209
00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:45.320
Mr. Baratheon, she sat in the chair.

210
00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:49.320
He doesn't that tarnish the sacredness behind the Targaryen crest?

211
00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:51.539
It's a very good point.

212
00:10:51.539 --> 00:10:59.919
But has anyone died in a beautiful lady as set in the chair?

213
00:10:59.919 --> 00:11:06.279
The Targaryen family is very reclusive.

214
00:11:06.279 --> 00:11:10.710
We don't tolerate bullies.

215
00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:18.529
Which one of you just harmed her just now?

216
00:11:18.529 --> 00:11:31.190
Start talking!

217
00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:32.190
It wasn't me.

218
00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:34.190
I don't even have the virus on me.

219
00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:39.480
Please, Baratheon.

220
00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:41.740
Please, I'm sorry.

221
00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:42.740
Please don't hurt me.

222
00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:48.940
My lady, how do you wish to punish him?

223
00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:57.029
Well, you know, I don't really know all that much about punishment,

224
00:11:57.029 --> 00:12:02.559
but these guys really do seem to be extra well then.

225
00:12:02.559 --> 00:12:05.039
Enlighten me, gentlemen.

226
00:12:05.039 --> 00:12:06.039
What should we do with him?

227
00:12:06.039 --> 00:12:12.840
They go on.

228
00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:15.539
Please tell him what you just told me.

229
00:12:15.539 --> 00:12:24.299
I would blacklist him and his entire family from our hospital.

230
00:12:24.299 --> 00:12:31.299
I would deny them any treatment and a simple viral flu would kill him easily.

231
00:12:31.299 --> 00:12:35.299
I'll make him human punch back in our gang.

232
00:12:35.299 --> 00:12:39.299
One punch from everyone until he's pulp and we're a big gang.

233
00:12:39.299 --> 00:12:40.649
Easy.

234
00:12:40.649 --> 00:12:43.649
We'll cook up his scandals.

235
00:12:43.649 --> 00:12:46.750
He'll be a laughing stop for generations.

236
00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:51.519
For the rest of his life.

237
00:12:51.519 --> 00:12:53.899
He'd be in prison.

238
00:12:53.899 --> 00:12:57.899
I'll have police arrest him and they'll throw him in with the worst of criminals.

239
00:12:57.899 --> 00:13:01.899
And I bet he'd be their favorite pudding.

240
00:13:02.899 --> 00:13:04.899
Please.

241
00:13:04.899 --> 00:13:09.529
Really nice Christmas kids.

242
00:13:09.529 --> 00:13:13.250
Please.

243
00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:14.250
Please.

244
00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:15.250
Spare me.

245
00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:16.250
Please.

246
00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:27.960
Why are you begging me when your fate is in her hands?

247
00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:28.960
I'm so sorry for you.

248
00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:31.559
Please.

249
00:13:31.559 --> 00:13:33.559
Not deserve this apology from you.

250
00:13:33.559 --> 00:13:34.559
The almighty of us.

251
00:13:34.559 --> 00:13:40.129
Mr. Baratheon, I prepared this entire banquet just for you.

252
00:13:40.129 --> 00:13:42.129
Because she disrespected you.

253
00:13:42.129 --> 00:13:47.120
But hey, as a matter of fact, I know that your birthday is around the corner,

254
00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:52.830
I prepared a little gift in exchange for your forgiveness for my little mistake.

255
00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:53.830
Oh, wow.

256
00:13:53.830 --> 00:14:00.620
You know, I would really love to see whatever treasures you've collected.

257
00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:03.620
Bring over the Detective Leap Grandmaster Watch.

258
00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:05.679
It's worth over 31.

259
00:14:05.679 --> 00:14:12.799
Why are you laughing?

260
00:14:12.799 --> 00:14:14.240
That's your gift.

261
00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:17.240
A sitting watch.

262
00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:19.240
What do you have against my watch?

263
00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:29.399
I'm 31 million dollars.

264
00:14:29.399 --> 00:14:33.399
That's more than your entire lifetime of salaries could amount to.

265
00:14:33.399 --> 00:14:34.399
Delivery girl.

266
00:14:34.399 --> 00:14:37.399
What did you get Mr. Baratheon yourself?

267
00:14:37.399 --> 00:14:38.399
Huh?

268
00:14:38.399 --> 00:14:41.399
How about you show us before you start mocking our gifts?

269
00:14:41.399 --> 00:14:43.399
Why would I get Tyrion gifts?

270
00:14:43.399 --> 00:14:50.789
Of course, she has better gifts than you.

271
00:14:50.789 --> 00:14:57.149
Of course, she has better gifts than you.

272
00:14:57.149 --> 00:15:17.409
The original Marvel Statue of the Veiled Lady by Raphael Monty.

273
00:15:17.409 --> 00:15:19.539
The original by Monty.

274
00:15:19.539 --> 00:15:22.639
That's worth 1.5 billion dollars.

275
00:15:22.639 --> 00:15:24.639
That's not just something you can buy.

276
00:15:24.639 --> 00:15:26.639
The Princess Victoria.

277
00:15:26.639 --> 00:15:28.639
The largest cruise ship.

278
00:15:28.639 --> 00:15:29.639
That's it.

279
00:15:29.639 --> 00:15:32.440
Oh my God, that's real.

280
00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:34.440
That's the actual plaque from the Princess Victoria.

281
00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:37.440
It's worth more than two billion dollars.

282
00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:39.440
And the Private Island.

283
00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:41.440
In the Pacific Ocean.

284
00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:50.269
You know, you can't even buy a window on the Princess Victoria

285
00:15:50.269 --> 00:15:52.269
without 31 million dollar watch.

286
00:15:52.269 --> 00:15:53.269
Look at this.

287
00:15:53.269 --> 00:15:55.000
Sir?

288
00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
Give us a better look.

289
00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.210
Do you like the gifts you got from Mr. Baratheon, my dear?

290
00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:03.600
Why, yes.

291
00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:05.600
I got him too good.

292
00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:11.509
Your lies are beginning to be a bit unrealistic.

293
00:16:11.509 --> 00:16:14.149
They're very unbelievable.

294
00:16:14.149 --> 00:16:16.149
The Marvel Statue.

295
00:16:16.149 --> 00:16:19.149
And the Island are both auctioned off by Mr. Stark.

296
00:16:19.149 --> 00:16:22.169
How did Hobo get his hands on these?

297
00:16:22.169 --> 00:16:27.309
How did Hobo get his hands on these?

298
00:16:27.309 --> 00:16:30.309
Don't tell me he's actually Mr. Stark.

299
00:16:30.309 --> 00:16:32.299
Don't worry.

300
00:16:32.299 --> 00:16:34.299
I'll help you cover up for your over exaggerated lies.

301
00:16:34.299 --> 00:16:36.299
They're all real.

302
00:16:36.299 --> 00:16:38.299
Hey, Hobo.

303
00:16:38.299 --> 00:16:41.399
Do you really think you can get away with telling some

304
00:16:41.399 --> 00:16:44.399
random stories by passing off some useless stones

305
00:16:44.399 --> 00:16:46.399
and worthless plaques?

306
00:16:46.399 --> 00:16:49.809
Rian, your broke husband, stole much.

307
00:16:49.809 --> 00:16:51.639
Exactly.

308
00:16:51.639 --> 00:16:54.639
How could this low life have all this?

309
00:16:54.639 --> 00:16:55.639
He's lying.

310
00:16:55.639 --> 00:16:56.679
Told ya.

311
00:16:56.679 --> 00:17:00.889
You fucking nuthead.

312
00:17:00.889 --> 00:17:04.890
You present these fake gifts and you've destroyed

313
00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:07.890
the Sarias's 31 million dollar watch.

314
00:17:07.890 --> 00:17:09.890
You have a death wish.

315
00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:12.890
Calm down, everyone.

316
00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:14.890
It's just a few billion.

317
00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:15.890
My bother.

318
00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:17.890
You arrogant lunatic.

319
00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:20.890
Mr. Baratheon, he is clearly full of shit.

320
00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:22.890
Please kick him out.

321
00:17:22.890 --> 00:17:25.559
I say we banish him.

322
00:17:25.559 --> 00:17:27.559
Make sure he's never seen this country.

323
00:17:27.559 --> 00:17:33.559
Disrespecting Mr. Baratheon is disrespecting all our families.

324
00:17:33.559 --> 00:17:38.079
Well, I'm sure Mr. Baratheon will be able to find out.

325
00:17:38.079 --> 00:17:40.329
Are they really fake?

326
00:17:40.329 --> 00:17:43.329
Is that even necessary?

327
00:17:43.329 --> 00:17:48.329
I swear, with my own eyes, I saw this hobo steal food

328
00:17:48.329 --> 00:17:50.329
from a stray dog.

329
00:17:50.329 --> 00:17:52.430
There's no way he can get started.

330
00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:54.430
Mr. Baratheon, you need to kick him out now.

331
00:17:54.430 --> 00:17:57.430
Else you run the risk of offending the real Mr. Stark

332
00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:59.430
in the entire South.

333
00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:00.430
Shut up.

334
00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:02.960
Let's tell him what to do.

335
00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:24.289
These gifts are genuine.

336
00:18:24.289 --> 00:18:29.750
These gifts are genuine.

337
00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:34.299
Not bad to you.

338
00:18:34.299 --> 00:18:36.299
He really knows how to wing it.

339
00:18:36.299 --> 00:18:39.299
My lady finally has a better eye.

340
00:18:39.299 --> 00:18:41.299
This one is much better than the last.

341
00:18:41.299 --> 00:18:43.839
Oh, is that possible?

342
00:18:43.839 --> 00:18:45.839
He sleeps on the street.

343
00:18:45.839 --> 00:18:48.839
Maybe Mr. Baratheon is long?

344
00:18:48.839 --> 00:18:52.410
I can also hold this on this.

345
00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:53.410
Whatever.

346
00:18:53.410 --> 00:18:56.049
They're from Mr. Baratheon.

347
00:18:56.049 --> 00:18:58.049
Not us.

348
00:18:58.049 --> 00:19:01.920
Who said all these gifts are from Mr. Baratheon?

349
00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:03.920
They're actually from my wife, Brienne.

350
00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:07.039
They're wedding gifts from the House of Stark.

351
00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:12.930
Fitch like Brienne does not deserve these kinds of wedding gifts.

352
00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:13.930
I knew it.

353
00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:15.930
You're just a fucking actor.

354
00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:16.930
You shameless hobo.

355
00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:20.220
Tyrion, I want him to suffer.

356
00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:25.039
You fucking father.

357
00:19:25.039 --> 00:19:34.619
How dare you hit me?

358
00:19:34.619 --> 00:19:35.619
What did I do?

359
00:19:35.619 --> 00:19:39.119
I'm a decent part of this brand.

360
00:19:39.119 --> 00:19:41.119
I ditched this bitch.

361
00:19:41.119 --> 00:19:42.119
Why are you all defending her?

362
00:19:42.119 --> 00:19:43.119
Seriously.

363
00:19:43.119 --> 00:19:59.349
I went for Sarie's Martel Bankrupt.

364
00:19:59.349 --> 00:20:04.559
In three minutes, I went for Sarie's Martel Bankrupt.

365
00:20:04.559 --> 00:20:11.140
Who the hell are you to do that?

366
00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:14.140
Trying to get the Martel family to go bankrupt.

367
00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:16.140
Are you trying to back him up?

368
00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:19.140
Mr. Baratheon, the Sirius has made mistakes.

369
00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:21.140
He's still a talented businessman.

370
00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:22.140
You said so yourself.

371
00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:23.140
He's talented.

372
00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:28.170
This man has gone bankrupt multiple times and I had to save his ass.

373
00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:30.170
Every single time it happens.

374
00:20:30.170 --> 00:20:36.900
Boss, someone is targeting us in a stock market and our company just went bankrupt.

375
00:20:42.799 --> 00:20:44.799
Bankrupting a company in minutes?

376
00:20:44.799 --> 00:20:48.660
Is that hobo really Mr. Stark?

377
00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:50.809
No way.

378
00:20:50.809 --> 00:20:53.809
It must be Mr. Baratheon who did that.

379
00:20:53.809 --> 00:20:54.809
Bankrupt's here.

380
00:20:54.809 --> 00:20:58.349
Isn't the only place you'll be paying.

381
00:20:58.349 --> 00:20:59.480
Boys!

382
00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:00.480
Come on in!

383
00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:06.799
Excuse me, wait.

384
00:21:06.799 --> 00:21:11.799
Send this man to Japan.

385
00:21:11.799 --> 00:21:14.799
He would be great in a porno and I want him to be famous.

386
00:21:14.799 --> 00:21:17.049
Have to you please!

387
00:21:17.049 --> 00:21:18.049
Please!

388
00:21:18.049 --> 00:21:19.049
I don't want to go!

389
00:21:19.049 --> 00:21:20.049
Oh!

390
00:21:20.049 --> 00:21:21.049
Oh!

391
00:21:21.049 --> 00:21:25.869
I need Mr. Baratheon!

392
00:21:25.869 --> 00:21:27.670
Is that enough?

393
00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:30.670
Mr. Baratheon, this is way too much.

394
00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:33.670
Now you kick out a CEO and you let this bum stay.

395
00:21:33.670 --> 00:21:35.670
This is outrageous.

396
00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:46.079
Mr. Lannister, if you have a problem with that, you could join the bankruptcy club too.

397
00:21:46.079 --> 00:21:51.079
If Mr. Baratheon insists then I'm fine with letting the gentlemen stay.

398
00:21:51.079 --> 00:21:56.430
But everyone must pass the credit verification in order to bid, right?

399
00:21:56.430 --> 00:21:57.430
Everyone agrees?

400
00:21:57.430 --> 00:21:58.430
Yeah.

401
00:21:58.430 --> 00:22:06.180
Yes.

402
00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:08.180
These are worth $10 billion.

403
00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:10.180
He'll have no issue with the capital verification.

404
00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:12.180
We'll do it the usual way.

405
00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:21.569
One at a time.

406
00:22:21.569 --> 00:22:23.569
$700 million.

407
00:22:23.569 --> 00:22:24.569
Second class.

408
00:22:24.569 --> 00:22:28.750
$800 million.

409
00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:34.269
Second class.

410
00:22:34.269 --> 00:22:36.269
$900 million.

411
00:22:36.269 --> 00:22:37.269
Second class.

412
00:22:37.269 --> 00:22:42.529
$2 billion.

413
00:22:42.529 --> 00:22:45.240
First class.

414
00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:56.339
The Lannister family is the best among the four of us.

415
00:22:56.339 --> 00:22:58.339
Impressive Lannister.

416
00:22:58.339 --> 00:22:59.339
Yes.

417
00:22:59.339 --> 00:23:00.339
I agree.

418
00:23:00.339 --> 00:23:02.400
Here.

419
00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:04.589
You can use my card.

420
00:23:04.589 --> 00:23:07.410
Don't worry.

421
00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:08.569
I got this.

422
00:23:08.569 --> 00:23:14.589
Five black cards from the prestigious Targaryen Bank.

423
00:23:14.589 --> 00:23:17.130
Mr. Stark?

424
00:23:17.130 --> 00:23:19.680
The Targaryen banks.

425
00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:21.680
Black VIP cards.

426
00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:23.680
They're only five available worldwide.

427
00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:25.680
I can't even get my hand on one of them.

428
00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:26.680
That's pretty bold.

429
00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:29.680
Actually, that's quite fucking dumb to claim that you have all five.

430
00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:31.680
That's right.

431
00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:33.680
Don't make things up.

432
00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:35.680
Five black cards?

433
00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:37.680
Do you think we are stupid?

434
00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:42.640
If I'm lying, we'll find out soon enough.

435
00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:46.109
I'll officiate.

436
00:23:46.109 --> 00:23:47.109
I'll officiate.

437
00:23:47.109 --> 00:23:49.460
Hey, no.

438
00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:53.720
My husband seems to have sashed some money only on those cards.

439
00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:54.720
Please.

440
00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:56.200
Use this one.

441
00:23:56.200 --> 00:24:00.200
It's just a normal bank card, but it should contain a little more than the Lannisters.

442
00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:02.200
What's that thing?

443
00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:03.200
I have a question.

444
00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:05.200
Did you two get married in a Sanisiah?

445
00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:06.200
Because you're nuts.

446
00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:08.200
I dare you to swipe that card.

447
00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:12.529
Stay quiet behind me, darling.

448
00:24:12.529 --> 00:24:13.529
Don't worry.

449
00:24:13.529 --> 00:24:14.529
Your balance is enough.

450
00:24:14.529 --> 00:24:16.529
I can't cover up for your toy cards.

451
00:24:16.529 --> 00:24:18.529
You don't have to act like your card is real.

452
00:24:18.529 --> 00:24:19.529
I got this.

453
00:24:19.529 --> 00:24:20.529
I could say the same thing to you.

454
00:24:20.529 --> 00:24:22.660
What are you two stammering about?

455
00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:23.660
What?

456
00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:24.660
You're gonna shake your pants?

457
00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:25.660
Shut up, Lannister.

458
00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:28.660
Mr. Stark is speaking to his wife.

459
00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:31.200
Don't do that.

460
00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:33.200
Rando, stop the act.

461
00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:38.200
We know you're just a delivery girl and a hobo.

462
00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:43.200
I have Mr. Stark's brother, Stannis, is in the North right now as well.

463
00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:47.200
Why don't we ask Stannis to come see his brother?

464
00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:49.200
I second that.

465
00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:50.200
Stannis is close by.

466
00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:52.200
He could just cop over.

467
00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:55.809
No, if Stannis comes, I won't be able to cover up for you in the highs.

468
00:24:55.809 --> 00:24:57.809
I heard he's really intense.

469
00:24:57.809 --> 00:25:00.809
Mr. Wrathion, please swipe it from me.

470
00:25:00.809 --> 00:25:15.960
One hundred billion.

471
00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:17.819
Splatter no.

472
00:25:17.819 --> 00:25:27.119
I believe I've never seen a class platinum.

473
00:25:27.119 --> 00:25:29.119
I'm a Lannister and I'm only first class.

474
00:25:29.119 --> 00:25:32.160
How could you, an ordinary girl, be a platinum?

475
00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:34.160
Don't tell me.

476
00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:37.160
She's a lady from the Targaryen family for real.

477
00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:40.160
That would explain why Mr. Baratheon keeps defending her.

478
00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:43.160
Have we offended the lady?

479
00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:46.160
She's really a Targaryen in secret.

480
00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:52.539
Oh, well that makes sense now.

481
00:25:52.539 --> 00:25:56.539
This explains how a delivery girl could have a hundred billion dollars.

482
00:25:56.539 --> 00:25:58.539
The machine is broken.

483
00:25:58.539 --> 00:25:59.700
What?

484
00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:00.700
It's broken?

485
00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:02.880
A broken machine?

486
00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:05.329
A broken machine is with you.

487
00:26:05.329 --> 00:26:07.400
It's not my fault, lady.

488
00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:10.400
The machine has never seen this much money before.

489
00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:11.779
Makes sense.

490
00:26:11.779 --> 00:26:12.779
The machine's broken.

491
00:26:12.779 --> 00:26:14.809
She got pretty lucky though.

492
00:26:14.809 --> 00:26:17.259
This is all part of your scheme.

493
00:26:17.259 --> 00:26:20.259
You knew it was broken.

494
00:26:20.259 --> 00:26:22.259
You're sly for your age.

495
00:26:22.259 --> 00:26:24.259
You know you almost fooled us.

496
00:26:24.259 --> 00:26:26.259
Someone get us another machine.

497
00:26:26.259 --> 00:26:29.119
I dare you to do that again.

498
00:26:29.119 --> 00:26:31.119
Delivery girl.

499
00:26:31.119 --> 00:26:34.299
I have nothing to do.

500
00:26:34.299 --> 00:26:36.299
Swipe my card.

501
00:26:36.299 --> 00:26:49.170
Class Platinum.

502
00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:50.170
Class Platinum.

503
00:26:50.170 --> 00:26:51.359
Class Platinum.

504
00:26:51.359 --> 00:26:52.359
Class Platinum.

505
00:26:52.359 --> 00:27:00.369
Class Platinum.

506
00:27:00.369 --> 00:27:01.369
Class Platinum.

507
00:27:01.369 --> 00:27:02.369
Class Platinum.

508
00:27:02.369 --> 00:27:13.680
Tea really rocks.

509
00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:15.680
He prepared fake machines ahead of time.

510
00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:16.680
So well thought out.

511
00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:18.680
No wonder my dad loved them.

512
00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:19.680
Lannister?

513
00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:20.910
Anything else?

514
00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:22.910
This machine is brand now.

515
00:27:22.910 --> 00:27:25.099
That's impossible.

516
00:27:25.099 --> 00:27:27.099
I don't know how that happened.

517
00:27:27.099 --> 00:27:32.099
I mean, how could this hobo have the black platinum card?

518
00:27:32.099 --> 00:27:34.099
You must have found them in the trash.

519
00:27:34.099 --> 00:27:35.099
I told you.

520
00:27:35.099 --> 00:27:37.099
I'm Jaime Stark.

521
00:27:37.099 --> 00:27:39.099
The head of the Stark household.

522
00:27:39.099 --> 00:27:41.099
It's no wonder I have these cards.

523
00:27:41.099 --> 00:27:45.099
You know, sometimes I wonder how you idiots are even my competition.

524
00:27:45.099 --> 00:27:47.099
You want more proof?

525
00:27:47.099 --> 00:27:52.099
Did you know that at every Stark hotel is a secret passageway?

526
00:27:52.099 --> 00:27:55.099
And only the CEO knows the key word to them.

527
00:27:55.099 --> 00:28:00.940
What are you trying to say?

528
00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:02.940
You're too stupid to ask questions.

529
00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:07.019
He's really lost in the story again.

530
00:28:07.019 --> 00:28:08.019
Can you please cover us?

531
00:28:08.019 --> 00:28:09.019
I have to get him out of here.

532
00:28:09.019 --> 00:28:14.789
Hang on.

533
00:28:14.789 --> 00:28:15.789
They hit it off?

534
00:28:15.789 --> 00:28:35.269
If he knows the key word password, then he is Mr. Stark.

535
00:28:35.269 --> 00:28:38.269
The pattern on this lock is from the Stark family.

536
00:28:38.269 --> 00:28:40.430
This is a secret passageway.

537
00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:53.500
Mr. Stark.

538
00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:58.640
Mr. Stark.

539
00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:11.900
We married some random person.

540
00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:14.900
Turns out it was the South's richest bachelor.

541
00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:16.930
If you're lucky now.

542
00:29:16.930 --> 00:29:19.990
You can't say I don't.

543
00:29:19.990 --> 00:29:22.559
Mr. Stark.

544
00:29:22.559 --> 00:29:27.559
Lannister fooled me into thinking you both were intruders.

545
00:29:27.559 --> 00:29:31.559
I never meant to offend you and your wife.

546
00:29:31.559 --> 00:29:32.559
Me neither, Mr. Stark.

547
00:29:32.559 --> 00:29:34.559
I was in stupid.

548
00:29:34.559 --> 00:29:35.559
Lady Bran.

549
00:29:35.559 --> 00:29:40.200
I am so sorry.

550
00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:44.089
It was Lannister's fault.

551
00:29:44.089 --> 00:29:46.089
I'm just a delivery dog.

552
00:29:46.089 --> 00:29:49.829
You know how we wound creatures like darkness.

553
00:29:49.829 --> 00:29:51.829
You are all assholes.

554
00:29:51.829 --> 00:29:52.829
That's enough.

555
00:29:52.829 --> 00:29:54.829
All of you are idiots.

556
00:29:54.829 --> 00:29:56.829
Stupid enough to be fooled.

557
00:29:56.829 --> 00:29:57.829
I know.

558
00:29:57.829 --> 00:30:00.829
I think it's time to make a change within the North's upper echelon.

559
00:30:00.829 --> 00:30:02.829
What do you think, Mr. Baratheon?

560
00:30:02.829 --> 00:30:04.829
Mr. Stark is right.

561
00:30:04.829 --> 00:30:12.599
From this day forward, any company that deals with Stark or Baratheon will no longer do business with your four families.

562
00:30:12.599 --> 00:30:14.599
We'll make you bankrupt.

563
00:30:14.599 --> 00:30:16.599
Go forward, Mr. Baratheon.

564
00:30:16.599 --> 00:30:17.599
Of course.

565
00:30:17.599 --> 00:30:22.819
Since they can't place the bed, the Stark group?

566
00:30:22.819 --> 00:30:24.819
Run the project.

567
00:30:24.819 --> 00:30:25.819
This is bullshit.

568
00:30:25.819 --> 00:30:26.819
Oh no.

569
00:30:26.819 --> 00:30:27.819
No.

570
00:30:27.819 --> 00:30:28.819
Come on.

571
00:30:28.819 --> 00:30:31.849
You better watch your back.

572
00:30:31.849 --> 00:30:40.599
Bran!

573
00:30:40.599 --> 00:30:44.799
Sorry.

574
00:30:44.799 --> 00:30:57.970
The Duke personally picked out these strippers for you.

575
00:30:57.970 --> 00:31:01.970
And you got married out of word and your father is worried about your happiness.

576
00:31:01.970 --> 00:31:03.359
You're snitching on me?

577
00:31:03.359 --> 00:31:04.359
No, no, no.

578
00:31:04.359 --> 00:31:05.359
That's not what I'm trying to say.

579
00:31:05.359 --> 00:31:07.359
I'm trying to hear to help you and how you don't understand.

580
00:31:07.359 --> 00:31:13.799
No, no.

581
00:31:13.799 --> 00:31:15.799
How come she's so close with Mr. Baratheon.

582
00:31:15.799 --> 00:31:16.799
She is love her.

583
00:31:16.799 --> 00:31:18.829
My dad has bad taste.

584
00:31:18.829 --> 00:31:21.849
These strippers have nothing on my husband.

585
00:31:21.849 --> 00:31:27.160
I'm married, so we can get this nonsense over with.

586
00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:30.470
My lady, I will talk to the Duke personally.

587
00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:36.500
This is all your fault, Bran.

588
00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:38.500
You're dead if I see you again.

589
00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:47.859
What are you doing here?

590
00:31:47.859 --> 00:31:49.859
Aren't you about the shooting porn?

591
00:31:49.859 --> 00:31:52.789
Bran, I'm so sorry.

592
00:31:52.789 --> 00:31:53.789
I love you, Bran.

593
00:31:53.789 --> 00:31:54.789
Marjory fooled me.

594
00:31:54.789 --> 00:31:56.789
Have you been hitting the head?

595
00:31:56.789 --> 00:32:00.140
Do you not forget how you just insulted me?

596
00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:02.140
What is wrong with you?

597
00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:04.140
Bran, it's all Marjory's fault.

598
00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:05.140
You're so good to me.

599
00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:07.140
How could I not love you?

600
00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:09.140
Please, I can be yours again.

601
00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:15.400
Love not the other woman you cheat her?

602
00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:17.460
Leave me alone.

603
00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:20.579
Bran, Bran, have you forgotten?

604
00:32:20.579 --> 00:32:22.900
I saved your life three years ago.

605
00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:25.220
This is not how you should repay someone.

606
00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:27.380
You piece of shit.

607
00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:30.380
I would have rather you left me on the curb.

608
00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:34.380
And I've done enough to repay you for everything you've done.

609
00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:36.380
You're pathetic.

610
00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:37.380
Leave me alone.

611
00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:41.470
Or I will cut your limbs off.

612
00:32:41.470 --> 00:32:43.470
You're so grateful, bitch.

613
00:32:43.470 --> 00:32:45.880
I saved your life.

614
00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:47.880
You're so shameless, Viserys.

615
00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:49.880
Taking credit for things you didn't do.

616
00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:53.710
What are you talking about?

617
00:32:53.710 --> 00:32:55.710
A brian don't listen to this playboy.

618
00:32:55.710 --> 00:32:57.710
Halloween three years ago.

619
00:32:57.710 --> 00:32:59.960
I had a flight to catch.

620
00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:02.960
So I had my men take breed of the hospital after I saved her.

621
00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:06.250
I never thought someone else would take credit for something.

622
00:33:06.250 --> 00:33:07.250
The audacity.

623
00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:09.250
You were the one that saved me?

624
00:33:09.250 --> 00:33:11.250
Whoa, whoa, whoa, brian.

625
00:33:11.250 --> 00:33:12.250
Don't listen to him.

626
00:33:12.250 --> 00:33:17.250
For three years, you dishonored and manipulated her for things you didn't do.

627
00:33:17.250 --> 00:33:19.250
That's unforgivable.

628
00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:20.250
Nonsense!

629
00:33:20.250 --> 00:33:23.480
Brianne, I took you to the hospital.

630
00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:24.480
You saw me there.

631
00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:25.480
Really?

632
00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:26.480
Really?

633
00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:28.480
How many of her bones were broken then?

634
00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:29.480
What do you care?

635
00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:30.480
Fine.

636
00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:32.480
It was three.

637
00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:33.670
Period.

638
00:33:33.670 --> 00:33:36.670
You don't even know about my injuries.

639
00:33:36.670 --> 00:33:40.759
And I was stupid enough to do everything for you for three years.

640
00:33:40.759 --> 00:33:41.759
So what?

641
00:33:41.759 --> 00:33:43.759
I bet he doesn't know either.

642
00:33:43.759 --> 00:33:45.759
She had abdominal injuries.

643
00:33:45.759 --> 00:33:47.960
I hired Dr. Catree.

644
00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:51.369
We're the best surgeons in the world to take care of.

645
00:33:51.369 --> 00:33:53.369
Let's see who saved me.

646
00:33:53.369 --> 00:33:54.819
He's a trap.

647
00:33:54.819 --> 00:33:55.819
He's lying about the doctors.

648
00:33:55.819 --> 00:33:56.819
Brianne.

649
00:33:56.819 --> 00:33:58.819
We don't know.

650
00:33:58.819 --> 00:34:00.269
Know what?

651
00:34:00.269 --> 00:34:02.839
This is Mr. Stark.

652
00:34:02.839 --> 00:34:04.839
The CEO of the Stark Groot?

653
00:34:04.839 --> 00:34:09.500
The richest man in the South.

654
00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:11.500
I don't believe this.

655
00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:12.500
Mr. Stark is in the South?

656
00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:14.500
There's no way he's here.

657
00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:15.500
Gart.

658
00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:18.110
Throw this man in the sea.

659
00:34:18.110 --> 00:34:20.110
The whales and feasts at Brianne.

660
00:34:20.110 --> 00:34:21.110
Brianne.

661
00:34:21.110 --> 00:34:22.110
I love you.

662
00:34:22.110 --> 00:34:23.110
Three years, Brianne.

663
00:34:23.110 --> 00:34:24.110
Wait.

664
00:34:24.110 --> 00:34:29.039
What?

665
00:34:29.039 --> 00:34:32.460
Does my wife still have feelings for this scumbag?

666
00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:37.059
I never want to see him again.

667
00:34:37.059 --> 00:34:41.110
Take him to Antarctica.

668
00:34:41.110 --> 00:34:42.110
No, no, no.

669
00:34:42.110 --> 00:34:44.110
You're going to regret this Brianne.

670
00:34:44.110 --> 00:34:45.139
Please!

671
00:34:45.139 --> 00:35:04.889
Let me go!

672
00:35:04.889 --> 00:35:05.889
Should we really stop drinking?

673
00:35:05.889 --> 00:35:09.940
Am I so stupid?

674
00:35:09.940 --> 00:35:14.190
I never suspected anything for three years.

675
00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:15.190
It's not your fault.

676
00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:16.190
It's my fault.

677
00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:18.190
I should have never left you alone.

678
00:35:18.190 --> 00:35:19.190
Yeah.

679
00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:21.760
Your fault.

680
00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:28.929
You know.

681
00:35:28.929 --> 00:35:44.460
What?

682
00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:46.590
You're just going to leave me hanging?

683
00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:50.929
This should be enough to repay for your services tonight.

684
00:35:50.929 --> 00:35:51.929
Keep the change.

685
00:35:51.929 --> 00:35:52.929
Canada's a...

686
00:35:52.929 --> 00:35:54.639
Great.

687
00:35:54.639 --> 00:35:55.639
I don't want your money.

688
00:35:55.639 --> 00:36:00.099
I really like you.

689
00:36:00.099 --> 00:36:02.199
Well, I believe in the old saying.

690
00:36:02.199 --> 00:36:04.199
Wise men never fall in love.

691
00:36:04.199 --> 00:36:05.199
Feelings are vague.

692
00:36:05.199 --> 00:36:14.840
Well, this.

693
00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:18.800
This isn't enough to buy me.

694
00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:26.760
Can't charge that much, even if you're a hot CEO.

695
00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:27.760
Get out!

696
00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:50.780
You know, Aunt Ben would trust another man again.

697
00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:53.800
That cheater of a series.

698
00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:56.059
Or that scammer, Jamie.

699
00:36:56.059 --> 00:37:07.199
My lady.

700
00:37:07.199 --> 00:37:16.909
My lady.

701
00:37:16.909 --> 00:37:17.909
What did Jamie do?

702
00:37:17.909 --> 00:37:23.739
Don't worry.

703
00:37:23.739 --> 00:37:24.739
I will take care of it.

704
00:37:24.739 --> 00:37:31.119
I'll make sure...

705
00:37:31.119 --> 00:37:35.900
Hello?

706
00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:38.480
How dare you upset my lady.

707
00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:39.480
I will not be intimidated.

708
00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:58.559
Even if these are richest men in the South.

709
00:37:58.559 --> 00:37:59.559
I'm sorry.

710
00:37:59.559 --> 00:38:02.780
Even you are unbelievable.

711
00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:05.000
My lady is upset.

712
00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:25.119
Mr. Baratheon?

713
00:38:25.119 --> 00:38:28.409
Mr. Stark.

714
00:38:28.409 --> 00:38:30.889
What a coincidence.

715
00:38:30.889 --> 00:38:37.719
Mr. Baratheon.

716
00:38:37.719 --> 00:38:40.809
Mr. Stark.

717
00:38:40.809 --> 00:38:43.130
What a coincidence.

718
00:38:43.130 --> 00:38:45.130
What are you doing with that?

719
00:38:45.130 --> 00:38:48.030
My work is stressful.

720
00:38:48.030 --> 00:38:53.829
And I like to unwind by recycling bottles.

721
00:38:53.829 --> 00:38:55.829
What are you doing here all alone?

722
00:38:55.829 --> 00:38:58.280
You know, who's that woman?

723
00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:01.280
You just got married and you're out having an affair?

724
00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:02.280
It's my wife.

725
00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:03.280
She kicked me out.

726
00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:06.280
She said our relationship is a romantic scam.

727
00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:08.280
Oh, a romantic scam.

728
00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:11.280
Look, my feelings for her are genuine.

729
00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:13.789
For some reason she doesn't believe me.

730
00:39:13.789 --> 00:39:14.880
How do you feel about her?

731
00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:19.519
Look, I've seen a lot of women attracted to her.

732
00:39:19.519 --> 00:39:24.480
What if she asked for dessert?

733
00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:25.480
I don't know.

734
00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:28.480
I buy her every dessert store in the city.

735
00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:32.480
So she could have a dessert every single day.

736
00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:34.599
What if she says it's too hot in the summer?

737
00:39:34.599 --> 00:39:37.599
We'll go on vacation to the North Pole.

738
00:39:37.599 --> 00:39:39.599
What if she says it's too cold in the winter?

739
00:39:39.599 --> 00:39:41.639
We'll buy her a tropical island.

740
00:39:41.639 --> 00:39:43.639
What if she asked for the stars?

741
00:39:43.639 --> 00:39:45.639
The stars?

742
00:39:45.639 --> 00:39:52.320
I don't know what if I could do anything about the stars.

743
00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:57.280
But I'll invest in NASA and as soon as possible,

744
00:39:57.280 --> 00:39:59.659
I'll take her to Mars.

745
00:39:59.659 --> 00:40:00.690
NASA?

746
00:40:00.690 --> 00:40:01.690
Mars?

747
00:40:01.690 --> 00:40:10.630
Mr. Stark.

748
00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:15.289
I can see that you truly care about Brienne.

749
00:40:15.289 --> 00:40:20.320
Perhaps I can give you some advice.

750
00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:21.760
Maybe.

751
00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:27.530
Just maybe Brienne is pushing you away because an asshole broke her arm.

752
00:40:27.530 --> 00:40:29.530
If you stick around.
