00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.280
Are you jealous?

2
00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:03.040
Why would I be jealous?

3
00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.879
I'm just mad you're a bad delivery guy who

4
00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:06.080
flirts with customers.

5
00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.120
Work ethic matters.

6
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.359
Does it bother you?

7
00:00:09.359 --> 00:00:11.919
Uh, stop trying to be slick and get back to work.

8
00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:20.559
Well, we picked up so many at once.

9
00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:23.629
There must be a robot arm under here, right?

10
00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:24.989
Let me see.

11
00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:36.820
I have a surprise for you.

12
00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.020
My grandma called and she's so happy that we just got married.

13
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.780
I want to take you to my family dinner mom.

14
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.719
But you're just fake.

15
00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:45.520
Fake?

16
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:46.079
So what?

17
00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.159
You're just going to use me and ghost me?

18
00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:49.679
No, no, no, I said I'd pay him.

19
00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.880
Please honey, I was the least favorite child growing up

20
00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.600
and my grandma she only cares about my brothers.

21
00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:01.119
Nobody ever thought I'd get married to a beautiful girl like you.

22
00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:02.909
Damn it.

23
00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.379
I'll go with you tomorrow and I'll show you that no one in this world

24
00:01:08.379 --> 00:01:09.739
will you, except for me.

25
00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:13.459
You're the best, babe.

26
00:01:14.099 --> 00:01:15.780
Alright, can you put me down?

27
00:01:19.379 --> 00:01:25.230
Wait, I bet I can't carry you all the way home just like this.
