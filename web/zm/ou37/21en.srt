1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,259
That's bullshit!

2
00:00:02,259 --> 00:00:05,980
How dare you accuse me of something so horrible!

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:08,640
What's going on?

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,599
Grandma, that is why I presented you with the cream,

5
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:14,599
because the powder you're wearing right now is poison.

6
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:16,079
How can I be?

7
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:21,600
That was a prestigious royal product that Melanie bought from me.

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,519
No, I'm sorry, but that is a carcinogenic talcum powder.

9
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,199
That's BS!

10
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:30,100
They are from exclusive salons.

11
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:33,340
Trailer trash like you wouldn't know if it would be different.

12
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:35,659
Exclusive salons?

13
00:00:35,659 --> 00:00:37,390
No!

14
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:39,850
Stannis rented out the warehouse at Shif's house.

15
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:41,770
Stannis, is that true?

16
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:45,329
Grandma, I have no idea what this bitch is talking about.

17
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:46,689
How do you know that?

18
00:00:46,689 --> 00:00:49,490
You don't have to make things up just to defend me.

19
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:51,929
Don't worry, it's 100% true.

20
00:00:51,929 --> 00:00:55,229
Oh, what the hell do you know you tramp delivery girl?

21
00:00:55,229 --> 00:00:57,329
Stop spreading this shit!

22
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:09,920
So this, is Stannis' order for talcum powder.

23
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,000
And this is Melanie's order for an empty powder tin.

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,680
How did you get that?

25
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,870
I have colleagues that are more than happy to do me a favor.

26
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:22,390
Her connections are scary.

27
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:30,849
Never rub couriers the wrong way.

28
00:01:30,849 --> 00:01:34,609
Grandma, don't believe her!

29
00:01:34,609 --> 00:01:36,209
This is fake!

30
00:01:36,209 --> 00:01:40,010
Stannis, this is your handwriting!

31
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:43,469
Grandma, even if I got an empty box,

32
00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:46,109
who's to say it's filled with talcum powder?

33
00:01:46,109 --> 00:01:48,420
You'd have to test it.

34
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,579
I know how to test it.
