00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:13.880
She bullies you, and yet you're still taking care of her.

2
00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.880
You don't understand.

3
00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:21.039
When I was born, the fortune teller said I'd bring death to everyone in my family.

4
00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:25.730
No one likes that.

5
00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:37.969
You must add a hard time growing up.

6
00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:44.280
No one only seems to care that I found at the Golden Core when I was 17, except for you.

7
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.619
You seem to care about me.

8
00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:50.619
Well, you're my husband.

9
00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:52.710
Well, what about you?

10
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.710
I've never met anybody in your family.

11
00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.409
Did you have a hard time, too?

12
00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:00.409
My dad likes to disappear a lot.

13
00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:06.500
I guess he's out traveling the world, but he always sends people to watch over me when he's all around.

14
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.980
And without them finding the evidence wouldn't have been so easy.

15
00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.909
You gotta stop lying about being a Targaryen honey.

16
00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:20.909
My men, they're upset at you, and not even the Golden Core can protect you from the Targaryens rage.

17
00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.980
We'll really be homeless.

18
00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.980
I'm not lying.

19
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.980
You'll see when you meet my dad at our wedding.

20
00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:54.530
He seems yummy.

21
00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.530
Brie, I'm here. No rush.

22
00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:17.539
Sir, good year.
