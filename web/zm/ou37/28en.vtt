1
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.560
These wounds took over a week to heal.

2
00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:32.270
A nice bag.

3
00:00:33.359 --> 00:00:38.560
If only I wasn't just a student sponsored by Duke Targaryen, but his real daughter.

4
00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.880
Isn't she the one who was shopping with Lord Targaryen the other day?

5
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.200
She must be the Lady Targaryen.

6
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.679
My Lady, this is from our recent collection.

7
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.079
It looks perfect on you.

8
00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.880
It's only $800,000.

9
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.679
For you, that's just like some snack money.

10
00:00:58.799 --> 00:01:01.200
I was mistaken for the Lady again.

11
00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:03.280
Too bad I can't afford this.

12
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.030
A little bird told me Lady Targaryen likes to shop around.

13
00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.150
She surely looks like her.

14
00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.700
My Lady, why are you so careless?

15
00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:22.700
Your shoes are covered in bed.

16
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.180
Good job.

17
00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:33.359
What's your name?

18
00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:42.739
On the series, I managed to get an invitation to the wedding of my former ex-girlfriend and Jamie

19
00:01:42.739 --> 00:01:47.950
Stark. I'll do anything you ask if you help me get back at them, my Lady.
