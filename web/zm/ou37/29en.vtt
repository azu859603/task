1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I'll do anything you ask if you help me get back into my waiting.

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.179
That bag is only $800,000.

3
00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:13.529
Buy it for me, then consider it.

4
00:00:13.529 --> 00:00:16.530
I swam so hard to get here from the North Pole.

5
00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.530
If Lady Targaryen helps me, I can have my revenge.

6
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.359
He bought it?

7
00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:25.359
Guess I'll pretend to be Lady Targaryen just once.

8
00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:29.519
I can donate my kidney to your dad for $800,000.

9
00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.530
Excuse me, Ness. What are you taking, Ness?

10
00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.799
What do you say, my lady?

11
00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:45.520
I can't wait to paint this wedding, Rad.

12
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.520
Consider the wedding crimson.

13
00:00:47.520 --> 00:01:00.640
Ladies and gentlemen, here is our bride.

14
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.640
Miss Bran, do you take Mr. Jamie's hand in marriage?

15
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:05.640
I do.

16
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.700
I object.

17
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:13.390
I object.

18
00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.150
The series!

19
00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.280
Checked this wedding.

20
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.280
Why is this mad man here?

21
00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.280
Great. Draw him out.

22
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.569
Touch me from there.

23
00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:27.730
Tick. Tick.

24
00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:32.099
Go!

25
00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:34.510
Yeah. Looks pretty big.

26
00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:39.079
Breathe. You traitor!

27
00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:41.079
You bankrupt me and threw me out to see.

28
00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:44.689
You know I can't swim. I almost drowned.

29
00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:46.689
You were too merciful, weren't you?

30
00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:47.689
You should have time into a rock.

31
00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:48.689
Guess I was too kind, darling.

32
00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.689
Don't start flirting here.

33
00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:52.689
I can blow up everyone in your pieces.

34
00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:55.689
Are you crazy? All of my men are here.

35
00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:57.849
Hmm. I'm not here.

36
00:01:57.849 --> 00:02:00.849
The Starks have nothing on Lady Targaryen.

37
00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:03.420
Me?

38
00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.989
Lady Targaryen!

39
00:02:04.989 --> 00:02:19.300
Isn't the groom that hot guy I couldn't sleep with?

40
00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.900
I've got to have him this time.

41
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.900
The woman from the hotel?

42
00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.900
I won't let her ruin my wedding with Breein.

43
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.900
She wanted to sleep with my man, and now she's impersonating me?

44
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.900
Greetings to you all.

45
00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.900
I'm Lady Targaryen.

46
00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.000
Targaryens have half of the world's wealth.

47
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Compared to the Starks, they're just minions.

48
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
While that is true, she's not Lady Targaryen.

49
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
How are you still going on with the Star Targaryen act?

50
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Are you serious? I looked into it. She's the real deal.

51
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
You're nothing but a trailer trash.

52
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Bitch! Do not disrespect outwardly.

53
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.419
Who's talking? I'll blow everyone in here!

54
00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:04.419
Wait! No one needs to die on my wedding day.

55
00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:07.419
You want money? Fine. You can have it.

56
00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:10.699
No. No, my man will be here soon.

57
00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:14.599
I want to see how far he can go.

58
00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:16.599
He's still talking shit, huh?

59
00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:19.599
Whoa! Have fun getting married now!

60
00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:21.620
Bittery!

61
00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.189
Wait. I have a better idea.

62
00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:31.289
Get your ex in hell, and the groom can stay in heaven with me.

63
00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:35.639
Jamie, why don't you marry me instead?

64
00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:39.639
I'll make sure the rest of your life is beyond comfortable.

65
00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:43.639
Fuck it. Even a one-night stand with him is worth it.

66
00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:47.639
You know I can tell you're lying? I can see it in your eyes.

67
00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:51.639
Even if you are Lady Targaryen, I'm not going to betray my wife.

68
00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:52.639
Just for that one.

69
00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:59.219
Captain, please marry Lady Targaryen.

70
00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:06.219
Please marry Lady Targaryen.

71
00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:09.689
Fairies. Captain.

72
00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:12.939
Only Lady Targaryen is worthy of you.

73
00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:15.039
How can you marry this trash?

74
00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.259
But I am Lady Targaryen.

75
00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:21.579
You have been with your captain.

76
00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:23.699
You liar.

77
00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:27.310
Jamie is the captain of the Golden Corpse.

78
00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:31.470
But still, he's got nothing on Lady Targaryen.

79
00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:32.470
I still have the upper hand.

80
00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.889
He's the captain?

81
00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:36.889
I'll be rich if he's mine.

82
00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:39.889
How could you marry this trashy nobody?

83
00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:41.949
I'm perfect for you.

84
00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:43.949
You're such an imposter.

85
00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:46.949
You know, I know that you want my man and my identity.

86
00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:49.949
But maybe in the next life, you could be a Targaryen.

87
00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:53.300
Imposter. Me?

88
00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.389
The Targaryens run the world.

89
00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:01.389
And your man is mine too.

90
00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:05.319
Brie, don't listen to her.

91
00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:08.920
You're the only one that matters to me.

92
00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.920
I like the little competition.

93
00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.920
Especially for my handsome man.

94
00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:19.139
My Lady, we're here to kill them, not hunt for boys.

95
00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:20.519
Shut up.

96
00:05:20.519 --> 00:05:21.550
That's enough.

97
00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:25.550
Lady Targaryen, this is your last chance to leave with this scumbag,

98
00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.550
or else you'll pay the price.

99
00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.550
See, you think she actually loves you?

100
00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:33.550
If I pay her well enough, I'm sure she'll leave.

101
00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.939
Really?

102
00:05:35.939 --> 00:05:38.060
Yeah.

103
00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:43.170
I dare you to say that again.

104
00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:44.170
You.

105
00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:47.899
It's over.

106
00:05:47.899 --> 00:05:49.899
She's the real Lady Targaryen.

107
00:05:49.899 --> 00:05:53.949
But it seems no one here knows it.

108
00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:55.949
You're just Tyrion's lover.

109
00:05:55.949 --> 00:05:58.949
How dare you talk back to me?

110
00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:02.050
You're Tyrion's lover?

111
00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:06.839
Tyrion must have sent you to fool the captain.

112
00:06:06.839 --> 00:06:08.839
How did you get to be second in command?

113
00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:10.420
You're so welcome.

114
00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:13.670
Varys, I know Briean better than anyone.

115
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:15.670
Those are just rumors.

116
00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:18.670
Captain, this woman is not good enough for you.

117
00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:20.670
Know your place, Varys.

118
00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:26.050
My Lady, please help us.

119
00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:30.100
Please get rid of this bitch.

120
00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:34.100
If we killed Lady Targaryen and blamed it on the Golden Corps,

121
00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:38.100
maybe I'll inherit the Duke's fortune as his only adopted daughter.

122
00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:42.199
Golden Corps.

123
00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:44.199
You can do anything.

124
00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:46.199
The Targaryens will back you up.

125
00:06:46.199 --> 00:07:00.709
Kill Briean!

126
00:07:00.709 --> 00:07:02.709
It's my gift for Captain.

127
00:07:02.709 --> 00:07:05.740
It's a sacred sword that frees souls.

128
00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:08.740
If you really love Captain, kill yourself with it.

129
00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:14.050
And set Captain free.

130
00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:15.050
Oh, I see.

131
00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:21.250
You all want me to kill myself.

132
00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:29.360
My Lady, no!

133
00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:39.490
My Lady, you join with that sword.

134
00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:41.490
You do not have to kill yourself at your own wedding.

135
00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:43.490
The Duke has laid that rush to it gifts.

136
00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:46.220
It looks so good with my outfit.

137
00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:48.220
I mean, come on, I'll ride with the sword.

138
00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:49.769
Cool, right?

139
00:07:49.769 --> 00:07:51.769
My Lady, they want you dead.

140
00:07:51.769 --> 00:07:54.149
It's no time for jokes.

141
00:07:54.149 --> 00:08:00.269
Ridiculous.

142
00:08:00.269 --> 00:08:03.519
This is the great Lady Targaryen.

143
00:08:03.519 --> 00:08:06.509
How dare you try to kill her?

144
00:08:06.509 --> 00:08:07.509
You are Lady Targaryen.

145
00:08:07.509 --> 00:08:08.509
No way.

146
00:08:08.509 --> 00:08:12.389
I didn't have to decide.

147
00:08:12.389 --> 00:08:13.389
Lady Targaryen.

148
00:08:13.389 --> 00:08:16.389
It's about a woman just now as a foster.

149
00:08:16.389 --> 00:08:20.389
She's too natural to be a foster, right?

150
00:08:20.389 --> 00:08:22.389
Mr. Baratheon, you told us before.

151
00:08:22.389 --> 00:08:24.389
She's just a delivery girl.

152
00:08:24.389 --> 00:08:27.620
There's no way she could be a Targaryen.

153
00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:29.620
Yeah, these must be a lie.

154
00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:31.970
How dare you to tortoise my Lady's name?

155
00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:34.539
I will not spare you.

156
00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:35.539
Even if you're from the court.

157
00:08:35.539 --> 00:08:38.250
Mr. Baratheon.

158
00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:41.250
I know I saw you that day with Briean.

159
00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:42.250
She's her lover.

160
00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:43.250
I don't...

161
00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:49.940
Mr. Baratheon.

162
00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:51.940
So she nearly is his lover, right?

163
00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:54.200
It's a slut.

164
00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.200
She hooked up with the richest man in the North.

165
00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.200
And then this out.

166
00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.220
Oh.

167
00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:01.220
See?

168
00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:03.700
Her name is Ari Tarr.

169
00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:06.799
Briean the fucking slut.

170
00:09:06.799 --> 00:09:07.799
But serious.

171
00:09:07.799 --> 00:09:09.799
I was too easy on you before.

172
00:09:09.799 --> 00:09:11.799
I should have sent you the hell.

173
00:09:11.799 --> 00:09:15.840
I have a Targaryen.

174
00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.840
Show me what you got.

175
00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:26.529
Lady, what are you doing?

176
00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:52.759
I'm so glad you're finally here.

177
00:09:52.759 --> 00:09:59.940
Greetings, my lord.

178
00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:08.980
Sir, say, what are you doing here?

179
00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:17.870
So, you're Jamie.

180
00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:19.220
Not bad.

181
00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:20.220
You are a tin.

182
00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:23.700
And I hear you're the captain of the Golden Core.

183
00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:25.379
That's right.

184
00:10:25.379 --> 00:10:29.590
Or you're a perfect match for my daughter.

185
00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:31.980
She does have a good honor.

186
00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:32.980
Forget it.

187
00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:34.980
I'm not marrying your daughter.

188
00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:36.980
I already have a wife.

189
00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:40.250
And I love her.

190
00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:41.250
What'd you say?

191
00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:44.169
Dude, Targaryen.

192
00:10:44.169 --> 00:10:45.169
Look at me.

193
00:10:45.169 --> 00:10:46.169
I'm Viserys.

194
00:10:46.169 --> 00:10:51.509
I'm head over heels alone with your daughter.

195
00:10:51.509 --> 00:10:57.799
We're a perfect match.

196
00:10:57.799 --> 00:11:04.289
Someone send this scum to the North Pole.

197
00:11:04.289 --> 00:11:07.289
Someone send this scum off to the North Pole.

198
00:11:07.289 --> 00:11:12.779
Get back up.

199
00:11:12.779 --> 00:11:13.779
What are you doing?

200
00:11:13.779 --> 00:11:18.580
Lady Targaryen?

201
00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:21.320
No, I stole my kidney.

202
00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:23.320
You gave me that bag after everything we'd been through.

203
00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:24.320
You can't do this thing.

204
00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:29.529
No, I don't even know what you're talking about.

205
00:11:29.529 --> 00:11:30.529
Get lost.

206
00:11:30.529 --> 00:11:35.509
I knew you were crazy.

207
00:11:35.509 --> 00:11:38.509
Luckily, this bomb is fake.

208
00:11:38.509 --> 00:11:42.049
Or else you'd have gotten me killed.

209
00:11:42.049 --> 00:11:44.049
Sir, please get rid of him.

210
00:11:44.049 --> 00:11:46.049
Please, and I'll leave too.

211
00:11:46.049 --> 00:11:54.230
Lady Targaryen, you want to marry our captain.

212
00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:55.230
Right?

213
00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:58.230
So why are you leaving when Dr. Targaryen gets here?

214
00:11:58.230 --> 00:11:59.230
You can marry our captain.

215
00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:00.230
Right here.

216
00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:01.230
Right now.

217
00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:03.230
Varys, I've had enough of you.

218
00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:05.230
Off to the North Pole.

219
00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:06.230
The captain.

220
00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:07.649
Hold up.

221
00:12:07.649 --> 00:12:09.649
So they are mistaken.

222
00:12:09.649 --> 00:12:10.970
A little brat.

223
00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:12.970
Let me test you.

224
00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:19.179
So, somebody has been bullying my daughter behind my back.

225
00:12:19.179 --> 00:12:23.460
And Jamie, you don't like my daughter.

226
00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:26.740
Do Targaryen.

227
00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:27.740
I'll do respect.

228
00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:32.029
I'm not going to betray my wife just to marry your daughter.

229
00:12:32.029 --> 00:12:34.029
If you're offended, I understand.

230
00:12:34.029 --> 00:12:37.029
The Golden Core and I will accept the consequences.

231
00:12:37.029 --> 00:12:49.269
You've caused teasing him.

232
00:12:49.269 --> 00:13:03.029
Jamie, let me introduce you to your father-in-law.

233
00:13:03.029 --> 00:13:04.029
Duke Targaryen.

234
00:13:04.029 --> 00:13:05.029
Yes.

235
00:13:05.029 --> 00:13:07.029
That Targaryen family.

236
00:13:07.029 --> 00:13:09.990
So you're a Targaryen?

237
00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:13.370
I only told you like a million.

238
00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:19.330
You can't believe.

239
00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:22.019
Just enough.

240
00:13:22.019 --> 00:13:24.500
Oh god.

241
00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:26.500
Jamie, my son-in-law.

242
00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:30.389
It looks like you really love Varyen.

243
00:13:30.389 --> 00:13:33.710
And it makes me feel good that you'll be by her side.

244
00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:39.809
I'll always be by her side.

245
00:13:39.809 --> 00:13:40.940
And you.

246
00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:43.940
I graciously chose to sponsor you.

247
00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:45.940
Yet you posed as my daughter.

248
00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:46.940
I can't believe it.

249
00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:49.940
Duke Targaryen, please, please spare me.

250
00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:50.940
I won't have to.

251
00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:51.940
Heaven.

252
00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:53.639
No.

253
00:13:53.639 --> 00:13:55.220
It's too late.

254
00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:58.179
How do you choose to punish her?

255
00:13:58.179 --> 00:13:59.269
Baby girl.

256
00:13:59.269 --> 00:14:17.370
She should be sent to the North Pole.

257
00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:21.789
For ten years.

258
00:14:21.789 --> 00:14:24.169
This is my lady.

259
00:14:24.169 --> 00:14:32.639
Duke Targaryen, please, please, please.

260
00:14:32.639 --> 00:14:34.639
You can't send me back to the North Pole.

261
00:14:34.639 --> 00:14:35.639
I was there before.

262
00:14:35.639 --> 00:14:36.639
I was drowned.

263
00:14:36.639 --> 00:14:37.639
Didn't have any money.

264
00:14:37.639 --> 00:14:38.639
I didn't know what to do with myself.

265
00:14:38.639 --> 00:14:41.049
No worries.

266
00:14:41.049 --> 00:14:42.049
Dad, I'll deal with it.

267
00:14:42.049 --> 00:14:50.629
You don't want to go back to the North Pole?

268
00:14:50.629 --> 00:14:51.629
Let's just start.

269
00:14:51.629 --> 00:14:52.629
Please.

270
00:14:52.629 --> 00:14:53.629
I'm so sorry.

271
00:14:53.629 --> 00:14:54.629
Just spare me.

272
00:14:54.629 --> 00:14:55.629
Brand.

273
00:14:55.629 --> 00:14:56.629
Throw him in a volcano.

274
00:14:56.629 --> 00:14:57.629
Yes, sir.

275
00:14:57.629 --> 00:14:59.879
There's no fucking way.

276
00:14:59.879 --> 00:15:01.039
I've got that fucking North Pole.

277
00:15:01.039 --> 00:15:02.039
Captain.

278
00:15:02.039 --> 00:15:03.039
My apologies.

279
00:15:03.039 --> 00:15:05.259
I was blind.

280
00:15:05.259 --> 00:15:08.259
And I tarnished the lady's name.

281
00:15:08.259 --> 00:15:17.649
I'll send myself to the North Pole.

282
00:15:17.649 --> 00:15:20.649
And make sure the Golden Corps thrives there.

283
00:15:20.649 --> 00:15:22.649
And I won't come back.

284
00:15:22.649 --> 00:15:23.649
One of this.

285
00:15:23.649 --> 00:15:24.649
You allow me?

286
00:15:24.649 --> 00:15:25.649
Good.

287
00:15:25.649 --> 00:15:26.649
Go now.

288
00:15:26.649 --> 00:15:27.649
Where were we?

289
00:15:27.649 --> 00:15:28.779
Brand.

290
00:15:28.779 --> 00:15:29.779
Targaryen.

291
00:15:29.779 --> 00:15:42.549
Do you take Jaime Stark as your lawfully wedded husband to be in love with him for the rest of your life?

292
00:15:42.549 --> 00:15:47.330
I do.

293
00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:48.330
Jaime Stark.

294
00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:49.330
Do you take Brand.

295
00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:50.330
I do.

296
00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:52.330
You may kiss her bride.
