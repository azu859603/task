1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,320
Who are you?

2
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:03,080
Should I tell her who I really am?

3
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:05,280
No, I can't reveal my true identity.

4
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,080
Home I ring the system.

5
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,080
For however long I've known I ring, she's always spoken about you very highly.

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:16,079
I ring and I've been through a lot over the years and I know that it would mean a lot to her for you to be there when she wakes up.

7
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:23,079
I can't let those who hurt her get away with this and take the company that she's worked so hard for.

8
00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:24,079
What are you gonna do?

9
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:30,339
Look at me. I look just like my sister, don't I?

10
00:00:30,339 --> 00:00:33,340
Pretty untrained are you? Yes.

11
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:35,729
I'm gonna pretend to be her.

12
00:00:35,729 --> 00:00:37,729
I'm gonna take back her company.

13
00:00:37,729 --> 00:00:39,789
Look at those assholes.

14
00:00:40,789 --> 00:00:43,140
What like her are you?

15
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,500
She's pretty classy. She grew up in London.

16
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,500
I grew up poor on the Upper East Side.

17
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,140
But uh...

18
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:54,140
You can teach me how to be like her, right?

19
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:55,140
Yes.

20
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,840
I can teach you.

21
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,840
One more condition.

22
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:04,019
Don't want me to just be my assistant.

23
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:14,939
I need you to be my knight, my puppy, great lover.

24
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:26,819
Irene, my dearest wife.

25
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:30,719
You were taken far too soon.

26
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:33,420
Rest in peace, bestie.

27
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,099
You'll always change.

28
00:01:36,099 --> 00:01:37,099
I should place my car.

29
00:01:37,099 --> 00:01:41,439
Ladies and gentlemen, Irene is gone.

30
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,439
And as you can see, I'm more grace-trick than anyone.

31
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:46,439
But Admiral Group can't be left unhandled.

32
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,439
So I've decided to take over.

33
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:52,209
I've decided to rename the company.

34
00:01:52,209 --> 00:01:56,939
From Admiral to the Lion Group.

35
00:01:56,939 --> 00:01:59,219
But Miss Irene isn't dead.

36
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:02,120
She's at the office.

37
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:06,200
That's impossible.
