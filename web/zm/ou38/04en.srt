1
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:06,469
There. And then what I'll tell you about being British.

2
00:00:06,469 --> 00:00:08,470
Yeah, yeah, I've got it. Got it.

3
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:10,630
A bottle of water and a cup of tea, please.

4
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:11,630
Be careful.

5
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:14,699
It's Miss Irene. She's been missing for almost a month.

6
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:16,699
We thought she was dead.

7
00:00:16,699 --> 00:00:18,699
Mr. Gwen will be so happy.

8
00:00:18,699 --> 00:00:20,699
He loved her so much.

9
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:24,870
Gwen loved my sister?

10
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:25,870
Yeah.

11
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:28,870
Since Wendy's pushing someone off a balcony count as a love.

12
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:30,870
Gwen is good at pretending.

13
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,869
To the public, he's a prominent business member.

14
00:00:32,869 --> 00:00:34,000
A loving husband.

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
He's more evil than I thought.

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,859
We have to be careful, Mary.

17
00:00:38,859 --> 00:00:40,859
Is it he gets the chance he could expose us?

18
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:44,859
Trust me. I'll make sure that Gwen and Jane are paid for their sins.

19
00:00:44,859 --> 00:01:12,819
If you're afraid, just don't calm Mary, okay?

20
00:01:12,819 --> 00:01:20,430
The Irene, I'm always going to break into the CEO's office.

21
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:26,579
If they do, I'll just say I have some assistance who seduced me.
