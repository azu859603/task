1
00:00:01,459 --> 00:00:03,549
You.

2
00:00:03,549 --> 00:00:05,070
You're not having me.

3
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:06,349
Who are you?

4
00:00:06,349 --> 00:00:08,419
My dear bestie, Jada.

5
00:00:08,419 --> 00:00:10,980
Irene has been missing for a month,

6
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,900
vanished without a trace.

7
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,179
You're just a fake.

8
00:00:14,179 --> 00:00:15,779
Brought him by him.

9
00:00:15,779 --> 00:00:17,699
She's a fake?

10
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:20,739
This woman has plotted with Irene's assistant.

11
00:00:20,739 --> 00:00:22,739
He had her undergo surgery.

12
00:00:22,739 --> 00:00:24,179
She make her look like Irene.

13
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:25,300
Despicable?

14
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,260
Maybe they even killed her.

15
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,780
Jada's Irene's best friend.

16
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,300
She must be telling you truth.

17
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,929
But how did she know that she was killed?

18
00:00:34,929 --> 00:00:39,100
Only someone as smart as me could see through this woman's disguise.

19
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,100
Speechless, are we?

20
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:41,979
Throw them out.

21
00:00:41,979 --> 00:00:43,820
I don't want them tarnishing Ireland's company.

22
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,259
Don't you dare.

23
00:00:45,259 --> 00:00:46,939
Into a lap-dong.

24
00:00:46,939 --> 00:00:49,579
Please, to be perfectly cling to Irene.

25
00:00:49,579 --> 00:00:51,179
Is your master gone?

26
00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:52,700
What day you step foot in here?

27
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,060
What proof do you have?

28
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:56,619
Poor, doggies.

29
00:00:56,619 --> 00:00:58,899
You're quite handsome, closer.

30
00:00:58,899 --> 00:01:00,899
When it's served me instead,

31
00:01:00,979 --> 00:01:02,740
I'll make you a good little boy.

32
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:05,170
My head.

33
00:01:06,049 --> 00:01:07,890
On my head it hurts.

34
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,450
I think I've done something about a rooftop.

35
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:12,290
Go to hell, you foolish woman!

36
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:13,859
No!

37
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:16,260
Yes, it was very cold and windy.

38
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,859
What was your fault?

39
00:01:17,859 --> 00:01:19,379
What are you talking about?

40
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:20,900
What windy rooftops?
