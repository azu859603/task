1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,140
What windy rooftops?

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:04,139
You were with me, remember?

3
00:00:04,139 --> 00:00:06,139
It was very cold.

4
00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:08,140
And you bought me a birthday shawl.

5
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:10,140
You were quite broke.

6
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:13,140
So I looked like you my card.

7
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:17,010
Anything for my bestie, remember?

8
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:21,010
My gifts for your best friend with her card.

9
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:23,010
What a leech.

10
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:25,010
Don't shut it, you losers!

11
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:27,010
What's wrong with you spending a tiny bit of our money?

12
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:28,010
She was rich enough.

13
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:30,010
You lived in her house rent free.

14
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:32,009
She financed your movie career.

15
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:34,229
She bought your magazine covers.

16
00:00:34,229 --> 00:00:36,229
You're only famous because of Irene.

17
00:00:36,229 --> 00:00:38,229
And you fucked her husband.

18
00:00:38,229 --> 00:00:40,229
She's so ungrateful.

19
00:00:40,229 --> 00:00:42,229
Jada really is living off Irene.

20
00:00:42,229 --> 00:00:45,229
She practically begged me to take the house in money.

21
00:00:45,229 --> 00:00:47,229
What I brought to her life is worth much more than that.

22
00:00:47,229 --> 00:00:48,229
There's a de-list celebrity.

23
00:00:48,229 --> 00:00:50,229
What do you actually bring to the table?

24
00:00:50,229 --> 00:00:52,229
What does she bring to the table?

25
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:54,700
I mean...

26
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,700
Lithna, the Duke of Wood Street,

27
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,700
plans to invest in Admiral.

28
00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:59,990
For me.

29
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:00,990
Wrong.

30
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:04,310
The Duke of Wood Street's investment is actually named for me.

31
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:07,310
Specifically, isn't that right, Danny?
