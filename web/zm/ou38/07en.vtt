00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.179
And now, as I've returned, as the CEO of Admiral Entertainment,

2
00:00:04.179 --> 00:00:07.179
the Duke is aware, and we're set to collaborate.

3
00:00:07.179 --> 00:00:10.179
So, it's Miss Irene, who came to take place.

4
00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:12.179
I'm buying more admiral shows tonight.

5
00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.179
See you.

6
00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:15.179
I don't care about the Duke's approval.

7
00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.179
I'm not going to let you win this, Jader.

8
00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:22.129
God, she's in the way.

9
00:00:22.129 --> 00:00:24.129
Why is everyone so obsessed with the Duke?

10
00:00:24.129 --> 00:00:26.129
It's probably a condescending douchebag,

11
00:00:26.129 --> 00:00:28.129
too afraid to show himself in public.

12
00:00:28.129 --> 00:00:31.129
You know, we know all the nobles are condescending douchebags.

13
00:00:31.129 --> 00:00:35.189
I wouldn't take a hundred dukes in the place

14
00:00:35.189 --> 00:00:37.189
but for my one handsome assistant.

15
00:00:37.189 --> 00:00:40.740
Oh, my way, I really love!

16
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.369
Oh, thank the Lord, you're OK.

17
00:00:44.369 --> 00:00:46.369
Oh.

18
00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:49.560
Darling, to celebrate this wonderful news,

19
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.560
I book the most luxurious sweet and dinner.

20
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.560
Spend the evening together.

21
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:55.560
How romantic.

22
00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.560
What a thoughtful husband.

23
00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.229
Darling, say something. You're too happy.

24
00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:04.230
Take back with me, your wonderful husband.

25
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:11.959
No, no, no, you think you are. This isn't funny.

26
00:01:11.959 --> 00:01:16.079
The real Irene will refuse my invitation.

27
00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:18.079
Oh, you want everyone to stop doubting?
