1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:03,620
One password, access denied.

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:08,339
I told her she wasn't tiring.

3
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:10,339
Now get this impostor out of here!

4
00:00:10,339 --> 00:00:13,339
You want me ready for a trip to hell with me, my Cerberus?

5
00:00:13,339 --> 00:00:16,440
You really like comparing these dogs, don't you?

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,440
It's because you're my puppy.

7
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,440
And I'm joking. Do you really think you can put the correct password in?

8
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,690
My finger slipped.

9
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:28,690
Press the wrong key accidentally, but it's fine.

10
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:31,690
There's one chance before you count marks.

11
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:33,689
What if she gets it right this time?

12
00:00:33,689 --> 00:00:34,689
Don't give her a second chance.

13
00:00:34,689 --> 00:00:36,689
Dad's trying hard your job.

14
00:00:36,689 --> 00:00:39,039
The impostor just assaulted me.

15
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:45,039
I was trying to catch you, but it's very hard to grab such a slippery bitch.

16
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,359
Darling, you still have shares in the company, don't you?

17
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:52,640
And you?

18
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,640
You got very used to using me for my money.

19
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,640
So what?

20
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,960
Well, I shouldn't let our shareholders be the ones risking everything, should we?
