1
00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.669
We shouldn't let our shareholders be the ones risking everything, should we?

2
00:00:06.669 --> 00:00:14.470
Could it be that Gwen and Irene are teaming up together to swindle us out of our own shares?

3
00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:23.000
Jumping imposter, get out of here!

4
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.570
Are you crazy?

5
00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.359
I don't think she likes you.

6
00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.879
Are you trying to get rid of me because you know I'm the real Irene?

7
00:00:30.879 --> 00:00:33.880
The real Irene wouldn't have got the password incorrect.

8
00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.479
You're just making excuses.

9
00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:38.679
Oh, if you're so sure, why don't we raise the stakes?

10
00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:39.679
Look ahead.

11
00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:40.679
I'm scared?

12
00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:48.280
If I enter the password correctly, you have to wear a specially designed costume that says

13
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.679
Friend Beaching Beach and Pose for the Media.

14
00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:54.679
I'm sure I can get you the headline as the CEO of Admiral.

15
00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:59.679
If I enter it incorrectly, then I'll pose a nude for the media.

16
00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:02.679
How about that? Or is the big star too scared to take you to the bed?

17
00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:03.679
Hi.

18
00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:05.840
Now you're lying.

19
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.840
Gwen doesn't have a password.

20
00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.840
I don't.

21
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.840
If I fail, you still stand by me.

22
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.569
Let me say I was your surplus.

23
00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:22.560
Irene, you'll watch over me and Daniel, right?

24
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:42.700
It was Mom's first. I got it right.

25
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.700
How is that possible?

26
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.930
So, uh, ladies and gentlemen, as per our bet, one of your shares in mine.

27
00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:51.930
Thank you.

28
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.930
As the majority shareholder of Admiral, I'm now in full control of the company.

29
00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:02.159
Who teamed up with her to swindle us out of our shares, didn't you?

30
00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.159
No.

31
00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:04.159
It was your plan all over.

32
00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:05.159
No, it wasn't.

33
00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.159
Don't come up to me. Go up to them.

34
00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:07.159
No, no.

35
00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:08.159
Don't have money, Robbie.

36
00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:09.159
I know.

37
00:02:09.159 --> 00:02:10.159
I know you.

38
00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:11.159
Tell them I can't.

39
00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:12.479
Aren't you happy, darling?

40
00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:15.479
You've become what he's ours now and what mine is yours, right?

41
00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:32.060
This woman to prove that she's not the real Irene.

42
00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.870
No, no, no, no.

43
00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.900
How do you see her as an integrity?

44
00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.289
Guys, I can see.

45
00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:40.289
Miles, please.

46
00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:45.389
Nothing to say now, do you?

47
00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:47.620
It's just a DNA report.

48
00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.620
Hey, we can all get lucky guessing passwords, but DNA doesn't lie.

49
00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:52.620
Exactly.

50
00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.620
The DNA report will prove that I am the real Irene.

51
00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:57.650
Oh, just give up.

52
00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:58.650
I secretly took your hair.

53
00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.650
You had no time to switch the samples.

54
00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.650
I would advise not to open that.

55
00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.780
You're only going to embarrass yourself.

56
00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:05.780
See, shall we?

57
00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.780
I don't care who you are and over my assets.

58
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:08.780
Who am I?

59
00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.780
I'm your wife, the CEO of Admiral Entertainment.

60
00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:13.780
I'm Irene.

61
00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.780
Well, don't blame me when you hit rock bottom.

62
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:17.780
You're committed to serious fraud.

63
00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:18.780
Let's make no mistake.

64
00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:24.879
But I'll make sure you've been up in the worst prison in ever.

65
00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:25.879
Shall we have a look?

66
00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:28.870
It says here, the DNA match.

67
00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:29.870
It's 99%.

68
00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.099
Ms. Jada, I think you've made a mistake.

69
00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:35.099
Exactly what you're trying to prove.

70
00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:37.129
How is this possible?

71
00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:40.129
As you say you were a hundred percent sure last night.

72
00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:41.129
I never failed my operations.

73
00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:43.129
My strategies were all I know.

74
00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:44.129
Whatever you mean, I made a mistake.

75
00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:45.129
Something to it wrong.

76
00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:46.129
This can't be wrong.

77
00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:47.129
This can't be wrong.

78
00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:49.159
Enough of this nonsense!

79
00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:58.000
Keep shooting.

80
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Take more pictures.

81
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Capture the elegance of the upper class.

82
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:21.660
You are!

83
00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.660
No, if it's a good idea to go follow Gwen's plans alone.

84
00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.139
But I need to see what he's up to.

85
00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:42.189
What if Gwen sees you?

86
00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:45.379
Someone seems to be playing the role of Gwen's wife a little too well.

87
00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:46.379
Oh.

88
00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:48.379
Here's my puppy getting jealous already.

89
00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:50.699
You have nothing to worry about.

90
00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:53.790
Gwen is dangerous.

91
00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:55.180
I'd like you to worry.

92
00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.180
Does he really care about me?

93
00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.180
Or am I just a replacement for Irene?

94
00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.180
Quick!

95
00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:01.180
Quick!

96
00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:09.699
Hide.

97
00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:16.490
Fuck are you?

98
00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:17.490
Fuck are you?

99
00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:22.430
There's no way you're Irene.

100
00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:23.430
I'm Irene Gwen.

101
00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:24.430
I'm your wife.

102
00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.040
You wanna be Irene?

103
00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:29.600
Fine.

104
00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.600
Maybe you two fuck the same.

105
00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.889
Do you want me to show you a favorite position?

106
00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:34.889
Just to get you started?

107
00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:35.889
Get off me.

108
00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:38.209
You fucking reek.

109
00:05:38.209 --> 00:05:40.720
I'm not sleeping with a two-pump chump.

110
00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:41.720
Fucking bitch!

111
00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.720
No, whoever you want, you're really starting to press me up!

112
00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:45.720
Honey!

113
00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:46.720
You're hurting me.

114
00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.040
You've drunk too much wine.

115
00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.040
You need to sober up.

116
00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.170
Why?

117
00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:52.579
Great idea.

118
00:05:52.579 --> 00:05:56.949
The anti-classical 2016.

119
00:05:56.949 --> 00:06:08.110
You're great, you know what I'm saying.

120
00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:09.110
You see Irene?

121
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.819
This is all because of you.

122
00:06:11.819 --> 00:06:15.870
Ever since I threw you off that balcony, I felt so good!

123
00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:23.279
What are you implying?

124
00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:24.279
What am I implying?

125
00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:27.949
Well, I am a man.

126
00:06:27.949 --> 00:06:28.949
And you are the CEO.

127
00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:31.949
You have no idea how difficult it was coming into that workplace.

128
00:06:31.949 --> 00:06:33.949
Having you as the superior of life.

129
00:06:33.949 --> 00:06:36.139
Did I report it into?

130
00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:38.139
I built that company from the ground up.

131
00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:42.199
Where were you when I was working 80 hour weeks?

132
00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:44.199
You're so entitled.

133
00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:45.199
It's disgusting.

134
00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:46.199
Shut up!

135
00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:47.360
You're my wife!

136
00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.360
And you belong to me.

137
00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.360
And so does the company.

138
00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:51.360
Yeah?

139
00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.360
You're a psychopath.

140
00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.389
And just remember, you do, I mean, you do have one advantage.

141
00:06:56.389 --> 00:06:58.389
And that's right between your legs.

142
00:06:58.389 --> 00:07:01.649
And just remember, every success that you've had,

143
00:07:01.649 --> 00:07:02.649
from when you decided to swim.

144
00:07:02.649 --> 00:07:03.649
Oh, shut up!

145
00:07:03.649 --> 00:07:04.649
You're disgusting!

146
00:07:04.649 --> 00:07:06.649
How would I even have a marry-all like you?

147
00:07:06.649 --> 00:07:07.649
I don't understand.

148
00:07:07.649 --> 00:07:09.649
You just want me to disappear, is that it?

149
00:07:09.649 --> 00:07:10.649
Um...

150
00:07:10.649 --> 00:07:12.029
Oh, my darling.

151
00:07:12.029 --> 00:07:13.029
What exactly?

152
00:07:13.029 --> 00:07:14.259
I...

153
00:07:14.259 --> 00:07:15.670
Shh.

154
00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:17.670
Firstly, I went my company back.

155
00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:20.470
And then you can fuck up back to where you came from.

156
00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:25.060
Piding something?

157
00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:40.139
Forgotten what?

158
00:07:40.139 --> 00:07:41.139
Fucking thing.

159
00:07:41.139 --> 00:07:45.290
Even if you do remember, once I get rid of you,

160
00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:47.290
you'll remember nothing at all, will you?

161
00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:48.480
A two-part.

162
00:07:48.480 --> 00:08:08.850
Is that all this is?

163
00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:12.879
Are you just protecting me to make yourself feel better about what happened to my sister?

164
00:08:12.879 --> 00:08:17.879
It's over, Mary.

165
00:08:17.879 --> 00:08:19.879
I'm not gonna let him hurt you like you did to worry.

166
00:08:19.879 --> 00:08:21.879
Yeah, but if I wasn't playing Irene,

167
00:08:21.879 --> 00:08:23.879
would you still have saved me?

168
00:08:23.879 --> 00:08:27.860
Am I crying?

169
00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:30.860
Daniel, I thought you and I were just a game,

170
00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:33.860
but am I really starting to fall in love with you?

171
00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:41.669
I'll tell you this.

172
00:08:41.669 --> 00:08:42.740
I'll be back.

173
00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:47.419
I'll continue being Mary's assistant.

174
00:08:47.419 --> 00:08:52.649
The Wardsbury family expects you to formally take over as the CEO of the Family Corporation.

175
00:08:52.649 --> 00:08:53.649
And I far refuse.

176
00:08:53.649 --> 00:08:55.649
Let never refuse to recognize you as the Duke of Woodbury.

177
00:08:55.649 --> 00:08:56.649
Even if I'm not the Duke,

178
00:08:56.649 --> 00:08:58.649
I can still reclaim the company back for Irene.

179
00:08:58.649 --> 00:09:00.649
And St. Gwen and Jade are to hell.

180
00:09:00.649 --> 00:09:02.649
But sir, you need to consider Miss Mary.

181
00:09:02.649 --> 00:09:05.649
The Elders won't allow a woman to hold you back.

182
00:09:05.649 --> 00:09:08.740
If they decide to, eliminate her.

183
00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:10.740
If I don't return, Mary could really be in danger.

184
00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:11.740
Fine.

185
00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:12.740
Tell them I'll come back.

186
00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:16.740
Forgive me, sir, but you've never gone to such lengths for Miss Irene before.

187
00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:18.740
Mary isn't Irene and she never will be.

188
00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:20.740
I will reclaim the company back for Irene.

189
00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:21.970
I would ever cost.

190
00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:23.970
He's just using me to help my sister.

191
00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:28.289
This ring represents the glory of my family and my feelings for you, Mary.

192
00:09:28.289 --> 00:09:31.320
Where this ring, no one can hurt you.

193
00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:34.049
Take this ring.

194
00:09:34.049 --> 00:09:35.139
What does this mean?

195
00:09:35.139 --> 00:09:37.399
That ring will protect you.

196
00:09:37.399 --> 00:09:39.399
Are you leaving me, Daniel?

197
00:09:39.399 --> 00:09:42.399
I have some matters to handle, so I can't be your sister anymore.

198
00:09:42.399 --> 00:09:45.620
Because you only want to be Irene's assistant, right?

199
00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:46.620
I heard it all.

200
00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:49.620
To reclaim the company for Irene at any cost.

201
00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:51.620
Just a pawn to you, aren't I?

202
00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:53.620
You don't care about me at all.

203
00:09:53.620 --> 00:10:02.220
I know who you really want to give the ring to.

204
00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:05.220
Yeah, you want to give the ring to my sister Irene, right?

205
00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:06.220
No, Mary.

206
00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:08.220
She's the one you truly love.

207
00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:10.279
I'm just like a shadow.

208
00:10:10.279 --> 00:10:11.279
No, Mary.

209
00:10:11.279 --> 00:10:12.279
You are no one's shadow.

210
00:10:12.279 --> 00:10:13.279
You are unique.

211
00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:15.309
I care about you so much.

212
00:10:15.309 --> 00:10:17.309
Oh, yeah, tell me why you're leaving then.

213
00:10:17.309 --> 00:10:19.309
I can't explain right now.

214
00:10:19.309 --> 00:10:20.309
At the moment, I can.

215
00:10:20.309 --> 00:10:23.019
I promise you, I will tell you everything.

216
00:10:23.019 --> 00:10:25.019
Yeah, I thought we were in this together.

217
00:10:25.019 --> 00:10:26.019
Tell me now.

218
00:10:26.019 --> 00:10:29.080
I thought we were a team, but now you're hiding things from me.

219
00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:32.490
You really don't care about me at all.

220
00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:33.490
No, it's not true.

221
00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:37.019
Get out.

222
00:10:37.019 --> 00:10:39.019
Our relationship was just a game and I don't want to play with you.

223
00:10:39.019 --> 00:10:41.019
It's just a game and I don't want to play anymore.

224
00:10:41.019 --> 00:11:13.629
Okay, just leave.

225
00:11:13.629 --> 00:11:15.629
What are you doing, you silly cow?

226
00:11:15.629 --> 00:11:16.629
Stop drinking.

227
00:11:16.629 --> 00:11:18.940
We'll give it back.

228
00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:23.440
No, no, no, you fell in love.

229
00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:26.600
Bitch, I'm struggling by chances of stardom.

230
00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:28.600
The whole world thinks I'm a chute.

231
00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:30.600
What do you not understand though about a fake DNA test?

232
00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:32.730
You had one job.

233
00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:34.730
You screwed us both out of the company.

234
00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:35.730
Don't blame me.

235
00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:37.820
You're no better.

236
00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:39.820
Irene's man, slave.

237
00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:42.889
Coming from you, fucking bestie leech.

238
00:11:42.889 --> 00:11:45.889
Slave and a leech make quite the pair, huh?

239
00:11:45.889 --> 00:11:47.340
Shut up.

240
00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:51.509
Those are supporting your family.

241
00:11:51.509 --> 00:11:54.509
You'll lose a gambling father would have sold you off a long time again.

242
00:11:54.509 --> 00:11:57.509
She mentioned that best it's new.

243
00:11:57.509 --> 00:12:03.000
Is that all you've got?

244
00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
You ought to start behaving yourself madam.

245
00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.370
You'll be out on the streets where you belong.

246
00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:12.679
And why?

247
00:12:12.679 --> 00:12:14.679
Irene's man, just remember.

248
00:12:14.679 --> 00:12:56.259
Was that your plan?

249
00:12:56.259 --> 00:12:59.259
Invite me into a members club that you thought I wouldn't get into.

250
00:12:59.259 --> 00:13:00.259
Pathetic.

251
00:13:00.259 --> 00:13:02.289
Darling, it's really so nice that you did it.

252
00:13:02.289 --> 00:13:06.289
Honey, aren't you so sweet to Jada always?

253
00:13:06.289 --> 00:13:09.120
Did you just have a chat, shall we?

254
00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:11.120
I want some wine as well.

255
00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:13.120
Let's cut the small talk and settle the bet.

256
00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:16.980
I feel bad headache.

257
00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:18.980
I feel a little bit sick.

258
00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:20.980
I don't think I could fulfill the terms of the bet.

259
00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:25.990
Have you got me all dressed up for this bullshit?

260
00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:28.990
If you want out of the bet, you can always beg me.

261
00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:32.379
There's no need for the dramatics.

262
00:13:32.379 --> 00:13:37.919
Jada's clearly sick.

263
00:13:37.919 --> 00:13:39.919
Let's just be nice, shall we?

264
00:13:39.919 --> 00:13:40.919
Let's enjoy the moment.

265
00:13:40.919 --> 00:13:42.919
Why are you always defending her, darling?

266
00:13:42.919 --> 00:13:45.919
Have you forgotten which one of us you're actually married to?

267
00:13:45.919 --> 00:13:48.139
How about a toast?

268
00:13:48.139 --> 00:13:50.340
I feel a return, darling.

269
00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:52.870
Sure.

270
00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:53.870
Okay, it's short.

271
00:13:53.870 --> 00:14:12.379
It's my return.

272
00:14:12.379 --> 00:14:13.379
You're not Irene.

273
00:14:13.379 --> 00:14:15.379
The real Irene is allergic to red wine.

274
00:14:15.379 --> 00:14:18.379
This woman is an imposter trying to steal admiral.

275
00:14:18.379 --> 00:14:20.379
How evil?

276
00:14:20.379 --> 00:14:22.379
Pretending to be Irene and playing with my heart.

277
00:14:22.379 --> 00:14:29.220
So easily they used stupid fruit.

278
00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:31.500
Now I've got everything.

279
00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:36.320
You know, he was spending the rest of your life in prison.

280
00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:38.320
Reporter? Reporters? Where are the reporters?

281
00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:42.570
Who ever you are, hand over admiral?

282
00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:46.690
Or we'll share this information to everyone.

283
00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:48.690
You spend the rest of your life in prison.

284
00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:55.149
And before getting into prison, you better remember to fill the terms of the bet.

285
00:14:55.149 --> 00:14:56.149
Eatly nude.

286
00:14:56.149 --> 00:14:58.149
You become prison's biggest star.

287
00:14:58.149 --> 00:15:00.149
My prison's biggest porn star.

288
00:15:02.149 --> 00:15:05.149
Once you're naked, somewhere with your tycoon, Mike, I'm calling.

289
00:15:05.149 --> 00:15:08.820
And you'll finally be able to be rich thing.

290
00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:10.370
Who's that so?

291
00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:11.370
Oh no.

292
00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:13.429
I forgot about the allergy.

293
00:15:13.429 --> 00:15:15.429
I need to find a way out.

294
00:15:15.429 --> 00:15:18.139
She got nothing to say.

295
00:15:18.139 --> 00:15:21.870
Darling, you're so forgetful.

296
00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:24.129
Don't you remember?

297
00:15:24.129 --> 00:15:27.610
I treated my allergy months ago.

298
00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:29.740
You're talking about not possible.

299
00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:31.740
You were with me at the hospital.

300
00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:32.740
What do you people believe?

301
00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:35.740
Us, Irene's husband and best friend.

302
00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:36.740
Are you?

303
00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:38.740
You're no bitch.

304
00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:40.740
I want this video everywhere.

305
00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:43.740
I want everyone to see what a fraud she is.

306
00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:44.740
OK?

307
00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:45.740
Yeah, yes, sir.

308
00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:46.740
But, erm...

309
00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:48.740
See, you've got the restaurants and networks down the video.

310
00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:49.740
Then we'll upload.

311
00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:50.740
What?

312
00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:55.970
Are you the Jika Woods?

313
00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:56.970
Eat you baboon!

314
00:15:56.970 --> 00:16:00.500
Do something!

315
00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:01.500
Get me that!

316
00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:04.320
It's a prettiest book.

317
00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:05.320
Who helped me?

318
00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:06.320
Could it be Daniel?

319
00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:07.379
This was you, isn't it, Daniel?

320
00:16:07.379 --> 00:16:08.379
This was you.

321
00:16:08.379 --> 00:16:11.379
I've been sat here the whole time, you idiot.

322
00:16:11.379 --> 00:16:12.379
How could I've turned off a signal?

323
00:16:12.379 --> 00:16:15.379
You're worried that we're going to expose you, aren't you?

324
00:16:15.379 --> 00:16:16.379
She's nervous.

325
00:16:16.379 --> 00:16:18.379
I saw the reporters when I walked in.

326
00:16:18.379 --> 00:16:20.379
You know, scheming's got to be a little worse.

327
00:16:20.379 --> 00:16:22.379
Looks like Jada's acting.

328
00:16:22.379 --> 00:16:25.379
Oh, clearly those lessons aren't paying off.

329
00:16:25.379 --> 00:16:26.379
Shh!

330
00:16:26.379 --> 00:16:28.090
Not your tip!

331
00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:29.090
Jada, calm down!

332
00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:30.090
Bill!

333
00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:31.090
It's OK, Jada!

334
00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:32.090
Oh, hell of this!

335
00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:34.090
It's big talk there for a liar, isn't it?

336
00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:35.090
Huh?

337
00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:37.090
If you hadn't drunk the rent wire and been so obvious,

338
00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:40.090
you would have fallen right into our damn trap, would you?

339
00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:42.090
That doesn't prove anything.

340
00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:44.090
You know, you don't scare me, you two,

341
00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:46.090
but you are quite entertaining.

342
00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:47.090
A lot of clowns.

343
00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:50.090
Drinking the red wine confirmed you're not angry at.

344
00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:52.090
Darling, what's wrong? Don't you believe me?

345
00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:54.090
God, the crap will you? I won't prove!

346
00:16:54.090 --> 00:16:56.090
She came down and she has no proof.

347
00:16:56.090 --> 00:16:58.090
All right, let's just drink it out.

348
00:16:58.090 --> 00:17:00.379
He who asserts must provide proof.

349
00:17:00.379 --> 00:17:03.379
You know, this hasn't been a very promising lunch.

350
00:17:03.379 --> 00:17:06.380
And I'd rather lost my opportunity to give back.

351
00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:07.380
You get here?

352
00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:21.470
Goodie, it's you.

353
00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:24.269
She's showing up at the right moment, aren't you?

354
00:17:24.269 --> 00:17:26.269
Someone's going to save the day from your muppets.

355
00:17:26.269 --> 00:17:29.269
Throwing wine bottles and pulling out of the bet.

356
00:17:29.269 --> 00:17:31.269
What will the public think when this gets out?

357
00:17:31.269 --> 00:17:33.269
You filthy bitch!

358
00:17:33.269 --> 00:17:37.269
Stop stalling! Okay, we still haven't had proof that you're not angry at all.

359
00:17:37.269 --> 00:17:38.269
Says who?

360
00:17:38.269 --> 00:17:41.039
Irene Chirder, allergies months ago.

361
00:17:41.039 --> 00:17:42.039
Possible!

362
00:17:42.039 --> 00:17:43.039
There you go.

363
00:17:43.039 --> 00:17:44.039
There's further proof.

364
00:17:44.039 --> 00:17:47.039
So, no nudes and certainly no shares for either of you.

365
00:17:47.039 --> 00:17:48.039
Must be a fake report.

366
00:17:48.039 --> 00:17:51.039
The only fake thing here is you two money grabbing morons.

367
00:17:51.039 --> 00:17:54.670
Lost, will you?

368
00:17:54.670 --> 00:17:57.670
You're really my goddamn oxygen, Darling!

369
00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:00.630
Oh, Jacob, what's free?

370
00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:04.930
What's free is that?

371
00:18:04.930 --> 00:18:05.930
Don't worry about that, let's go.

372
00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:06.930
Green!

373
00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:07.930
Just you wait.

374
00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:08.930
You're not going to wait that easily.

375
00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:13.519
I said we shouldn't meet again.

376
00:18:13.519 --> 00:18:15.519
Never even forget about that.

377
00:18:15.519 --> 00:18:16.519
I want to help you.

378
00:18:16.519 --> 00:18:17.519
Think it'll be for me.

379
00:18:17.519 --> 00:18:18.519
Where's your ring?

380
00:18:18.519 --> 00:18:21.700
We've given it to someone else.

381
00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:23.700
This is the Duke of what's free is free.

382
00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:26.829
It's allowed you to control all the resources in the city.

383
00:18:26.829 --> 00:18:27.829
Oh no.

384
00:18:27.829 --> 00:18:29.829
I hope Jayden didn't take it.

385
00:18:29.829 --> 00:18:30.829
No, I know.

386
00:18:30.829 --> 00:18:31.829
My sister gave you the ring.

387
00:18:31.829 --> 00:18:33.829
And that's why it's so important to you.

388
00:18:33.829 --> 00:18:35.900
My father actually gave it to me.

389
00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:36.900
Father are giving us thundering.

390
00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:37.900
What are you?

391
00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:38.900
Royalty?

392
00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:40.900
My dad's into family traditions.

393
00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:44.440
Mary, since I've been away, I've been secretly protecting you.

394
00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:47.630
After all, Gwen and Jayden are ruthless.

395
00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:49.759
I don't need your protection.

396
00:18:49.759 --> 00:18:54.099
I would never forgive myself if anything happened to you today.

397
00:18:54.099 --> 00:18:55.359
You know what?

398
00:18:55.359 --> 00:18:56.359
Defend myself just fine.

399
00:18:56.359 --> 00:18:57.359
And you know what else?

400
00:18:57.359 --> 00:18:58.650
Look at this.

401
00:18:58.650 --> 00:18:59.650
Yeah.

402
00:18:59.650 --> 00:19:01.640
I saw this.

403
00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:04.640
It's a photo of my sister on your phone.

404
00:19:05.769 --> 00:19:06.769
Yeah.

405
00:19:06.769 --> 00:19:08.769
If you don't feel guilty about me, feel guilty about her.

406
00:19:08.769 --> 00:19:09.859
Look at me.

407
00:19:09.859 --> 00:19:11.859
When you look at me in my eyes.

408
00:19:11.859 --> 00:19:13.279
Are you seeing Mary?

409
00:19:13.279 --> 00:19:15.279
Or are you seeing Irene?

410
00:19:15.279 --> 00:19:21.180
Are you laughing?

411
00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:23.809
Joke to you.

412
00:19:23.809 --> 00:19:24.809
Let me answer.

413
00:19:24.809 --> 00:19:25.809
You're in love with my sister.

414
00:19:25.809 --> 00:19:27.809
And I'm just some kind of...

415
00:19:27.809 --> 00:19:28.809
Stand in.

416
00:19:28.809 --> 00:19:30.809
Mary, you have got this all wrong.

417
00:19:30.809 --> 00:19:33.809
You've got a screensaver of my sister.

418
00:19:33.809 --> 00:19:34.869
And I've got it wrong.

419
00:19:34.869 --> 00:19:36.869
Mary, person to me, please.

420
00:19:36.869 --> 00:19:37.869
Can you just listen to me?

421
00:19:37.869 --> 00:19:38.869
Oh, yes.

422
00:19:38.869 --> 00:19:39.869
Can you just listen to me?

423
00:19:39.869 --> 00:19:41.940
My sister's room.

424
00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:43.940
And talk about your feelings for her.

425
00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:45.940
I'm nobody's substitute.

426
00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:47.940
You are no one's substitute.

427
00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:49.940
You are yourself unique and irreplaceable.

428
00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:50.940
So don't ever say that.

429
00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:51.940
Yeah.

430
00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:52.940
All right.

431
00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:53.940
Okay.

432
00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:54.940
Yeah.

433
00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:55.940
This is just some trick.

434
00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:56.940
But guess what?

435
00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:57.940
I'm not falling for it.

436
00:19:57.940 --> 00:19:58.940
Mary, my feelings for Irene are what you think.

437
00:19:58.940 --> 00:19:59.940
I just admire the way Irene.

438
00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:00.940
You admire her.

439
00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:02.940
You think about her when we're together.

440
00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:03.940
It's fucking sick actually.

441
00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:04.940
Mary, let me finish.

442
00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:05.940
Please.

443
00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:06.940
Just let me finish.

444
00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:09.440
Mary, please.

445
00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:10.440
Just let me finish.

446
00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:11.440
Don't.

447
00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:12.440
Just look.

448
00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:13.440
Look.

449
00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:14.440
Look closer.

450
00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:15.759
What?

451
00:20:15.759 --> 00:20:16.759
It's not Irene.

452
00:20:16.759 --> 00:20:17.759
It's you.

453
00:20:17.759 --> 00:20:19.140
I'm all in the air load.

454
00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:20.240
My favorite spot to kiss.

455
00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:21.240
Really some mold.

456
00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:25.960
What about you and my sister?

457
00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:27.960
My feelings for Irene are purely admiration.

458
00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:29.960
There has never been a replacement, Mary.

459
00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:37.430
I only love you.

460
00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:40.069
Then why did you laugh just now?

461
00:20:40.069 --> 00:20:42.069
I was happy to see you get so emotional for me.

462
00:20:42.069 --> 00:20:47.180
I didn't actually think I could make you that mad.

463
00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:55.380
I'm sorry.

464
00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:56.380
You said you loved me.

465
00:20:56.380 --> 00:21:00.299
It's a pretty serious word.

466
00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:03.500
My feelings for you are just a serious.

467
00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:06.009
Mary, you've got to trust me.

468
00:21:06.009 --> 00:21:09.700
My heart is only for you.

469
00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:10.740
Okay.

470
00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:14.309
From now on, you can't keep any secrets, okay?

471
00:21:14.309 --> 00:21:16.599
You can't keep anything from me.

472
00:21:16.599 --> 00:21:17.599
I promise.

473
00:21:17.599 --> 00:21:24.589
You promised to be my puppy.

474
00:21:24.589 --> 00:21:26.589
I didn't know you were going to act like one.

475
00:21:26.589 --> 00:21:30.480
I'm not just just a secret little puppy, remember?

476
00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:34.430
I'm your secret lover.

477
00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:51.019
Fucking up my plans.

478
00:21:51.019 --> 00:21:54.130
I don't know.

479
00:21:54.130 --> 00:21:55.130
I'm just still with this woman myself.

480
00:21:55.130 --> 00:22:01.319
You're home early, darling.

481
00:22:01.319 --> 00:22:03.420
Are you here with more evidence?

482
00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:05.420
To prove I'm an imposter?

483
00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:07.420
Don't you dare deceive me.

484
00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:10.250
Look, make it up too cold.

485
00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:11.250
Look, it's lunch tomorrow.

486
00:22:11.250 --> 00:22:18.440
I have an appointment at 12 noon tomorrow.

487
00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:21.599
Maybe you see her, keeps you very busy.

488
00:22:21.599 --> 00:22:25.460
If she wouldn't know anything about me, you see her.

489
00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:28.140
Darling, wait.

490
00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:30.170
I've got a surprise for you.

491
00:22:30.170 --> 00:22:31.170
Aren't you curious?

492
00:22:31.170 --> 00:22:33.460
I'll see if I can move my schedule around.

493
00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:34.460
How about that?

494
00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:35.460
Wonderful.

495
00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:37.460
I look forward to it.

496
00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:42.650
See if I can move me.

497
00:22:42.650 --> 00:22:50.730
Soon be mine.

498
00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:52.980
Just you wait.

499
00:22:52.980 --> 00:23:02.460
It's good.

500
00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:04.869
You look beautiful, come in.

501
00:23:04.869 --> 00:23:11.319
It's been so long since we've had lunch together.

502
00:23:11.319 --> 00:23:13.089
Here.

503
00:23:13.089 --> 00:23:16.500
I don't have time for Chit Chat.

504
00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:17.500
Can we get to the point?

505
00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:19.500
There's something I want to discuss with you as a couple, right?

506
00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:21.940
Not with the presence of an outsider.

507
00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:23.940
Will you get lost, boy?

508
00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:25.940
Daniel, take a seat.

509
00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:27.200
Thank you.

510
00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:28.200
I'm sorry.

511
00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:40.240
Picking's diabolical.

512
00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:42.240
Does everything you touch turn to shit?

513
00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:46.279
Bye.

514
00:23:46.279 --> 00:23:48.279
Maybe if you don't want any, your lap dog will.

515
00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:50.599
You hoo.

516
00:23:50.599 --> 00:23:51.599
Grow up, Gwen.

517
00:23:51.599 --> 00:23:53.599
Don't you bark when your master brings you food?

518
00:23:53.599 --> 00:23:54.599
Go on, bark!

519
00:23:54.599 --> 00:24:00.220
Don't you think you're being a bit rough with my guest?

520
00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:02.960
What are you calling me, guest?

521
00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:03.960
He's not a guest.

522
00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:04.960
He's an assistant, though.

523
00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:05.960
A shit muncher.

524
00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:09.299
Tracy?

525
00:24:09.299 --> 00:24:15.039
I paid for it.

526
00:24:15.039 --> 00:24:16.039
Yes, we did.

527
00:24:16.039 --> 00:24:17.039
Still!

528
00:24:17.039 --> 00:24:19.859
Wouldn't do that.

529
00:24:19.859 --> 00:24:21.539
Let him go.

530
00:24:21.539 --> 00:24:23.539
Let's see if he's got the balls to murder his wife.

531
00:24:23.539 --> 00:24:28.000
Darling, your expression's just now quite frightening.

532
00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.000
I remember seeing it somewhere on a rooftop.

533
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:38.480
I was on a rooftop.

534
00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:41.150
And someone tapped me on the shoulder.

535
00:24:41.150 --> 00:24:46.150
And I saw that ugly little expression before someone gave me a push.

536
00:24:46.150 --> 00:24:48.150
And I lay unconscious.

537
00:24:48.150 --> 00:24:49.980
You're crazy.

538
00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:51.980
That person knew, honey.

539
00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:52.980
Oh, darling.

540
00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:53.980
Oh, God.

541
00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:54.980
I love you.

542
00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:56.980
What are you saying?

543
00:24:56.980 --> 00:24:59.819
You love me so much.

544
00:24:59.819 --> 00:25:02.880
You wouldn't do anything like that.

545
00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:06.099
You won't get a penny from me, all my company.

546
00:25:06.099 --> 00:25:08.099
Come to hell, you foolish woman.

547
00:25:08.099 --> 00:25:09.099
Hurry!

548
00:25:09.099 --> 00:25:13.349
Must be my memory getting mixed up.

549
00:25:13.349 --> 00:25:14.349
Sorry.

550
00:25:14.349 --> 00:25:15.349
Maybe get some rest.

551
00:25:15.349 --> 00:25:16.349
I can't rest.

552
00:25:16.349 --> 00:25:18.480
Jade has been troubling me.

553
00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:21.470
When do you think I should release the videos, darling?

554
00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:24.470
I really want my bestie to make her splash.
