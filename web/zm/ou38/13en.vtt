00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:04.419
Is this your surprise?

2
00:00:04.419 --> 00:00:05.620
Boy, I warn you.

3
00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:06.629
Ha ha ha!

4
00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.109
Oh, Nick, I should be the one warning you!

5
00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:10.550
See, when this gets out...

6
00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:11.429
No, no, no.

7
00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.470
You won't just be a slut, will you?

8
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:15.029
You'll be a bankrupt slut!

9
00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:15.910
How much do you want?

10
00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:17.030
Money isn't an issue.

11
00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:18.949
Money? Isn't enough money!

12
00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:20.620
I thought control about it.

13
00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.140
Admiral Entertainment.

14
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.620
I should be the CEO, not you!

15
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.980
Greediness leads to disaster going.

16
00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.300
Maybe, maybe not.

17
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.219
I'm giving you one last chance to reconsider.

18
00:00:30.219 --> 00:00:31.980
How are you getting nervous on you, boy?

19
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.460
See, I can sense it.

20
00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.340
You're afraid that if this gets out,

21
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.140
you're both just going to become a laughingstock.

22
00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.619
These photos just show us hugging.

23
00:00:40.619 --> 00:00:42.140
It's normal social contact.

24
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.060
Why are you getting so worked up?

25
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.219
Social contact?

26
00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:47.539
Are you fucking mad?

27
00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:49.420
That's not acceptable!

28
00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.820
Under any circumstance, we're not a man to see.

29
00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.060
Aren't you and Jada socialising too?

30
00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:56.380
Oh shit, I was just being nice

31
00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.740
and plus she's a bloody leech anyway.

32
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.060
I can't wait more on my first.

33
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.100
I didn't even worry.

34
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.049
Ah ha ha ha!

35
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.659
Don't worry, even if you did have my phone intake.

36
00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.900
I've got plenty of backups, don't you, Boris?
