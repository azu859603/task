1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:06,830
Darling, why are you, why are you getting so worked up, don't you love me, don't you trust me anymore?

2
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:09,589
Shut up! Get off of me, you weasel.

3
00:00:09,589 --> 00:00:12,589
Everyone knows that our marriage was just a show anyway.

4
00:00:12,589 --> 00:00:15,589
You've lost me. You've fast given me all your assets.

5
00:00:15,589 --> 00:00:16,589
Never.

6
00:00:16,589 --> 00:00:18,719
Oh, a normal thing actually.

7
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:20,620
Slip with me.

8
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:25,690
Maybe. Just maybe.

9
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:30,579
Consider buying you a divorce gift. What do you want?

10
00:00:30,579 --> 00:00:33,579
I gave you a chance, but you're a little lover boy here.

11
00:00:33,579 --> 00:00:35,579
It just keeps taking all the decisions for you.

12
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:39,640
What are you going to do? I expose you to the media, of course.

13
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,640
Why would you do that?

14
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,640
Well, then you make you look like a bigger idiot.

15
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:48,640
If you can't control your wife or your marriage, you can't be CEO.

16
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,640
Shut up!

17
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:54,090
Don't you lay a hand on her. Get off me!

18
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,090
Who do you think you are? Duke of Woodspoon.

19
00:00:56,090 --> 00:01:00,500
And even if he was, for some reason on your side.

20
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,500
You think that the Jew is going to be on your side?

21
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,500
Look like I say, what's this get out? He's not going to be on yours, is he?

22
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,500
Illusional boy!

23
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,290
Here's on our side.

24
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:11,290
Because I am.

25
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:12,290
When I'll do it.

26
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:23,349
Throw a little party in the hall. See you in the bedroom.

27
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:24,379
Oh.

28
00:01:24,379 --> 00:01:28,459
I know you idiot.

29
00:01:28,459 --> 00:01:30,459
I mean, I'll give you animal entertainment.
