00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.379
Since I love you so much, you'll give me half of the assets, right?

2
00:00:05.379 --> 00:00:10.419
After all, I am the owner of the ring.

3
00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:13.179
I'm sure you can come to some arrangement, honey.

4
00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:26.289
Half of the assets. Dream art.

5
00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:38.829
When this is all over, I'll make sure you disappear too.

6
00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:41.390
Ooh, be careful.

7
00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:47.500
Why have someone sees us and takes another photo?

8
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.359
I'll just tell them that you're seducing your handsome assistant.

9
00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:53.359
You have quite the smallest talker.

10
00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:56.520
You'll be smooth or rough, whichever way you'd like.

11
00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.539
Marty, I hope my plan works.

12
00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:08.269
I'm sure, well, darling.

13
00:01:08.269 --> 00:01:11.340
You'll be able to go upstairs whilst I sort this out.

14
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.750
Er, are you trying to get rid of me?

15
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.069
Not at all. I just have some things to add.

16
00:01:18.069 --> 00:01:20.519
Okay, well, hurry up.

17
00:01:20.519 --> 00:01:21.519
Lost his orders.

18
00:01:21.519 --> 00:01:26.180
You're great.

19
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.180
I've lost my ring. I need you to find it.

20
00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.180
Yeah, sure, Grace.

21
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.180
And now it's to the city that the Duke of Woodsby will be attending the Amberal Company party in three days.

22
00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.180
You're good.

23
00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.170
Don't ask questions. I have a plan.

24
00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:50.150
You're acting strange.

25
00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:51.629
I'm not.

26
00:01:51.629 --> 00:01:52.629
Who was that man?

27
00:01:52.629 --> 00:01:54.629
Just a friend of my father's.

28
00:01:54.629 --> 00:01:58.980
Oh, he looked familiar. I'm sure I've seen him somewhere.
