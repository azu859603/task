1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,339
Oh, he looked familiar. I'm sure I've seen him somewhere.

2
00:00:04,339 --> 00:00:09,650
Oh, I remember. A coffee shop.

3
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:11,650
Down the street. He's a barista, right?

4
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:15,650
Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The barista.

5
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:19,649
If my plan fails, I won't be able to protect my sister's company.

6
00:00:19,649 --> 00:00:21,649
We'll lose everything.

7
00:00:21,649 --> 00:00:24,899
Gwen and Jada will be brought to justice. Trust me.

8
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:31,620
For my sister's sake, this has to work.

9
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:34,840
I'll do everything in my path to stop Gwen.

10
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,840
Yeah, he deserves everything he gets.

11
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:42,789
Harry, if I lied to you, would you leave me?

12
00:00:42,789 --> 00:00:45,109
It depends what you lied about.

13
00:00:45,109 --> 00:00:50,619
If you broke my heart, I'd have to break something else.

14
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:56,479
When the time is right, I'll tell you my identity, but not now.

15
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:07,379
Jada.

16
00:01:07,379 --> 00:01:09,379
Irene, I have the photos.

17
00:01:09,379 --> 00:01:14,379
If you don't want your fair to be exposed, meet me, alone.

18
00:01:14,379 --> 00:01:17,569
Fine. Let's see what Jada wants.
