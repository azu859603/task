00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:08.650
This is love, even for you.

2
00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:10.650
Can you walk? You're quite right.

3
00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.650
This doesn't change your fate now, does it?

4
00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.650
You're in my hands now. There's no escaping this time.

5
00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.120
You said you could handle wine, right?

6
00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.120
I'll make sure you drink plenty.

7
00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.690
I can't believe I ever considered you a friend.

8
00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:29.690
My friend? I didn't realize you considered me a friend.

9
00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:31.690
Oh, the great Irene.

10
00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:34.689
Oh, it's so great, weren't you?

11
00:00:34.689 --> 00:00:37.719
Who was throwing faves at me if you were in fucking eager?

12
00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:40.719
Irene, my dear, foolish and innocent sister,

13
00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:44.719
how could you let your good heart get stomped on by such trash?

14
00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:50.320
I helped you, your career. I helped promote you.

15
00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.320
You are grateful, bitch!

16
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.079
Don't do it, grateful one.

17
00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:58.079
You're lucky you're not even dead yet.

18
00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.079
But you will be. Soon.

19
00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:04.689
In this time, it won't be from such great height.

20
00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:07.849
You don't even remember that I've never moved to you.

21
00:01:07.849 --> 00:01:09.849
What about it?

22
00:01:09.849 --> 00:01:12.579
You caught me and went together.

23
00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:14.680
So do you avoid any issues, Irene?

24
00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.900
I followed you up to the roof.

25
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:17.900
And I pushed you.

26
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:18.900
It was a part.

27
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.290
Except for the fact that you're still alive.

28
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.290
So you weren't pushed away?

29
00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.290
Not just me, darling. Your dear husband.

30
00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.290
When? He also helped.
