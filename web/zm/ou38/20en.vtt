00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:06.179
Get off me! Your own husband bought did you dead, so he could take over the company and marry me!

2
00:00:06.179 --> 00:00:13.179
Who I never loved you. You're not even this type. He just used you to get where he needs to be to take over the company.

3
00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:17.460
I'm his true love.

4
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.899
And my buddy whispered it in my ear.

5
00:00:19.899 --> 00:00:24.739
Well, there wasn't just whispering that went down that night.

6
00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:28.780
Shit about Gwen!

7
00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:34.299
You know, he's scum! Compared to Daniel, he's nothing!

8
00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:39.649
I'm real, Irene. You never want to leave Gwen. She's meaningless without him.

9
00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:44.990
You've found him with such trashy, small dick men.

10
00:00:44.990 --> 00:01:04.079
Stice doesn't matter!

11
00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:08.430
Why so tense? Oh, look at that, a little bit of fun. You should be relaxed.

12
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.510
Get off me!
