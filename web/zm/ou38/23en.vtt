00:00:07.599 --> 00:00:12.699
Now, Jada took the ring, and if your names couldn't have married, give me their location now.

2
00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:16.699
If you're a guy and yourself, Mary really isn't worth risking a safety film.

3
00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:18.699
It's not a place to tell anyone to speak.

4
00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:22.589
I don't understand your problem with the Duke, Mary.

5
00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:27.589
I hate all hypocritical, rich snobs, just like my cheating father.

6
00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:29.589
I hope your Duke isn't like him.

7
00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:31.589
I don't think he'll be disappointed.

8
00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:35.229
Does my little publicize the Duke?

9
00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:37.229
You know the only person I idolize is you.

10
00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:42.250
Mary, I have something to tell you.

11
00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.250
The only reason why I'm interested in the Duke is because...

12
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.250
I know, I know that I'm yours.

13
00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:47.380
You're mine.

14
00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:52.460
It's time to stop playing games, okay?

15
00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.869
You need to get down to business.

16
00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:56.869
Yeah.

17
00:00:56.869 --> 00:01:00.060
We need to end this once and once.
