00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.769
Today's the day, Gwen. Today's the day.

2
00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:11.769
Irene and her assistant are truly the perfect match.

3
00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:15.859
Shh, keep it down, Gwen. Here's your miss.

4
00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:18.859
Today's a great day for you with the company being handed over.

5
00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:21.399
Cheer up, darling.

6
00:00:21.399 --> 00:00:23.399
There's a lot of reporters around.

7
00:00:23.399 --> 00:00:25.399
We should show a love.

8
00:00:25.399 --> 00:00:31.379
Oh, it'll be funny if you say. I've still got the spod of the one.

9
00:00:31.379 --> 00:00:32.380
Mary.

10
00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.939
Where do you think you're going?

11
00:00:36.939 --> 00:00:37.969
Ah, ah, ah.

12
00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:38.969
Let's remember, you're just an assistant.

13
00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.969
You ought to qualify to attend a high-class event of this nature.

14
00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:42.969
I'm the host.

15
00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:46.179
Are you high?

16
00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:48.390
Janiton!

17
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.390
How are you the host?

18
00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:50.390
Very funny.

19
00:00:50.390 --> 00:01:00.490
So we can't polish it, Dad.

20
00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.490
You can certainly eat one, eh? You fucking shit muncher?

21
00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:05.489
That's how you want. You want to come in?

22
00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.340
My shoes are rather dirty.

23
00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.730
Why don't you kneel down and maybe clean them up?

24
00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:14.730
Go on.

25
00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.730
See it as a promotion to your current responsibilities.

26
00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:25.099
Who is responsible for?

27
00:01:25.099 --> 00:01:28.099
Torturing my ears with this dreadful racket.

28
00:01:28.099 --> 00:01:29.099
Best you get down to the hospital.

29
00:01:29.099 --> 00:01:32.099
We get a checked out because we don't welcome weak old farts in here.

30
00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:34.099
Duke's butler, could the duke show up today?

31
00:01:34.099 --> 00:01:36.099
The butler's feel on the dukes we have.

32
00:01:36.099 --> 00:01:39.099
Mr. Graham, insult me as much as you like.

33
00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:40.099
I will.

34
00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:44.099
However, I advise you not to end a Mr. Daniel.
