1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,240
Great, now she has what?

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,269
Daniel, why aren't you here yet?

3
00:00:06,269 --> 00:00:10,339
We'll see if that little dog wants you once you have nothing left.

4
00:00:11,689 --> 00:00:13,689
How could I be the party?

5
00:00:13,689 --> 00:00:14,689
I'm doing it.

6
00:00:14,689 --> 00:00:20,899
I have an announcement. Gwen is going to be a father.

7
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:24,059
Well, I'm not quite yet.

8
00:00:24,059 --> 00:00:25,059
Yes, that's right.

9
00:00:25,059 --> 00:00:29,059
Gwen and I sell mates, but we can finally be together forever.

10
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:32,409
Okay, darling, can we discuss the meta later?

11
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:34,409
I mean, get news, obviously.

12
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:37,409
No, no, no, no. We've waited long enough.

13
00:00:37,409 --> 00:00:40,500
Besides, getting married soon.

14
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:46,500
Did you really just divorce me to marry my best friend?

15
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,500
Jada and I assault.

16
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,500
Irene forced me to marry her and threatened to kill Jada if I did.

17
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,789
Irene was a side chick, and she cheated.

18
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:54,789
She deserves this.

19
00:00:54,789 --> 00:00:55,789
I won.

20
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:58,859
Irene, I'm about to become the richest man in this city.

21
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:00,859
And I'll become the richest man's wife in the city.

22
00:01:00,859 --> 00:01:03,109
Don't be too jealous now.

23
00:01:03,109 --> 00:01:04,109
Oh, darling.

24
00:01:04,109 --> 00:01:05,109
What are you going to spend our money on?

25
00:01:05,109 --> 00:01:06,109
No.

26
00:01:06,109 --> 00:01:08,109
Well, like Irene's money.

27
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:11,109
It's a shame she works so hard and can get spend a penny.

28
00:01:11,109 --> 00:01:14,109
Bye, whatever you want, my beloved beauty.

29
00:01:14,109 --> 00:01:16,109
Enough.

30
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:18,109
It's time for the charade to end.

31
00:01:18,109 --> 00:01:23,500
I'm not Irene.
