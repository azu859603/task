1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,370
I'm not Irene.

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:08,109
What did you just say?

3
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:10,109
I'm Irene's twin sister.

4
00:00:10,109 --> 00:00:13,390
Mary.

5
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:14,390
That's impossible.

6
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:17,390
I've known Irene all my life, and she's never mentioned anything about twin sister.

7
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:19,390
I told you to lost the plot since I divorced you.

8
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,489
You belong everybody mental.

9
00:00:21,489 --> 00:00:22,489
Back in your hospital.

10
00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:24,489
I moved with my mom when I was young.

11
00:00:24,489 --> 00:00:25,489
It's a family secret.

12
00:00:25,489 --> 00:00:26,489
Of course you wouldn't know.

13
00:00:26,489 --> 00:00:28,489
You didn't wear the company's mind.

14
00:00:28,489 --> 00:00:29,489
Oh, is that so?

15
00:00:29,489 --> 00:00:32,490
This contract needed Irene's signature, but uh...

16
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:33,490
Oh no.

17
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:35,490
I'm Mary.

18
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:36,490
What are you trying to say?

19
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:39,490
I'm trying to say this agreement is invalid.

20
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:40,490
Bullshit!

21
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:45,490
This agreement was with Adderall, and you don't even own the company, so that means...

22
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:48,490
You're in breach of contract.

23
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:54,490
The penalty for breach of contract is astronomical.

24
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:55,490
What do you...

25
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:58,490
You might have to sell Jayda to pay for it.

26
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:01,579
I don't think you're gonna get very much for her though.

27
00:01:01,579 --> 00:01:03,579
She can't tell you the truth, can she?

28
00:01:03,579 --> 00:01:06,579
The truth and nothing but the truth.

29
00:01:06,579 --> 00:01:10,810
If you can't pay the penalty, you're gonna go to jail.

30
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:11,810
You and Jayda.

31
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:14,810
Oh, maybe you can get married there.

32
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:15,810
You're framing me!

33
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,810
What a vicious woman treating your brother-in-law like this.

34
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:20,810
Oh, my brother-in-law?

35
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:25,810
You're a fair led to my sister being pushed off a balcony!
