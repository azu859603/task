00:00:09,289 --> 00:00:11,320
They were behind her

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:18,399
Yeah, she discovered their affair and so to keep their secret. They push her off a balcony

4
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:26,800
Well and Jada can burn in hell if what she says is true, but she hasn't provided the evidence yet

5
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,060
You have no truth she wouldn't challenge me

6
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,700
In front of all these people

7
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:41,340

This is an ancestral ring the ring is real

14
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:25,430
Maybe it's not the Duke of Woodspree. It's the duchess of Woodspree

15
00:01:26,049 --> 00:01:33,109
That's right. I've seen it somewhere. Let me have another. No, no, no. Someone like you. It's not long to come near this game over Mary

That's right in the name of the duchess. I plan to invest 300 million

20
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,540
Gwen's name the duchess really is crazy rich

00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:05,200
300 million, you know, that's not even half the penalty duchess jade is that all you've got

Irene's fake sister little kid. Oh shut up Gwen bad enough for your shit

00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:56,030
You want evidence of them killing Irene? I've got it

30
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,430
Time for you to be exposed to the world

31
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,939
Not just me darling. Your dear husband when he also helped

32
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,810
So and that's not it. There's a voice note

33
00:03:11,289 --> 00:03:18,520
Go to hell you foolish woman. Oh my god. They are murderous the evidence that you wanted

34
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:25,560
Satisfied you know you know anymore you idiot. Why did you run your mouth job? Let me fix this. I'm the duchess now

35
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,479
I run this city

36
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:35,379
So what if I murder somebody no different than kidding and being a duchess gives you the right to kill people?

37
00:03:35,379 --> 00:03:38,780
Oh my god. I despise rich fucks like you

38
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:44,960
You just look all noble and fancy and pretty on the outside

39
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:51,159
You're filthy and rotten on the inside the Duchess of Woodscrew. You're really quite evil

40
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:54,060
I can't believe we believed

41
00:03:54,219 --> 00:03:57,449
Didn't stop the Duchess when I have the ring

42
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:00,810
Publicly impersonate the Duke of Woodscrew

43
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:05,550
What are you doing here old man? Who's telling the truth?

44
00:04:07,909 --> 00:04:16,819
You're still acting. Let's not get carried away. Shall we? Stop creating a scene with your man

45
00:04:17,379 --> 00:04:20,930
I don't know your garbage. I wouldn't want to get physical

46
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:28,740
Would I I think twice about doing that Gwen attacking Royston here is like slapping the face of the woods

47
00:04:32,569 --> 00:04:35,240
A fake just like her

48
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:41,009
You know very well, Jamie was in the duchess. You just get out of the way

49
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:48,100
You're an important little sin. You're an imbecile. You just need to keep his mouth shut. Get off me. Royston

50
00:04:48,819 --> 00:04:53,149
It's not me. It's there before

51
00:04:53,149 --> 00:05:09,180
You're grace. Give the order. I have the wrongs proof. Do you have? I am the witness witness

52
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:14,060
I'll see all this they believe you. Do you think the ring means everything? The whisper ring is in my hand

53
00:05:14,459 --> 00:05:18,579
The girl's needs to be said you don't need sus possessions to prove himself

54
00:05:19,459 --> 00:05:26,160
People with no status that need a little ring to prove themselves. It is only an accessory

55
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,680
everyone please

56
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:36,160
I'd like you to take one of these rings as a gift from the Duke of Woodsprew to prove that they mean

57
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:49,470
And one more thing Mary Brown my fiance

58
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:52,620
She orchestrated this whole plan

59
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:57,100
To expose you to the justice on her sister

60
00:06:00,019 --> 00:06:07,680
Irene called me just before she died

61
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:26,470
It's a little higher idea. Please family look off Gwen. Oh, you know the pursuit. Yes, he's a stain

62
00:06:29,269 --> 00:06:34,160
You would force me to bed with you, but you could confess your love and then decide if you

63
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:41,560
Record these two and expose them to the city

64
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:50,639
Tomorrow's headlines ready. Make sure to capture every detail to please. I'm pretty obsessed with you

65
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,600
I'll do anything sweet sweet Jane

66
00:06:54,160 --> 00:07:08,279
It's dog already has no no and one more thing. I'd like to make an announcement to miss Mary Brown. Miss Mary Brown

67
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:27,279
Will you marry? Crazy? I'm not a noble woman. I can't just marry a Duke. You say yes

68
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,990
You lied to me. Does it give you thrill?

69
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:34,769
Mary I keep me in the dark like this

70
00:07:35,050 --> 00:08:25,860
Mary only lied to you because I was trying to protect you Jada Gwen and Jada have been arrested

71
00:08:26,019 --> 00:08:32,000
Tell the prison self to keep them safe from my behalf the guards are signed to protect Miss Mary have returned

72
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:54,620
And Miss Mary need to keep this safe. You're grace

73
00:08:55,299 --> 00:08:57,690
You've been waiting all day

74
00:08:57,889 --> 00:09:01,179
You could just go up and see

75
00:09:01,659 --> 00:09:08,779
Just doesn't want to see me wasting. Why did my identity made it quite mad to be the Duke?

76
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:21,019
Why do you have to be one of those rich ass holes I despise and my sister?

77
00:09:21,419 --> 00:09:33,399
Oh, you're grace. Miss Mary has opened the curtains. Mary

78
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:48,889
You still have feelings for me, don't you? Mary's talk to me. Please. I miss you

79
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:56,149
I'll talk to strangers. I don't even know. I'm Daniel Vanderwood

80
00:09:57,909 --> 00:10:02,190
Everything ended when you hid your identity. You know you promised me no secrets

81
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:06,110
I only hid my identity because I was trying to protect you trying to protect me

82
00:10:06,629 --> 00:10:12,909
Stop treating me like a child Daniel. I'm trying to say is it not that matters. I don't care about you

83
00:10:13,429 --> 00:10:20,120
You know, I'm not I read anymore. So you just stop this believe me

84
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,360
Please in honor of the woods refamily in honor of the family

85
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:28,940
You don't get it. Do you? I'm just a normal girl, okay, and I love my normal life

86
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:32,059
And you're the elite and you know what we don't make a good match

87
00:10:32,059 --> 00:10:35,740
Mary, I love you all the cars gowns estates

88
00:10:36,299 --> 00:10:40,360
Castles even the stars doesn't mean anything. I'll throw it all away

89
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:46,740
I don't care about any of that. You know my dad promised my mom the world and then he's still abandoned her

90
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:54,419
I'll step down as the Duke. I don't care. It means nothing to me. You only mean something to me

91
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:57,159
Mary, please. You've got to listen to me

92
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:06,080
It's not fresh clean slate. Let's get to know each other as anyone Mary. Mary. I love you

93
00:11:06,419 --> 00:11:25,789

Favorite colors yellow

96
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,440
Favorite fruit was a melon like

97
00:11:39,679 --> 00:12:04,580
So that's how you won my sister back. It's pretty clichÃ© pretty much anyway

98
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:11,470
You're awake and Gwen and Jader in jail. I couldn't be happier. Thank you so much

99
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:17,419
For getting back everything I worked so hard for so grateful
