00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.990
Smell kind of you.

2
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.989
Stranger. Smell like a veil of whiskey was dumped on you.

3
00:00:40.659 --> 00:00:44.659
To the possibility of me and Celine work it together.

4
00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:48.659
I mean, I am literally dying with Josie.

5
00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:51.659
You two get to work for the male Miranda Priestley.

6
00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:52.659
I mean...

7
00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:53.659
Yeah.

8
00:00:58.119 --> 00:01:00.119
Again, please.

9
00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:01.119
Oh, thank you.

10
00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:03.119
Oh, Joslyn.

11
00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:04.120
It's a bit boss.

12
00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.120
I understand the pressure that you are under right now.

13
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.120
You are a top-notch designer.

14
00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.120
Well-known model, very successful businessman.

15
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.120
It's a lot on your plate, sir.

16
00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.120
But all eyes are on you right now.

17
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.120
You have to get some rest.

18
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.120
All I do is work.

19
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.120
I can't sleep.

20
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.120
My mind goes 10,000 miles an hour.

21
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:31.120
And at least with this, I can drink this and it'll give me something to sleep.

22
00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.120
Okay.

23
00:01:41.739 --> 00:01:52.159
We should dance.

24
00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:58.939
Favorite song just came on, so I will take this and I will.

25
00:01:58.939 --> 00:01:59.939
Who was that?

26
00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:00.939
You know, shit's given, girl.

27
00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:03.680
That's one of my favorites all.

28
00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.700
We have to investigate.

29
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:14.479
You don't care if anyone sees you, do you?

30
00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:17.479
Nice to be sure to care about what people think.

31
00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:19.830
Who are you?

32
00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.530
It doesn't matter.

33
00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:24.530
And me.

34
00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:25.530
And you.

35
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:26.819
Are you.

36
00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.169
And now, we're dancing.

37
00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:31.490
I don't know what you're hearing.

38
00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:36.129
You know, this and you are exactly what I need.

39
00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:40.379
And what if I want to tell you that I want more?
