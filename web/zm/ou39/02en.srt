1
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:22,559
What have I done?

2
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:26,289
Such a mess when you drink.

3
00:00:26,289 --> 00:00:28,510
I remember you slept with me.

4
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:55,539
I am so sorry for me to do it.

5
00:00:55,539 --> 00:00:56,539
Is it over?

6
00:00:56,539 --> 00:00:58,539
Then I could just wall fight.

7
00:00:58,539 --> 00:01:03,539
He would have on any other day, but he's late too, so, you know, it never happens.

8
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:06,540
What happened? Did you oversleep?

9
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,540
I went to this hotel room with this guy.

10
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:11,540
Oh.

11
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:13,540
Well, mine is, yeah.

12
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,540
It's so wild.

13
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,540
It's so hot.

14
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:21,560
Oh, God.

15
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,560
I was lost in the hotel room. Damn it.

16
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,560
Oh, well.

17
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,560
Those are custom-made friendship earrings.

18
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,560
I'm a shitty friend.

19
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,560
No, you're not. I get it.

20
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,560
Hot dudes before house.

21
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,560
I'm sure we can get your replacement.

22
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,069
He's here!

23
00:01:37,069 --> 00:01:52,150
Oh.

24
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:53,250
Morning, Mr. Holzer.

25
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,250
This is Celine.

26
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:58,250
She had that design and that pitch meeting last week that you liked, and her ear instructions.

27
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:01,250
She is now in the junior design team.

28
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:07,890
Wait. It's you.
