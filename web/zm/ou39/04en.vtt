00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.839
So, do you have any questions about my resume?

2
00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:14.320
We have a saying in the fashion world, you wear who you are, and honestly with your presentation

3
00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.440
right here, I feel like I don't even need to read your resume.

4
00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:23.079
It doesn't remember me from last night, that's a good thing, but...

5
00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:30.160
I know I've not majored in fashion, I apologize for not making myself presentable.

6
00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:36.640
Today, due to personal reasons, but I'm a hard worker and I'm smart.

7
00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.159
I graduated top of my class at CalArts.

8
00:00:40.159 --> 00:00:45.359
I understand the creative process, and I'm not applying for a designer job here, am I?

9
00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:52.240
Isn't it better for your assistant to be more keen on learning and catering to your needs

10
00:00:52.240 --> 00:01:00.420
as opposed to spending the day thinking about how to climb up the corporate ladder?

11
00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:06.219
Unfortunately, wanting to be in the fashion world is a prerequisite, so I am unable to

12
00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:10.180
extend you an offer today at this time, Miss...

13
00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.939
McCartney, you can call me Nia.

14
00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.500
Thank you for the opportunity.

15
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:31.870
Yes, wait, you drew this.

16
00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:40.530
Today is your lucky day, you're hired, Miss Rinkley Hoodie and Dirty Sneakers.
