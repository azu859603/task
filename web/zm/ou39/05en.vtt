00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Miss wrinkled hoodie and dirty sneakers.

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.160
You know, I should be happy that I got the job, but...

3
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.160
Condescending tone really gets on my nerves.

4
00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.160
I mean, he's not wrong though.

5
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.769
Well, still.

6
00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:17.769
Plus, you could take one look at him and you know he's a playboy.

7
00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:20.769
That he sleeps with random women on a daily basis.

8
00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:24.769
You know, you shouldn't talk about his private life.

9
00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:26.769
He's our boss after all.

10
00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:29.769
Yeah, I should probably tell you something.

11
00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:30.769
I have a boyfriend now.

12
00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:31.769
What?

13
00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:32.770
When?

14
00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.770
And most importantly, who is the unbelievably lucky bastard?

15
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.770
You don't know him.

16
00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.770
But you're gonna introduce him to me in Qatar, right?

17
00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:43.899
Hello.

18
00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:45.899
Be at that.

19
00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.310
Of course.

20
00:00:47.310 --> 00:01:09.090
Miss Celine, I presume I've been sent here to pick you up on a date.

21
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.090
I was unaware of this, but sure.

22
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.540
Kind of boyfriend you got there, the Prince of England.

23
00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.260
Where are we going?

24
00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:35.819
What's wrong?

25
00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:37.819
We didn't see him this last night.

26
00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:39.040
I...

27
00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.609
I'll just...

28
00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:46.500
I'm sorry, I'm just a little clumsy.

29
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.500
Look, she's looking for you.
