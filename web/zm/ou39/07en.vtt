1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.860
Yeah, we both tend to like the same things.

2
00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:11.009
Nia, to dreams coming true.

3
00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:13.009
To jobs that pay the right.

4
00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:14.009
Yeah, okay.

5
00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.010
I wish you could have been there.

6
00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.010
And the girls that work there, they're all silly.

7
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.010
So beautiful, so fashionable.

8
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:29.010
You know, I'm not the insecure type, but it made me feel really so conscious.

9
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.009
What are you talking about? You are so beautiful.

10
00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.009
And you are fashionable, and above all else, you are talented.

11
00:00:37.009 --> 00:00:40.009
I mean, Nia means purpose, right?

12
00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:43.009
And like you said, it's a job that pays the rent.

13
00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:46.009
You finish my graphic novel at night.

14
00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:50.009
I always meet you in my corner.

15
00:00:50.009 --> 00:00:55.579
Mr. Holzer, I thought you already found a girl you might hear the other night.

16
00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:56.579
I did.

17
00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.000
I didn't feel right. I can't put my finger on it.

18
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000
That's...

19
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.280
That's the most system you just hired.

20
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.280
It looks like we're not making the job demanding enough for her.

21
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.280
We've got time for doodles and dates with our boyfriend.

22
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:27.079
Where is the pitch deck that I asked you to prepare?

23
00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:28.430
I'm supposed to have advice.

24
00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.430
Good evening, Mr. Holzer.

25
00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.430
To be fair, you said you wanted it to be finished soon.

26
00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:40.430
If you change your mind, I could go back to the office and finish it tonight.

27
00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.670
No, don't go to the office.

28
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.019
Come to my house.
