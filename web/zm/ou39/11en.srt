1
00:00:01,139 --> 00:00:12,910
Don't mess it up by dressing like an idiot again. How about this one?

2
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,640
No, it's too formal. I mean, you're not you're not going to funeral, right?

3
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:27,039
No, it's too casual. I mean, it wouldn't even let you down a tennis court right now on us, buddy.

4
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:29,679
You really don't know how to dress for the occasion to you.

5
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:32,560
Hey, I'm just

6
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:38,759
Now what use to this new fashion scene? I know. I know. Hey, look. Hey. Yeah

7
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,200
There we go. Oh

8
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:48,359
Well, it's a good thing that you've got like a natural eye for the beauty and photography and

9
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:53,520
literature, so you shouldn't think of fashion as this isolated island of a thing, right?

10
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:59,219
All our friends are connected and plus you look beautiful in everything

11
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:28,459
everything

12
00:01:28,459 --> 00:01:35,319
Right. Where's your ugly little friend who embarrassed by her pathetic style to show up?

13
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:41,439
I mean, this isn't really her scene, but she's trying. So I have to try a lot harder than she has.

14
00:01:41,920 --> 00:02:08,629
Anyone want a cupcake?

15
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:16,990
James, is this part of your line? I love it. It's so modern day Audrey had burned. My daughters would wear the hell out of that

16
00:02:17,509 --> 00:02:24,770
And the model shall we say is dropped it gorgeous too. Oh, it is. It's not

17
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:27,550
Mr. Broham, this is

18
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:34,590
Merely one of the ideas. Mr. Holzer is testing out. You already like this one. Your mind will be blown by the rest of the collection. I

19
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:38,990
Can see the seams on your dress? Did you make it yourself? I didn't know that you could sew

20
00:02:39,590 --> 00:03:12,560
Dumb beginner's look to change into a let's go to the bathroom. It's gonna be okay. Look. Let me just I don't need you

21
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:25,900
To come to my rescue. I can do it myself. It is something wrong, Sleen. I'm sorry

22
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:31,699
It's just that I totally embarrassed myself and you you just you don't even care about fashion

23
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,580
You didn't study it

24
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:44,849
But you somehow pull off a modern day retro scheme out of nowhere. I had help cut her healthy. Of course you did and of course

25
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:56,360
You're just always good at whatever you do. I'm regretting recommending you to work here. I might just be lucky

26
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:05,620
Somehow just worked. I don't even know what I'm doing

27
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:16,779
That's not true. I know you work hard and you have killer instincts

28
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:27,220
I'm sorry. Okay, like you totally deserve a thumbs up tonight. Thank god damn

29
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:31,060
You really do look like a modern day article. How?

30
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:53,100
Here me help you Nia

31
00:04:55,100 --> 00:05:15,639
Try sometimes

32
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:30,920
Why is my heart beating out of my chest? Did I see it right? He felt that I let drip Joel too. I didn't have to do all the streams

33
00:05:32,459 --> 00:05:48,839
Although I have been mad. I've always wanted to come here. Of course. Have you heard that some blue perfume that I smell?

34
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:54,560
Smells different than the last one

35
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,230
Yeah

36
00:05:56,230 --> 00:06:04,089
Yeah, I recently switched brands like the old one me too. I just ran out of my last one

37
00:06:05,089 --> 00:06:10,810
So Lane you don't have to be so formal with me. We're not at work. We're all alone

38
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:21,389
Where's that carefree girl that I met out of miss her? I have one thing. Oh

39
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:26,370
Actually, I guess we'll have a bottle you can handle it, right?

40
00:06:30,339 --> 00:06:32,339
Yeah

41
00:06:32,339 --> 00:06:38,180
Long day, huh?

42
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:41,300
I mean do you think Celine's coming home with a boyfriend though?

43
00:06:41,779 --> 00:06:47,560
Like who is that guy if she tells you everything why didn't she tell you about that? I know right. I

44
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,689
Just hope he's good to her

45
00:06:50,889 --> 00:07:00,410
Otherwise he'll have me to answer to what I could be here if it weren't for Celine

46
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:17,449
I just want to say thanks Celine for organizing this awesome party

47
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:20,709
You guys are the best president I could ask for

48
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:24,769
Cheers

49
00:07:25,769 --> 00:07:30,350
Now what do you want to do birthday girl? Oh, yeah

50
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:44,800
Before we join them can I talk to you for a second?

51
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:48,829
cover I

52
00:07:48,829 --> 00:07:53,870
Thinking about this a lot and I want to tell you that it's it's Nia's birthday

53
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:57,439
I don't I don't think we should keep awaying, right?

54
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:43,289
Are you okay? You went a little too wild there or they girl save my life

55
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:49,250
I'm gonna have to repay you for your birthday next month

56
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:53,970
Choke you're okay

57
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:35,799
We'll show you you met okay

58
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:46,059
We should go check the least let's go this way this way okay, I want to just take a seat

59
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:05,809
What I think that you should take some rest. I'm gonna take a shot

60
00:10:05,889 --> 00:10:28,429
Do we go shopping tomorrow and find any catch? No that spot is

61
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:54,240
Actually growing on me

62
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:03,730
Oh my god cutter. It's you. I'm so sorry. It was just my reflexes. Why were you so close to me?

63
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:18,129
I'm sorry Celine. I feel really tired all of a sudden

64
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:24,529
Maybe you should go home tonight, and I want to make clear about one thing again. We're still trying this thing out

65
00:11:25,049 --> 00:11:26,240
Okay

66
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,240
Yes, of course

67
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,000
I'm keeping it casual too. No labels just on

68
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:36,100
Good good night, Celine

69
00:11:39,669 --> 00:11:42,100
James of course not

70
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:48,820
Why would I think about James cuz he's like all you ever talk about and I mean he's clearly into you

71
00:11:54,730 --> 00:12:00,840
Gampy is he great next urgent situation

72
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,279
Roxy had to drop out of the promo shoot with you today her agent

73
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,759
Let me know this morning because her boat talks went all right

74
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:14,159
Do we push it or no no we can't push it we have to get the sun for peak capital

75
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:20,399
Is there anybody else that we can reach out to simple modeling job and footage will be edited anyway?

76
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,559
Maybe we can get one of the girls from the office to do it. How about Celine you're slender and pretty

77
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:33,399
Celine would be a great choice. I remember one of our photographers miss took her farm model on set one

78
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:35,559
That's right. I was there

79
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:41,549
Okay, do you think you can do it? I think so you think so

80
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:48,120
Okay, we have no time. Can you please stand up so we could see if the outfits will fit you like Roxy's body

81
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,580
Do a spin

82
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:55,399

00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:59,120
Excuse me. Hey, hi. Yes, you you can please come in here, please. Thank you

84
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,799
Jocelyn let's have her do it. Mr. Broyam likes her already and as I can see her waist is a little bit smaller

85
00:13:06,769 --> 00:13:11,809
Yeah, that'll fit better. Okay, so we you're gonna assist on this shoot. Thank you for the spin

86
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:36,059
Are you all right?

87
00:13:36,059 --> 00:13:43,350
Knee of the model because she has a similar body tucked her up. You understand and I also don't want special treatment just because I'm here

88
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:49,950
My what? Celine we've talked about this. I know but you know that another kind of girl who took all night

89
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:55,590
Like nothing. I'm not that you're responsible type. That's why I'm giving this

90
00:13:56,190 --> 00:14:03,429
Us even a chance aren't I? No, but Celine on the makeup people and the

91
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:08,889
photographer can't decide on a good pair of earrings and you to wear. Can I just borrow your ears, you know?

92
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:10,889
Yes, of course

93
00:14:11,049 --> 00:14:22,399
Mr. Holzer you're here, too

94
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,720
Did I interrupt something? No, no

95
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:30,039
Pat two shots from the list and

96
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:36,519
It was a time. Yes. Got it. Mr. Holzer. Come on. We have a very tight spatula

97
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:51,279
Can we have the female model in her first outfit take her position so we can test the light air in outfit, please

98
00:14:52,960 --> 00:15:00,080
Yeah, come here. Can't you do this?

99
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:06,320
This is so crazy. Can you imagine me a model go go go talk after?

100
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,870
He makes eyes like that

101
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:41,629
That's how it looks straight out. My friend has underwear

102
00:15:42,269 --> 00:16:04,820
Well, I know we were going for provocative, but I didn't think we're going this far. I think this is my work. Don't you think?

103
00:16:05,379 --> 00:16:10,379
Absolutely smashing. March is gorgeous. Okay. How about you strike a few poses for me?

104
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:18,919
Stunning. Perfect. I love that pose. Perfect. She is such a natural truly something

Perfect. I love it. We're loving it. How about James? How about you? How about you join her?

107
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,879
This is just a one sequence and I'm looking for an

108
00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:01,200
Old timey singing on a rain style dance with smiles and all please please

109
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:07,519
Sorry, no, no. No, that was great. Don't be sorry. Just keep it going. Keep it going. Perfect. Yes

110
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,880
I love this loving it crashing to each other

111
00:17:14,259 --> 00:17:16,259
Okay, how about oh

113
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:25,700
final spin and then let's end on a classic pose you grab her by the waist James you lean back near

114
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:28,099
I'm loving this. I'm loving this

115
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:32,359
And cut

116
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:37,140
Perfect

117
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:41,220
So you do dance do you also wear the same perfume as silly?

118
00:17:44,789 --> 00:17:48,839
What?

119
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:51,079
Oh, that was H-O-T

120
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:57,480
Oh god, I could feel the electricity through the screen now. Are you two aren't really dating each other in real life? No

121
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,400
Not because I don't want to

122
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:08,880
Wait, wait. I'm not saying I don't want to date him either. Can we just get back to work? Is there really nothing going on between the two of you?

123
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:12,470
Oh, did I just strike a nerve? No

124
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:17,990
Why don't we just go ahead with the second look? Okay, let's get back to work everyone back to work

125
00:18:18,549 --> 00:18:26,279
We

126
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:28,279
Feeling a way to replace her placement

127
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,700
There's a way

128
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:37,460
What? I know I know this wrinkled hoodie and dirty sneakers is becoming a favorite of his

129
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,130
I have to quickly

130
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:45,910
Don't you think? I mean, I know she's supposed to be her friend and all but all of saying her do is get ahead of you

131
00:18:52,640 --> 00:19:25,039
Yeah, you're supposed to be my friend. Why do you keep stepping on me? Let's go home for him

132
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:32,039
I did

133
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:48,710
Give me a little jump both

134
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:10,519
Thank god, okay, so leave what what happened you fell down when you're on set

135
00:20:13,569 --> 00:20:21,240
I'm sorry. Did I ruin the shoe? That's what you're worried about right now. Well, yeah, it's very important to you, isn't it?

136
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:25,970
Don't worry about the shoe. Okay. You got hurt pretty badly. You suffered a mild

137
00:20:26,529 --> 00:20:29,009
Electric shock and you have a concussion

138
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:38,339
I'm all right. Look. Look. Hey, take it easy here. It's

139
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:44,150
I'm just a little dizzy. I'm okay

140
00:20:45,250 --> 00:21:00,180
Celine

141
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:03,779
Thank you. Mr. Hoser. Look, you can call me James and

142
00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:06,900
Don't thank me

143
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:10,339
You just need to be less clumsy. You can't be getting hurt. You are very

144
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:13,220
I am

145
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:16,180
What? You're the face of the new collection

146
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:24,599
And I'm going to need you more and there have been two instances where your instincts have proven

147
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,799
Pretty good the Audrey Hepburn outfit

148
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,529
The sash that you wore today

149
00:21:30,609 --> 00:21:32,180
So

150
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:35,779
I'll be promoting you on the design and editorial side of things

151
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:39,910
I know that you never wanted to be in fashion

152
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:46,309
And that you wanted to write your own graphic novel, right? All this promotion will help you

153
00:21:47,029 --> 00:21:48,470
It is

154
00:21:48,470 --> 00:22:13,299
She got to let you cute and took a fall. Is she alive? Where is she? She's inside. She's

155
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:17,730
Okay, I think

156
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:21,240
She just woke up but I fucked up cuz

157
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:29,140
It's all my fault. What does that mean? Do you want this?

158
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,400
Personally to be a fall

159
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:38,559
Maybe she would twist your ankle and can't do the shoot anymore. That's all I didn't wait to

160
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:46,049
It's also your boyfriend

161
00:22:46,049 --> 00:22:47,569
Celine

162
00:22:47,569 --> 00:22:52,210
You elected you did your best friend for a guy. I mean that billionaire douche bagel

163
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:20,819
It was an accident. I just wanted to give her a small lesson especially since she's openly seducing my boyfriend

164
00:23:22,519 --> 00:23:29,640
You rushed over here. All worried about her. You interrogate me writing on your freaking high moral horse

165
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:34,119
You've always been in love with her but you're too chicken to tell her

166
00:23:35,799 --> 00:23:37,319
Now look at you

167
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:41,319
You are finally where I was when I had a crush on you back in college

168
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,640
The one not picked

169
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:47,960
The one who stayed close with me just so you can get closer to Nia

170
00:23:48,759 --> 00:23:54,500
I'm sorry. No, don't apologize now. Okay. I've moved on from you cutter

171
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,920
I'm glad now. You know how it felt

172
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:01,279
Because as long as there's Nia, I'll always be reminded that

173
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:06,240
Some people are just born the stars of this life thing

174
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:08,839
And you and me

175
00:24:08,839 --> 00:24:12,119
Somehow we're bound to be their supporting characters

176
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:14,279
Can you blame me?

177
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:18,279
For trying to come into the foreground in my life. I still can't let you work

178
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:36,150
Celine, I can't I can't let you do that. Please try. Have we kissed you?

179
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:39,759
I've seen that

180
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:42,720
You have your ears pierced but you never wear any earrings

181
00:24:50,289 --> 00:24:51,700
Nia

182
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:57,380
Should I file an occupational hazard lawsuit against Mr. Holzer because Celine just told me that

183
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,640
It was an exposed wire that caused her fall on set

184
00:25:02,529 --> 00:25:03,650
No

185
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:07,269
Cutter, what are you talking about? I trip. That's it

186
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:12,519
Exposed cable or not. You know me. I trip walking on flat ground

187
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:15,000
I'm not gonna sue him

188
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,079
Fine

189
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:18,160
But Mr. Holzer if she gets her in your office

190
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:21,160
I'm gonna show you

191
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,259
Um

192
00:25:22,339 --> 00:25:23,299
This is

193
00:25:23,299 --> 00:25:24,579
Cutter my

194
00:25:24,579 --> 00:25:26,579
Very good friend since college

195
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,480
Cutter

196
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,210
James Holzer

197
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:31,910
You know

198
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:35,480
The boss

199
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:38,279
She won't get hurt ever again. I can assure you

200
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:42,279
Not on my watch and I will find out who's responsible if that exposed cable, okay

201
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:45,079
Well, you should go get on that then

202
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:48,200
Having you been away from your super important office long enough

203
00:25:55,569 --> 00:26:03,079
Joss. Yes. What is it?

204
00:26:03,079 --> 00:26:06,599
See you knew this aggressive since our college team lost a Duke. Well

205
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:08,950
I was

206
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:14,630
Worried about you and I felt unfair for you. I mean you've done so much for that job and

207
00:26:15,269 --> 00:26:17,750
Now you're in the hospital

208
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:19,779
Here in Celine

209
00:26:19,779 --> 00:26:21,779
Do you really care about me so much?

210
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,289
Trust me

211
00:26:24,289 --> 00:26:26,769
I'm really fine

212
00:26:26,769 --> 00:26:30,200
I was actually having a lot of fun being a fashion model

213
00:26:31,299 --> 00:26:33,140
Before you know

214
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,819
This

215
00:26:34,819 --> 00:26:37,119
I saw you kiss him

216
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:38,950
That

217
00:26:39,029 --> 00:26:40,549
Was an accident. I

218
00:26:40,549 --> 00:26:43,750
I went for his cheek and he turned. Oh, you remember that he has a girlfriend

219
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,680
You're right. I

220
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,680
But but it really was an accident

221
00:26:51,559 --> 00:26:59,890
Did you want to kiss him for real? Oh

222
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:01,650
I'm a really shitty person, aren't I? No

223
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:04,759
We all make mistakes. Don't we?

224
00:27:07,029 --> 00:27:11,000
You're not a bad person. You could never be that

225
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:16,230
You're actually the most incredible person I know

226
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:19,279
Yeah, I wanted to tell you to

227
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:26,960
It looks like I forgot my water

228
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,960
Everybody knew that you had a reputation

229
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:45,079
A playboy

230
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:46,200
A heartbreaker

231
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:50,680
And you might think that that's a good reputation to have but I can tell you right now that it is not

232
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,680
A good man

233
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,519
Stays true to the one that he loves

234
00:27:55,519 --> 00:27:59,839
And doesn't go around kissing other people's girls when he already has a girlfriend

235
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,160
Nia is not your girlfriend and I don't

236
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,559
Celine is his girlfriend

237
00:28:09,559 --> 00:28:11,559
I don't know
