1
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:09,580
I feel like an old sickly lady.

2
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:15,580
Well, the last F in BFF is forever, isn't it?

3
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:22,579
So, when we're both old and sickly, we might end up talking here just like right now.

4
00:00:22,579 --> 00:00:28,539
Celine, I really didn't know you and James were dating.

5
00:00:28,539 --> 00:00:31,539
The kiss really was an accident.

6
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:35,539
When did you guys start dating the night at the bar?

7
00:00:35,539 --> 00:00:39,469
I know accidents happen.

8
00:00:39,469 --> 00:00:44,130
We don't have to talk about it.

9
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:50,119
I know about James' history and his reputation.

10
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:57,609
But, Nia, will you promise me one thing though?

11
00:00:57,609 --> 00:01:02,630
Promise me you won't steal him from me.

12
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:22,230
He's everything I've always wanted.

13
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:24,540
Oh.

14
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,540
People actually like being here?

15
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:27,540
Apparently.

16
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,890
Welcome back.

17
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:33,890
There's no one else I'd rather see.

18
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:37,019
Could it be a cutter?

19
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:40,430
Nia, can you come here, please?
