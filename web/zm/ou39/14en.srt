00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:02,020
Nia, can you come here, please?

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:04,019
Quick announcement.

3
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:08,259
Nia is the newest junior designer.

4
00:00:08,259 --> 00:00:10,259
Congratulations, Nia!

5
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:12,869
Well deserved.

6
00:00:12,869 --> 00:00:13,869
Thank you.

7
00:00:13,869 --> 00:00:14,869
My house.

8
00:00:14,869 --> 00:00:20,739
Sush is back now.

9
00:00:20,739 --> 00:00:23,129
Stronger than ever.

10
00:00:23,129 --> 00:00:25,859
How long did it take you to get that position?

11
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,859
Five years.

12
00:00:27,859 --> 00:00:28,929
Took her what?

13
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:31,089
Five weeks.

14
00:00:31,089 --> 00:00:33,340
Oh, you gave up.

15
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:37,590
Oh, the BFF team is back in action now, huh?

16
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:43,789
Well, of course part is she didn't want any of us.

17
00:00:43,789 --> 00:01:09,859
So what are you going to do about it now?

18
00:01:09,859 --> 00:01:13,469
Second dry desk book sketchbooks.

19
00:01:13,469 --> 00:01:16,469
Thank you so much, Selene, your life saver.

20
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:17,469
Yeah, of course, Nia.

21
00:01:17,469 --> 00:01:25,099
Anything for you?
