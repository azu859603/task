00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:25.829
This is a little last of them.

2
00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:28.449
It's Mr. Huggle-Buggled.

3
00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:30.379
Mr. Huggle-Buggled?

4
00:00:30.379 --> 00:00:42.539
Why don't you look into Mr. Huggle-Buggled's eyes?

5
00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:46.219
So besides Celine and Cutter, there's nobody else in your apartment.

6
00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:48.500
And no signs of the treatment.

7
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.280
None that we could spot in any way.

8
00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.880
The good thing is the cameras that we have are brand new,

9
00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.810
once they're out of the tag on it.

10
00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.450
And now that's a look to see if the person who brought the cameras

11
00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.539
was careless enough to leave the behind.

12
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.540
You sure you want to do that?

13
00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.659
You're going to ruin your expensive suit?

14
00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:08.620
No, it's not.

15
00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:09.659
No expense to me.

16
00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:10.659
I bought them.

17
00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:17.359
Cool.
