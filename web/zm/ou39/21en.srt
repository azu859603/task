00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,169
I'm not seeing anything helpful you.

2
00:00:15,169 --> 00:00:16,170
No.

3
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:20,000
Well, thank you.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Of course.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Who would have thought dumpster diving would be on the fancy impeccable Mr. Hulser schedule today?

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:37,509
Well, um, take the rest of the day off.

7
00:00:37,509 --> 00:00:58,780
We'll get to the bottom of this.

8
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:01,840
Now I'm gonna get into my office now.

9
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,840
You have some explaining to do.
