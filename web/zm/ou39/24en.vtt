You said the couch was a gift from someone important. Who was it? My mom

2
00:00:14.939 --> 00:00:16.940
Apologize to her from me

3
00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:24.140
She's passed away. She died while I was working. Oh

4
00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:34.579
God, I am so so sorry. I really messed up big time didn't I?

5
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.200
For what it's worth I

6
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.640
I

7
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.060

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.780
Celine up. I

12
00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:00.460
Was doing research on how to clean Mark's office sheepskin. They might not work, but it's fine

13
00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:09.549
You can keep the dirty spot. I kind of like it that way. It reminds me of you
