It was you, I've noticed it's all alone, you have your ears pierced but you never wear

00:00:33.409 --> 00:00:40.500
earrings except that one time I lost my favorite pair of earrings and I guess I

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.780
didn't feel like wearing them anymore. You lost a pair of them? What did they look like?

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:52.420
Well I didn't lose a pair, I lost just one. They were little tiny champagne bottles.

Celine and I bought them together. They're kind of like our friendship earrings.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.520

The perfume, the earrings, that wasn't Celine, that was you and you.
