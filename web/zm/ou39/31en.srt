1
00:00:01,139 --> 00:00:07,120
No, there's that smile that I fell in love with.

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,320
Did he just say he's in love with me?

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,519
Shit, shit, shit.

4
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:12,519
This is when you drop the L word.

5
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:14,580
James Holzer, you hate.

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,579
I should say something back.

7
00:00:16,579 --> 00:00:18,179
What do I say?

8
00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:19,179
Do I love him?

9
00:00:19,179 --> 00:00:20,179
What is she thinking?

10
00:00:20,179 --> 00:00:21,780
Could she tell that I'm freaking out?

11
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:22,980
I need to say something.

12
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:23,980
But what?

13
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:28,230
I think I don't know with you two.

14
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:31,640
What did you just say?

15
00:00:31,640 --> 00:01:01,689
I said I, too, fell in love with you the first night we met.

16
00:01:01,689 --> 00:01:04,780
So, did you talk to Celine?

17
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:09,819
Did you find her?
