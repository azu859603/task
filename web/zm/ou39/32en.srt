1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:04,059
Did you find her?

2
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:07,209
No.

3
00:00:07,209 --> 00:00:10,339
It's like she disappeared off the face of the earth.

4
00:00:10,339 --> 00:00:12,339
She won't return any of my calls.

5
00:00:12,339 --> 00:00:16,339
James fired her so she won't be at work anymore.

6
00:00:16,339 --> 00:00:22,339
I'm in such a conflicted state because she broke my fucking heart.

7
00:00:22,339 --> 00:00:29,190
Yet at the same time, my heart is full because I'm with James.

8
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:32,020
Celine braided me too.

9
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:34,020
For being a coward.

10
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,850
For not telling you how I actually felt about you.

11
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,850
But truthfully, I think you've always known.

12
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,539
You want to stay friends?

13
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:48,090
You don't want things to get awkward.

14
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,979
And, you know, I want the same.

15
00:00:50,979 --> 00:00:52,979
So no more awkwardness.

16
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:56,210
You know, no more one-sided feelings.

17
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:59,210
At least I'll try to stop them from now on.

18
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:00,750
Come on.

19
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:06,129
Come on, a big hug for an old friend.

20
00:01:06,129 --> 00:01:09,319
That way we don't have to talk about this anymore.

21
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:11,319
I mean, God, that was painful.

22
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:20,430
I do love you, Patrick.

23
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:29,730
Oh, hey.

24
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:30,730
Hey.

25
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:31,730
Hey.

26
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:33,819
You okay?

27
00:01:33,819 --> 00:01:34,909
What's going on?

28
00:01:34,909 --> 00:01:39,590
Oh, we should go.

29
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:40,590
Yeah.

30
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:41,590
Let's go.

31
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:47,170
Yeah.

32
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:48,170
Positive.

33
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:49,739
I'm pregnant.

34
00:01:49,739 --> 00:01:51,739
Oh, my God.

35
00:01:51,739 --> 00:01:53,870
Oh, there's my way.

36
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:56,939
Oh, my God.

37
00:01:56,939 --> 00:01:58,939
Oh, my God.

38
00:01:58,939 --> 00:02:13,939
Oh, my God.

39
00:02:13,939 --> 00:02:18,939
Oh, my God.

40
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:24,939
Oh, my God.
