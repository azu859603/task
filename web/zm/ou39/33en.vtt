1
00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.240
I've got to go.

2
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.240
Huh?

3
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:12.939
Didn't you promise Mr. Broham you'd get the memo in today?

4
00:00:12.939 --> 00:00:13.939
I don't want to.

5
00:00:13.939 --> 00:00:17.940
Did I make the world famous workaholic James Holz

6
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.940
or not want to work anymore?

7
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:20.940
Hmm.

8
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:21.940
Have I done this in the hospital?

9
00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:23.940
I think you have.

10
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.030
Me and McCartney.

11
00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:41.969
Because all I want to do, all day, is you.

12
00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.969
Hey Josh, help me right there.

13
00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:49.039
I'll be here when you get back.

14
00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:51.229
Not going anywhere.

15
00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:52.229
You promise?

16
00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:53.549
Promise.

17
00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:55.549
Because they waited long enough to find you.

18
00:00:55.549 --> 00:01:08.409
And, uh, when you get back,

19
00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:12.099
it may have something to tell you.

20
00:01:12.099 --> 00:01:13.939
Not good.

21
00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:16.739
You have all two of these.
