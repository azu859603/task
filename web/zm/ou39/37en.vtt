00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:27.170
My baby with Jake.

2
00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:33.770
Then again, you guys were even out.

3
00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:40.840
I came to say, despite all of that's happened, you're my best friend in the whole world.

4
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.520
You helped me through so much.

5
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.500
You were always there for me.

6
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.119
And because I had you, I was too happy to.

7
00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:54.399
And over my head, I never noticed how you felt.

8
00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:56.920
I overlooked you feelings more than once.

9
00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.909
I wasn't the best friend you deserved.

10
00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:01.909
And for that, I was worried.

11
00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:04.390
You shouldn't apologize to me, I'm full of hushies.

12
00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.349
I'm not finished yet.

13
00:01:07.349 --> 00:01:13.829
But for as bad of a friend as I was, I still didn't deserve the way you treated me.

14
00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:16.069
You almost electrocuted me.

15
00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:17.629
You creeped on me.

16
00:01:17.629 --> 00:01:18.629
You poisoned me.

17
00:01:18.629 --> 00:01:19.629
You tried to defame me.

18
00:01:19.629 --> 00:01:21.430
You pretended to be me.

19
00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.739
You.

20
00:01:23.739 --> 00:01:38.219
I don't think I'll ever be able to forgive you.

21
00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:41.459
You know, James in an appointed boss kind of way.

22
00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:52.549
It might not have been the love you want, but it was love.

23
00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:54.870
And that's all I came here to say.

24
00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:56.319
Goodbye, sleep.

25
00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:58.659
Have a good life.

26
00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:10.610
No.

27
00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:11.610
I'm my sole favorite.

28
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:19.050
I'm my sole favorite.
