1
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:09,980
Are you okay?

2
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:14,660
I'm done with the past.

3
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:17,559
It's time to move forward.

4
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:19,559
Fully and completely.

5
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:23,519
And a future with me.

6
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,519
You still want that?

7
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,519
Well, that's up to you, isn't it?

8
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:31,160
You'd have to keep me interested.

9
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,450
Challenge accepted.

10
00:00:33,450 --> 00:01:05,239
You ready to go?

11
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:06,239
Thanks.

12
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:11,500
Thank you.

13
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,500
I really like your book.

14
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,500
You want to make fun of it?

15
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,900
Yeah, I'm so happy.

16
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:17,900
Thank you.

17
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,900
You're okay supporting any of you.

18
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:27,469
I loved your book.

19
00:01:27,469 --> 00:01:28,469
Thank you.

20
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:31,469
It's so sweet and gut-wrenching at the same time.

21
00:01:31,469 --> 00:01:38,719
What inspired the story?

22
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:40,719
It was based on a real life mistake.

23
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:43,879
The best mistake ever.
