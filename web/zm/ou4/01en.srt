1
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:16,460
Have you been waiting for me?

2
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:18,620
I've missed you so much.

3
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,539
I brought you something back.

4
00:00:20,539 --> 00:00:21,780
Did my parents invite you?

5
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:24,570
Where are they?

6
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,019
Here it is.

7
00:00:27,019 --> 00:00:30,600
Shameless.

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,280
You've been abroad for four years,

9
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,479
and the first thing you do is try to steal my man.

10
00:00:35,479 --> 00:00:37,359
You're mature, other and long.

11
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:38,520
You're a man?

12
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,590
Yes.

13
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:45,579
Your sister and Connor are engaged.

14
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:46,399
Since when?

15
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:47,299
Last month.

16
00:00:47,299 --> 00:00:48,659
And you were not invited

17
00:00:48,659 --> 00:00:51,140
because we know what you were doing behind our backs.

18
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:53,259
Connor told us everything.

19
00:00:53,259 --> 00:00:56,140
Your name has been removed from the family trust.

20
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:59,619
You've lost your rights to inherit Johnson architect.

21
00:00:59,619 --> 00:01:01,549
You may leave.

22
00:01:01,549 --> 00:01:02,390
Now.

23
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:05,340
Dad, I'm Connor.

24
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,939
I was coming to propose to you, and now this?

25
00:01:07,939 --> 00:01:09,140
Is this true?

26
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,379
Yep, it is.

27
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:11,579
Let's go.

28
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:12,579
Hands off.

29
00:01:12,579 --> 00:01:15,159
I can see myself out.

30
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:18,420
What is this?

31
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,280
Cheap shit.

32
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,159
That Connor jerk is full of shit.

33
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:24,319
I knew it.

34
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:26,590
I thought we were meant to be.

35
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:28,909
I can't believe I was going to propose to him.

36
00:01:28,909 --> 00:01:30,829
I am beyond stupid.

37
00:01:30,829 --> 00:01:34,469
Do you know what exactly he said to your parents?

38
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:35,310
No.

39
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,310
And anybody who knows what actually happened

40
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:38,790
isn't talking to me.

41
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:41,310
Well, you're welcome to stay at my place tonight.

42
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:46,540
And that will be a lining up to marry you when you're ready.

43
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:50,099
Till then, maybe you can make the most of your single life.

44
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:52,700
And make Connor pay for what he did to you

45
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,379
by getting with his super hot uncle.
