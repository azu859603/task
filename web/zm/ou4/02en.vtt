what are you talking about? Look, that's Connor's uncle. My God. He looks yummy.

2
00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:22.059
How do you know he's his uncle? I mean I was with him all throughout his school and I never met him.

3
00:00:22.059 --> 00:00:26.699
Not many people have. Apparently he manages the European division of the business. Just came back

4
00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.980
to last week. My brother met him at a cocktail party and sent me his picture. Connor's entire

5
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:38.219
family. Is that his mercy? And apparently he's very, very single.

6
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.060
Let's teach Connor a little lesson about what happens when he breaks his heart.

7
00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:51.020
Yes. Oh, okay then. All right. Go for all.

8
00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:02.850
Bramble please. Surprising. Likewise. I'm sorry. I only have one serving left.

9
00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:13.469
He's gonna take his drink at me. No. Get the jacket. Very gallant for you. Actually I'll pay

10
00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:23.230
for the gentleman's drink. No thanks. I'm actually allergic to charity. Connor's gonna be calling me

11
00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:29.790
Auntie Molly.
