00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.639
Ooh! Radiohead. I could listen to Kid Emnesia all night.

2
00:00:04.639 --> 00:00:05.679
What are you doing?

3
00:00:05.679 --> 00:00:07.879
Tending a heart, but she needs some healing.

4
00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:18.620
Good thing I'm not a doctor. Don't think I can heal you. You were just so...

5
00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:19.699
Charming.

6
00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:21.019
What's my super system?

7
00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:22.699
It's no way to talk to your girl.

8
00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:24.059
So now you're my girl.

9
00:00:24.059 --> 00:00:27.980
You know what I say when you meet the one your face muscles tremble?

10
00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.899
My face has been doing that. Look.

11
00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:34.020
I think I've had enough of your brain keep. You can go back to wherever you came from.

12
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.539
I'm not pranking you.

13
00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.380
Can I at least have your name?

14
00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.500
Your number?

15
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.259
Okay, what do you actually want from me?

16
00:00:43.259 --> 00:00:45.299
I want to marry you.

17
00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:47.700
Is this how you usually pick up guys in the bar or...?

18
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.820
My name is Molly. I'm 22 years old.

19
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.460
I recently graduated college. I make my own money. I'm really funny.

20
00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.179
I have so many jokes that I could put a smile on that stone statuesque face of yours.

21
00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:02.820
Oh, and I do push-ups every day.

22
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.060
So you'll always have a shoulder to cry on.

23
00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.939
Above all, I think I'd make the perfect wife.

24
00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:13.790
Perhaps flash bears can get me out of my struggle.

25
00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.390
You're not messing with me?

26
00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.510
Not one bit.

27
00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.829
Leave me a city all tomorrow. 10 a.m. Bring goody.
