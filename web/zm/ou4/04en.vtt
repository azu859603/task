00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:03.009
Hey, what are you doing? This is my house!

2
00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:16.129
There you are. I'm sorry, Molly, but your sister Jennifer has more equity than you,

3
00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:20.050
and I need to marry a rich heiress, or my father won't give me his company.

4
00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.129
And with my uncle back in town, he is extra stressed and pushy.

5
00:00:24.129 --> 00:00:26.050
Does Jennifer know about any of this?

6
00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.129
No, my heart is all yours. When I get my father's company,

7
00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:34.609
and Jennifer shares, we can get back together again and we can have everything.

8
00:00:34.609 --> 00:00:36.609
You drove a wedge between me and my family.

9
00:00:36.609 --> 00:00:40.450
I'm not proud of that, but I needed to make sure Jennifer got the most shares.

10
00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.289
You need to get the fuck out right now.

11
00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:42.929
Molly.

12
00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:46.609
No, Connor, I always knew all you cared about was money,

13
00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:48.929
but I didn't realize how much of a coward you are.

14
00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.350
Get out. Now.

15
00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.200
Which time is it?

16
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.000
9.40?

17
00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:03.140
Where are you going?

18
00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.379
I'm going to get married.
