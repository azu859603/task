1
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:06,400
You're here already.

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,400
I've been here for an hour.

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,400
Aw, you already missed me.

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,400
Let me be clear with you.

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,400
I'm only getting married to you,

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,400
because I'm trying to be a ranged marriage to my father.

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,399
Is that clear?

8
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:19,750
Get divorced after two months.

9
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,750
Plus, you're young. I don't want to waste your time.

10
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,750
I can decide what to do with my time.

11
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:26,010
What a good-looking couple.

12
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,010
Congrats on your marriage.

13
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:30,969
You're going to have the most beautiful kids.

14
00:00:30,969 --> 00:00:41,579
And we won't have kids.

15
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:43,579
Would you guys mind getting a little bit closer

16
00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:46,579
and maybe looking a little bit sweeter?

17
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:49,609
And, sir, if you could smile, that would be amazing.

18
00:00:49,609 --> 00:00:53,609
Oh, he has facial paralysis, so he can't really smile.

19
00:00:53,609 --> 00:00:59,609
Congratulations to the both of you.

20
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:01,609
You are now officially married.

21
00:01:01,609 --> 00:01:06,560
Why does he have a different last name than Connor's mom?

22
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,859
Your last name is Mancini.
