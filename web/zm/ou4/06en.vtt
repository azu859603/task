00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:02.750
Your last name is Mancini?

2
00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:05.750
Yeah, I took my mother's maiden name.

3
00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:11.400
All right, here's my number.

4
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.400
I'll be all worse and don't call me.

5
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.399
Wait, we're married. Shouldn't we live together now?

6
00:00:16.399 --> 00:00:18.399
No, I don't like living with anyone.

7
00:00:18.399 --> 00:00:20.399
Not anyone? I'm your wife.

8
00:00:20.399 --> 00:00:23.399
And my family despises me so I have nowhere to live.

9
00:00:23.399 --> 00:00:25.399
Okay, I'll find you in place and I'll pay for rent.

10
00:00:25.399 --> 00:00:33.579
How are you, grandma?

11
00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:34.799
You failed.

12
00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:35.799
What are you talking about?

13
00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:40.140
You're on to a city hall. Didn't you just get married?

14
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.140
Yeah, just got married.

15
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.140
Well, then I'm going to plant my miffage.

16
00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.140
What, what? You're coming?

17
00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.140
I hate grandma, it's Molly.

18
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.140
Hello there. I'm visiting Molly, not you.

19
00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.140
Wait, grandma, what are you planning to?

20
00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:01.679
All right, I guess you can't come over.

21
00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:03.679
So, otherwise, my grandma would not believe us.

22
00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:05.680
But my room is off limits, you can send the guest room.

23
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:06.680
Is that clear?

24
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:12.799
All right.

25
00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:14.799
Didn't it tell you to keep a low profile this time?

26
00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:16.799
This is our cheapest car, sir.

27
00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.799
Does anyone in this city know my real idea?
