00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.080
Mia's back. Mia's back? Who is this? Mia is a dog.

2
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.660
Yes, Mia is the dog. Who are you? A birdler?

3
00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:38.119
Hi Mia. Now that worked, I do not have time to talk.

4
00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:40.380
Will you be home for dinner without your face?

5
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.219
No, and don't call me that.

6
00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:44.679
Alright, you. Absolutely not.

7
00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:47.469
Fine, let me.

8
00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:48.469
Okay, stop it.

9
00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:49.469
Hubby.

10
00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:50.469
Okay, alright.

11
00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:53.340
Tell me those names. I'll come home for dinner.

12
00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:01.159
Okay.

13
00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:03.159
Hey Molly, how was your day?

14
00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:04.159
It was great.

15
00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:06.120
Thank you so much for asking Uncle Adrian.

16
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.879
Thank you for the surprise.

17
00:01:08.879 --> 00:01:09.879
You're a total bait.

18
00:01:09.879 --> 00:01:10.879
You're totally welcome, Adrian.

19
00:01:10.879 --> 00:01:11.879
This one is perfect.

20
00:01:11.879 --> 00:01:14.030
Hmm.
