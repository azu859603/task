Hi Mr. Grouchy face.

2
00:00:03,339 --> 00:00:07,339
When I said you could move in, I didn't mean to move everything in my house.

3
00:00:07,339 --> 00:00:10,339
Isn't this place so nice? It was so weary before.

4
00:00:10,339 --> 00:00:13,869
Now it feels like a home.

5
00:00:13,869 --> 00:00:16,260
Come on, I have something to do.

6
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:25,370
Ta-da, come sit.

7
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:30,449
I call it Sunday morning.

8
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:32,450
You named the balcony?

9
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:36,450
Imagine you've overslept in its Sunday.

10
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,450
You wake up from me as snoring.

11
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:44,450
You come out here, lounge on the couch, sip a cup of coffee, read the newspaper,

12
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:48,450
and then you stare up at the clouds, pushing that Sunday morning would never end.

13
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:52,509
Well, I think you should call it the corner where you waste your time.

14
00:00:52,509 --> 00:00:55,509
How do you call it Monday morning? So you work a little harder.

15
00:00:55,509 --> 00:00:56,509
Come on, have a little time.

16
00:00:56,509 --> 00:01:06,230
I mean, what is this couch you made of? This couch is horrible.

17
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:14,950
This is a bad idea.

18
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:17,950
This man stubborn as a mule.
