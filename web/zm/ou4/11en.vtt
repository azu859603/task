00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.440
You didn't see us the moment, Mr. Cole?

2
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:05.940
Hmm.

3
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:06.940
Maybe next time.

4
00:00:20.059 --> 00:00:21.379
You'd ride?

5
00:00:21.379 --> 00:00:22.579
No, I'm fine.

6
00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:24.000
What are you doing?

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.839
Life, you're interested?

8
00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:28.000
You're not the only one who can play cool.

9
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.239
Heartless, dear Adrienne.

10
00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:38.369
How gallant?

11
00:00:38.369 --> 00:00:44.429
I'm not in front of a D.U.C.

12
00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:45.630
Hey!

13
00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:56.140
How are we?

14
00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.270
Yeah, it's gonna break my t-shirt all hard.

15
00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:59.630
I know, I know.

16
00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.729
But we have the...

17
00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:02.689
How gallant?

18
00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:16.049
They're over quality, baby.

19
00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.739
Grandma, uh...

20
00:01:17.739 --> 00:01:20.340
What are you doing here?

21
00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.180
No, it's just, um...

22
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.879
Opening the door now.

23
00:01:28.879 --> 00:01:31.599
Can you pretend we're really close for one night, please?

24
00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:37.760
If you bag me.

25
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.409
Grandma?

26
00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:40.450
Grandma?

27
00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.620
Gotcha!

28
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:44.819
Christ, you scared me, Grandma.

29
00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:46.260
Hi, Grandma, I'm Molly.

30
00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.219
Oh!

31
00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:53.420
Isn't she a sweetheart?

32
00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.900
Oh, Adrienne, you said you married someone,

33
00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.099
but you didn't say how stunning she is.

34
00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.409
Isn't she stunning?

35
00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.000
Isn't she stunning?

36
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.900
Yeah.

37
00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.340
Yeah, it's just gorgeous.

38
00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.099
Come on in.

39
00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:15.539
Finally, Adrienne.

40
00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:18.259
I've been waiting for this for a very long time.

41
00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:20.020
I had thought you were gay.

42
00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.939
Grandma?

43
00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:25.139
Tell me, how did you propose to this gorgeous girl?

44
00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:27.219
I'm not really a romantic story, knows it, Molly.

45
00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:28.340
No, it's pretty normal.

46
00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.900
Normal.

47
00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.419
What do you mean, you've just married a girl that you love?

48
00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:35.060
You must have a good proposal story.

49
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.819
It's not like you've married a stranger you just met in a bar.

50
00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:40.129
No.

51
00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:41.090
Of course not.

52
00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:45.439
No, so what happened was I took her for dinner

53
00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:49.439
and then after dinner was dessert, we had dessert,

54
00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:53.650
and then I got down on one knee and I proposed.

55
00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:55.389
And she said yes.

56
00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:57.469
And then we went over.

57
00:02:57.469 --> 00:02:59.389
Well, if that's how you proposed to her,

58
00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:01.870
I'm surprised Molly said yes.

59
00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.210
I'm surprised Molly said yes.

60
00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:09.090
Actually, I proposed.

61
00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:11.250
You did.

62
00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.889
Yeah, it was just a regular work day

63
00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:16.930
and I decided to flip the script and take action

64
00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:20.210
because of his little marriage story.

65
00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:22.210
His tragic little story.

66
00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:27.169
So he came home from work and there was a little box on the table

67
00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:29.009
and he opened it up on purpose.

68
00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.849
But there wasn't a ring inside.

69
00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:34.050
No ring.

70
00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:39.090
There was a map which led him back to the bar where we first met.

71
00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:45.620
And he went back to the bar and I was there on one knee

72
00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:53.469
and I asked him if he'd marry me because marriage can be a beautiful thing.

73
00:03:53.469 --> 00:03:56.830
And then he leaned in and gave me a long tender.

74
00:03:58.479 --> 00:04:00.639
Well, that is a good story.

75
00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:03.439
I wish I'd been one of the drunkards at the bar.

76
00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:08.449
Would you mind reliving that scene for me?

77
00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:10.210
I want to take a photograph.

78
00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:12.770
Of what scene, grandma?

79
00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:14.210
One of the tender kiss.

80
00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:17.550
Oh, we don't really do that right?

81
00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:18.750
Right now, right?

82
00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.629
Oh, come on, keep your grandpa some joy, will you?

83
00:04:22.269 --> 00:04:24.430
Kiss the girl for the photograph.

84
00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:32.910
What's that a kiss?

85
00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.660
Kiss the girl for the photograph.

86
00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:48.579
What's that a kiss?

87
00:04:48.579 --> 00:04:49.139
Sure was.

88
00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:51.699
Great.

89
00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:53.139
Well, I'll be off then.

90
00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.660
I don't want to spoil this romantic moment.

91
00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:57.459
No, you don't.

92
00:04:58.019 --> 00:04:58.500
Good night.

93
00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:59.379
Good night, grandma.

94
00:04:59.379 --> 00:05:00.100
Good night, grandma.

95
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.500
You know, it's getting very dark.

96
00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:07.819
I think I should stay the night.

97
00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.220
Gosh, that means...

98
00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:11.259
We'll have to share a room.

99
00:05:15.339 --> 00:05:18.139
Wishful thinking, he kissed your cheek, Molly.

100
00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:19.180
You know what that means.

101
00:05:25.649 --> 00:05:26.850
You can stay there for one.

102
00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:30.240
You're bad, huh?

103
00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:32.189
Middle.

104
00:05:32.189 --> 00:05:33.230
Why would I be?

105
00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:36.670
He's a hub by the way.

106
00:05:46.769 --> 00:05:47.730
No biggie.

107
00:05:47.730 --> 00:06:00.459
My favorite color is blue.

108
00:06:01.839 --> 00:06:04.000
I'm a huge radio fan.

109
00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.639
Read my first business book when I was 10,

110
00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:08.480
while my friends were playing Zelda.

111
00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.639
So they probably thought I was a giant nerd.

112
00:06:11.709 --> 00:06:12.350
I hate plants,

113
00:06:13.069 --> 00:06:14.269
because they were mine with my mom.

114
00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:17.550
And I've never had a cinnamon roll before.

115
00:06:18.189 --> 00:06:19.550
You're missing out on so much.

116
00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:21.839
You're in dark texture?

117
00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:23.360
That's my dream.

118
00:06:25.089 --> 00:06:27.089
But my family doesn't believe in me.

119
00:06:28.079 --> 00:06:30.959
To them, I'm just some dumb girl who only cares about

120
00:06:30.959 --> 00:06:33.759
which picture she's going to post on Instagram next.

121
00:06:34.959 --> 00:06:35.839
Family.

122
00:06:35.839 --> 00:06:37.329
My feeling.

123
00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:41.089
One day I woke up and I just said to myself to help

124
00:06:41.089 --> 00:06:41.889
with their opinions.

125
00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:44.180
I'm going to be an architect.

126
00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:49.709
So you said you don't believe in marriage?

127
00:06:51.389 --> 00:06:51.629
Why?

128
00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:55.259
We change stuff.

129
00:06:56.939 --> 00:06:58.139
Do you still feel that way?

130
00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:00.980
Yes.

131
00:07:04.579 --> 00:07:08.180
Hey, thanks for making my grandma so happy today.

132
00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:09.540
I know you know how to go.

133
00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:09.779
Yeah.

134
00:07:11.329 --> 00:07:12.290
Good night.

135
00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:47.920
I've made breakfast for you.

136
00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.519
Get up here, you grandma's here.

137
00:07:49.519 --> 00:07:53.410
Did you go to make a morning?

138
00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:54.620
No, just get up here.

139
00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:55.339
No, of course not.

140
00:07:55.819 --> 00:07:56.860
Come on in, grandma.

141
00:07:58.100 --> 00:07:59.060
Come on in, grandma.

142
00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:02.100
Good morning.

143
00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:04.850
We could have made you breakfast, grandma.

144
00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:06.209
It's no problem.

145
00:08:06.209 --> 00:08:07.810
You're family now.

146
00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:11.490
I love the plants that he put in the sitting room.

147
00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:13.970
Would you like to go plant shopping with me?

148
00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:14.850
I would love that.

149
00:08:19.759 --> 00:08:22.560
Oh, that's a, um, I know.

150
00:08:23.779 --> 00:08:24.100
Yes.

151
00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:33.860
So beautiful shop.

152
00:08:35.059 --> 00:08:37.899
Just love this one.

153
00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:39.840
You should guess it.

154
00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:43.019
Ooh, great choice.

155
00:08:43.019 --> 00:08:44.139
Let me pack that up for you.

156
00:08:44.139 --> 00:08:44.940
How much is it?

157
00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:45.980
It's 90 dollars.

158
00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:49.899
Um, that's a little too pricey for me.

159
00:08:58.909 --> 00:09:00.429
Is this the plant lady wanting?

160
00:09:00.429 --> 00:09:00.750
Yes.

161
00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:02.960
Oh, I get it.

162
00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:15.019
Perfect.

163
00:09:15.019 --> 00:09:18.559
Adrian, I'm so sorry.

164
00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:20.179
Where are you?

165
00:09:22.419 --> 00:09:22.980
Adrian.

166
00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:23.940
Where's Mia?

167
00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:24.899
Uh, they brought her inside.

168
00:09:24.899 --> 00:09:25.860
They told me to wait out here.

169
00:09:26.899 --> 00:09:28.980
How could your mistake and vitamins for dog food?

170
00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:29.860
How could that happen?

171
00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:31.299
Adrian, I, I, I, I, I.

172
00:09:31.299 --> 00:09:32.100
Okay, stop, stop.

173
00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:33.779
Tell me how it happened.

174
00:09:33.779 --> 00:09:35.059
Very clearly from the beginning.

175
00:09:35.059 --> 00:09:35.379
Please.

176
00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:37.220
It was at work.

177
00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:38.820
I came home.

178
00:09:40.019 --> 00:09:40.980
I was exhausted.

179
00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:42.820
Those investors gave me a hard time.

180
00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:44.259
I wasn't paying attention.

181
00:09:44.259 --> 00:09:47.889
Went to give Mia her food and I was distracted.

182
00:09:47.889 --> 00:09:50.450
And I went to shower and I came out and she was

183
00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:51.809
lying on the floor throwing her.

184
00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:53.730
I'm so sorry, Adrian.

185
00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:55.090
I never meant to hurt her.

186
00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:59.179
I can't believe I trusted you alone with Mia.

187
00:09:59.179 --> 00:10:01.500
I can't believe it.

188
00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:05.250
I care about Mia and I'll do anything to make up that.

189
00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:06.210
Yeah, well, it's too late.

190
00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:08.610
What's that supposed to mean?

191
00:10:09.549 --> 00:10:10.509
I want you to move out.

192
00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:15.059
Adrian, please.

193
00:10:15.059 --> 00:10:15.539
I...

194
00:10:15.539 --> 00:10:16.340
Not packing things.

195
00:10:16.899 --> 00:10:18.820
Anything you'd help find in the place, I'll find you.

196
00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:19.379
Just get out.

197
00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:21.700
Adrian.

198
00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:42.289
How's she doing?

199
00:10:42.289 --> 00:10:44.049
Their dog is too weak, pregnant.

200
00:10:44.929 --> 00:10:45.330
What?

201
00:10:45.889 --> 00:10:48.049
You don't seem pleased about the news.

202
00:10:48.049 --> 00:10:49.009
Should I do something?

203
00:10:49.759 --> 00:10:50.000
No.

204
00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:54.049
Do you bring a dog to spirit?

205
00:10:54.049 --> 00:10:55.409
Sometimes, yes.

206
00:10:55.409 --> 00:10:57.409
Some people who don't know better will think that

207
00:10:57.409 --> 00:10:59.649
the dog has digestive problems.

208
00:10:59.649 --> 00:11:00.850
And the vitamins?

209
00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:02.210
Oh, the vitamins are harmless.

210
00:11:03.009 --> 00:11:03.409
All right.

211
00:11:04.129 --> 00:11:04.929
Thank you, dog.

212
00:11:04.929 --> 00:11:05.330
Of course.

213
00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:54.429
Dude, you actually look better when you're sad.

214
00:12:54.429 --> 00:12:56.029
You're not in the mood, man.

215
00:12:56.029 --> 00:12:57.149
Come on.

216
00:12:57.149 --> 00:12:58.990
Let's put a smile on that face.

217
00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:01.519
I know, I know.

218
00:13:01.519 --> 00:13:02.799
You have to get you back out there.

219
00:13:04.059 --> 00:13:05.019
You have to let loose.

220
00:13:09.519 --> 00:13:10.320
Names.

221
00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:11.200
Uh, Molly Johnson.

222
00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:12.700
Sasha Brown.

223
00:13:13.649 --> 00:13:15.889
Sorry, but your name's been banned from our guest list.

224
00:13:15.889 --> 00:13:17.779
What?

225
00:13:17.779 --> 00:13:20.100
It's by a shareholder on the board called, uh,

226
00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:20.820
Jennifer Johnson.

227
00:13:21.629 --> 00:13:23.950
I'm sure my family invested in this club.

228
00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:24.429
Let's go.

229
00:13:24.429 --> 00:13:26.269
No, no, we're not leaving.

230
00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:29.309
Listen, you're gonna let us in, boy.

231
00:13:29.309 --> 00:13:30.990
Okay, because I will call my brother.

232
00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:33.090
And he will sew your ass.

233
00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:34.129
Oh, we can let ourselves out.

234
00:13:34.129 --> 00:13:36.370
Hey, hey, hey, let go of me.

235
00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:37.250
Go over.

236
00:13:38.129 --> 00:13:39.649
Is this how you treat women?

237
00:13:39.649 --> 00:13:41.629
Fuck me.

238
00:13:41.629 --> 00:13:45.070
Go over.

239
00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:46.110
Is this how you treat women?

240
00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:47.789
Sorry, Miss Mancini.

241
00:13:47.789 --> 00:13:48.990
I'm just doing my job.

242
00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:50.029
Doing your job?

243
00:13:50.029 --> 00:13:50.909
That's you doing your job.

244
00:13:50.909 --> 00:13:52.429
You shouldn't have your job at all.

245
00:13:52.429 --> 00:13:53.870
I'm sorry, Miss Mancini.

246
00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:55.470
She's just a random girl.

247
00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:56.029
Random girl.

248
00:13:57.679 --> 00:13:58.879
This random girl's my wife.

249
00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:00.820
What?

250
00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:02.899
He does care about me.

251
00:14:02.899 --> 00:14:04.500
Mr. Harrison, you must help me.

252
00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:06.659
I don't really know these ladies and, uh,

253
00:14:06.659 --> 00:14:07.539
you can understand.

254
00:14:07.539 --> 00:14:10.100
I don't know much about her, but I have heard of Molly Johnson.

255
00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:12.539
She stands as one of the brightest

256
00:14:12.539 --> 00:14:14.460
architectural talents in the city.

257
00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:16.139
She's not just some social butterfly

258
00:14:16.139 --> 00:14:17.659
only in those parties and banquets.

259
00:14:18.379 --> 00:14:21.679
She's someone to look out for.

260
00:14:21.679 --> 00:14:22.240
Wow.

261
00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:24.080
Adrian really told him a lot about me.

262
00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:26.259
You can go, sir.

263
00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:29.389
Thank you, Mr. Harrison.

264
00:14:29.389 --> 00:14:30.350
Harrison.

265
00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:31.549
Mad Harrison.

266
00:14:31.549 --> 00:14:33.230
Just call me Madam, your husband's friend.

267
00:14:34.289 --> 00:14:36.370
Don't be mistaken by his poker face.

268
00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:38.610
He is very much obsessed with me.

269
00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:41.950
He hasn't laughed once since you moved.

270
00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:42.990
All right, that's enough.

271
00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:46.779
Shall we, uh, get out of here?

272
00:14:57.649 --> 00:14:58.289
Hey.

273
00:14:58.289 --> 00:14:58.850
Hey.

274
00:14:58.850 --> 00:15:05.570
Hey, I think I'm gonna go home.

275
00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:14.419
Molly, all right.

276
00:15:14.419 --> 00:15:15.779
If you ever wanted to move back in.

277
00:15:33.039 --> 00:15:35.070
Hello.

278
00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:37.389
Do you remember that investment you asked me about?

279
00:15:37.389 --> 00:15:39.149
Do I have good news for you?

280
00:15:39.149 --> 00:15:39.870
Tell me.

281
00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:42.909
There is a mysterious investor who is

282
00:15:42.909 --> 00:15:46.269
absolutely enamored with your architectural designs.

283
00:15:46.269 --> 00:15:50.240
They will only help you start your own architectural firm.

284
00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:51.840
This is a dream come true.

285
00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:53.600
I knew you'd be thrilled.

286
00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:55.360
I'll let you know when I confirm with them.

287
00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:56.480
Who's the investor?

288
00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:57.120
Can I meet them?

289
00:15:57.679 --> 00:15:59.679
The investor doesn't want to meet.

290
00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:00.879
Just yet.

291
00:16:01.899 --> 00:16:05.230
The moment will come when it's meant to be so yet.

292
00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:07.149
Truth, I have no idea who it is.

293
00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:08.990
Why don't they want to meet?

294
00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:11.309
I'd love to express my gratitude.

295
00:16:11.309 --> 00:16:12.750
I insisted there was no rush.

296
00:16:13.629 --> 00:16:14.669
That's mysterious.

297
00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:05.390
So you're just gonna go and knock on the door.

298
00:17:06.539 --> 00:17:07.500
Yeah, what?

299
00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:09.019
It'll be fine.

300
00:17:09.019 --> 00:17:11.490
Just for Christ's sake, smile.

301
00:17:21.329 --> 00:17:22.210
Is Molly here?

302
00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:29.920
I've got a package and I need your signature.

303
00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:30.480
Molly?

304
00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:34.960
Well, that gives your joint mixture the contents from text.

305
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:44.559
I love it.

306
00:17:46.259 --> 00:17:46.579
You do?

307
00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:48.990
Do you want to come in?

308
00:17:50.019 --> 00:17:50.259
Yeah.

309
00:17:53.869 --> 00:17:55.069
Your place is so cute.

310
00:17:56.029 --> 00:17:56.509
Thanks.

311
00:17:56.509 --> 00:17:58.430
I've been trying to redecorate it a little bit.

312
00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:11.539
The deadline for my project to seem so

313
00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:14.079
can make yourself comfortable.

314
00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:15.920
There's food and wine and bridge.

315
00:18:18.690 --> 00:18:19.250
Right.

316
00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:19.730
Yes.

317
00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:20.369
Don't mind me.

318
00:18:21.259 --> 00:18:24.559
Just sit right here.

319
00:18:31.099 --> 00:18:33.180
You know, sleeping legs for a bit of worker.

320
00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:35.339
Well, I wasn't the one who dragged

321
00:18:35.339 --> 00:18:37.660
someone into my apartment this late.

322
00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:39.500
Oh, so it's my fault.

323
00:18:41.150 --> 00:19:16.579
Does it work, meaning just...

324
00:19:16.579 --> 00:19:17.220
I'll be right back.

325
00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:19.859
Yeah, of course I will go to the meeting just one second.

326
00:19:21.099 --> 00:19:21.579
What is it?

327
00:19:23.569 --> 00:19:30.190
It's going nowhere.

328
00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:31.309
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

329
00:19:31.309 --> 00:19:32.349
You're nervous.

330
00:19:32.349 --> 00:19:33.619
I did it all down.

331
00:19:33.619 --> 00:19:35.059
Okay, please just don't call me again.

332
00:19:35.059 --> 00:19:36.019
Thank you.

333
00:19:36.019 --> 00:19:49.410
Is this the building you wanted to create?

334
00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:49.569
No.

335
00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:51.819
I mean, I'll give it my all, but...

336
00:19:52.539 --> 00:19:53.259
It's work.

337
00:19:53.819 --> 00:19:55.500
You know, not my dream.

338
00:19:56.059 --> 00:19:57.660
Well, what is your dream?

339
00:19:57.660 --> 00:20:00.819
Well, you don't know where my sketches are right now,

340
00:20:00.819 --> 00:20:02.660
but if I find them, I'll show you.

341
00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:03.700
Well, you could draw it on my face.

342
00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:05.299
Joking.

343
00:20:06.319 --> 00:20:07.200
Joking.

344
00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:08.750
Support that idea.

345
00:20:13.789 --> 00:20:15.470
In our rebuilt Sunday morning,

346
00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:18.500
I have a coffee out there every morning.

347
00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:21.200
I don't think I've ever felt so happy in my own house.

348
00:20:23.059 --> 00:20:24.019
So brilliant, I do.

349
00:20:25.059 --> 00:20:25.539
Thank you.

350
00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:28.420
My dad and my mom were so close.

351
00:20:30.059 --> 00:20:31.019
They loved me, just...

352
00:20:37.299 --> 00:20:38.660
That isn't really sort of fighting.

353
00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:41.059
Are you screaming at each other?

354
00:20:42.019 --> 00:20:44.480
Over money, of course.

355
00:20:46.799 --> 00:20:52.420
Then one day, my mom just picked up her suitcase and left.

356
00:20:53.619 --> 00:20:54.180
Adrienne?

357
00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:56.220
No, that's okay.

358
00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:57.740
That's my little tragic story.

359
00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:01.200
Now my dad is trying to get me into an arranged marriage

360
00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:03.359
for a strategic business line, so...

361
00:21:05.069 --> 00:21:07.819
I don't think I'm gonna repeat that story.

362
00:21:07.819 --> 00:21:09.579
That's why he said you don't believe in marriage.

363
00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:13.089
I guess you could say it.

364
00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:31.470
My faith has been shaggy.

365
00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:32.509
How do I feel guilty?

366
00:21:33.150 --> 00:21:34.829
What if Adrienne finds out I married him

367
00:21:34.829 --> 00:21:36.269
because he's Connor's uncle?

368
00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:38.990
It's done.

369
00:21:39.869 --> 00:21:42.900
Take a look.

370
00:21:47.539 --> 00:21:48.420
This is my dream.

371
00:21:49.059 --> 00:21:50.500
It's called Cosmic Eye.

372
00:21:51.059 --> 00:21:52.180
What do you think?

373
00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:54.819
Well, it looks like you drew a scary eye.

374
00:21:54.819 --> 00:21:57.220
It's a space-time tunnel, dummy.

375
00:21:57.220 --> 00:21:58.099
Ah, gotcha.

376
00:21:59.089 --> 00:22:01.410
Well, in that case, would you mind giving me a tour?

377
00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:01.809
Captain.

378
00:22:03.859 --> 00:22:08.339
Doors closed, now we're traveling through the space-time tunnel.

379
00:22:08.339 --> 00:22:11.140
Look at your window and you see the dazzling starlight.

380
00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:12.019
I see the starlight.

381
00:22:12.019 --> 00:22:12.980
I see the starlight.

382
00:22:13.859 --> 00:22:17.380
It looks like we have some whole other dimensions here.

383
00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:21.220
The fourth dimensionally unit designed using the Escher style.

384
00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:22.660
Wow, look at all that callous nebulae.

385
00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:24.019
It looks like twinkling eyes.

386
00:22:29.059 --> 00:22:31.019
Well, it's a beautiful body.

387
00:22:31.019 --> 00:22:37.180
Look, I know you need space to build your career, but if you want to move back,

388
00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:38.220
the doors are always open.

389
00:22:40.099 --> 00:22:43.839
Yeah, I have to get my ducks in the room.

390
00:22:43.839 --> 00:22:45.390
Yeah, of course.

391
00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:46.029
Not my way.

392
00:23:05.759 --> 00:23:06.960
The Johnson.

393
00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:09.359
Your slot is right at the Johnson's architect.

394
00:23:09.359 --> 00:23:10.720
What a coincidence.

395
00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:12.000
Hello, everyone.

396
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:18.259
That's my design.
