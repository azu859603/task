00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,580
Hey! That's my design! I've been working on those ideas for over a month!

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:06,379
How did you get your hands on that?

3
00:00:06,379 --> 00:00:10,080
Excuse me, would you mind be quiet, please? We want to see this.

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,380
This is the fourth dimensional world that I designed.

5
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:18,039
It's a mysterious and undiscovered world.

6
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:21,039
This is an undesiner from Johnson, pretty impressive.

7
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,239
She certainly has a bright future ahead of her.

8
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:26,679
Bullshit! She's a thief!

9
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:28,679
This is my cosmic eye.

10
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:31,679
Are you going to mention the academic research areas

11
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,179
or the artistic spaces built using new technologies,

12
00:00:35,179 --> 00:00:38,679
such as photoelectric current walls and new LED lights systems?

13
00:00:38,679 --> 00:00:41,679
And how do you know all the details about my concepts?
