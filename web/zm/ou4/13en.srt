1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,160
And how do you know all the details about my concept?

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:06,240
Because this is my design. You're a thief.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,880
How could she say that? I have been working on this project for nearly a month.

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,880
You stole every single detail from me.

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,399
Is this what companies like Johnson D.U.G. to get to the top of the industry?

6
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:18,320
Steel other people's work?

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,120
Are you accusing her of stealing your concept?

8
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,440
Yes. Every single detail.

9
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,579
Luckily, I have my laptop.

10
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:31,379
I have my rough sketches, my 2D sketches, and my 3D models all right here.

11
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:33,380
Well, show me.
