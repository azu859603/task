00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:05.860
You are as conniving as ever.

2
00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:07.860
What are you talking about, Molly?

3
00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.980
I am so sorry, everyone, for my sister.

4
00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.980
She's been having some personal issues lately.

5
00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.980
She hasn't really been herself.

6
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.539
Well, where's the proof?

7
00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:36.439
I don't have the proof with me.

8
00:00:36.439 --> 00:00:39.240
Molly, thanks a lot.

9
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.240
You're designed to earn me the right to the project.

10
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.240
You really are talented.

11
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.240
You know, you're going to Ron Hill.

12
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.240
You know, in our competition,

13
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.240
you should really do everything that you can to win.

14
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.500
Don't get too upset, sis.

15
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.979
The project would have been mine without your design.

16
00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:58.979
Connor already pulled the strings on that one.

17
00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:00.979
You really missed a good one there.
