00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I told you to ensure a fair bidding, didn't I?

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.250
I told the meeting organizer to carry out the competition in a fair manner.

3
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.250
Perhaps they assumed I allowed Molly's small company

4
00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.250
to participate in the bidding just to gain popularity.

5
00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.339
He wasn't aware of my intention to take care of Molly.

6
00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:21.339
So that's why they eliminated Molly's bidding.

7
00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:26.140
Call the organizers to funnel what happened.

8
00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:33.170
Sure. Oh, God.

9
00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.170
It's Molly.

10
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.659
Where's this?

11
00:00:37.659 --> 00:00:40.659
Looks like some abandoned area. Can you track the phone?

12
00:00:40.659 --> 00:00:41.659
Sit that part of me now.

13
00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:43.659
Hey, call the police.
