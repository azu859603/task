00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.099
Adrian, there's something I need to tell you.

2
00:00:04.099 --> 00:00:05.650
What is that?

3
00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:10.320
Come on, Molly. If you care about him, you have to be honest with him.

4
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.320
You have to tell him about marrying him because he was Connor's uncle.

5
00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:15.320
I lied to you.

6
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.100
What do you mean?

7
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.460
I married you for different reasons.

8
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:46.280
Okay, well, the reasons. It's okay. It doesn't matter.

9
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.280
I mean, I married you for different reasons too, right?

10
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.009
How will we just let polygons be polygons?

11
00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:56.490
I don't care why you married me.

12
00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.509
Let's just be in the present.

13
00:00:59.509 --> 00:01:19.530
What are you doing this weekend?

14
00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.530
I have a meeting with a new client.

15
00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.579
Nothing else. What do you ask?

16
00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:28.579
Well, it's Matt's grandfather's 80th birthday.

17
00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:33.609
And I was wondering if you'd be my plus one.

18
00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:37.609
Well, it depends. How would you introduce me to your family and friends?
