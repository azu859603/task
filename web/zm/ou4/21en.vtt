00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
How would you introduce me to your family and friends?

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.730
As my...

3
00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:08.730
What?

4
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:09.730
Life.

5
00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.730
Why do I sense a bit of uncertainty there?

6
00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:15.730
Yeah, well, as my wife.

7
00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.179
Well, that's music to my ears.

8
00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:20.500
I want to hear more.

9
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.500
Well, you didn't see us a moment, so...

10
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.809
I guess you have to wait till tomorrow.

11
00:00:26.809 --> 00:00:38.030
I'll be your plus one.

12
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.030
Mr. Lowe?

13
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.030
Yes, you must be the architect.

14
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.100
You're a lot younger than I expected.

15
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.320
Uh, well, here's my card.

16
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.979
Molly Johnson, that name rings a bell.

17
00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:54.979
Well, your surname rings a bell too.

18
00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:57.079
Care to share how?

19
00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:01.079
Not many good memories, but I do believe you're nothing like the Lowe I know.

20
00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.079
Why does he have the same last name as Connor and I've never heard of him?

21
00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:07.269
Is there a connection between him and Connor?

22
00:01:07.269 --> 00:01:09.269
Well, it is a common name.

23
00:01:09.269 --> 00:01:15.489
Well, Mr. Lowe, would you like to share some of your ideas for the villa before we take a tour?

24
00:01:15.489 --> 00:01:16.489
Sure.

25
00:01:16.489 --> 00:01:22.489
I want a classical vibe, but I also want a gym movie theater basketball court

26
00:01:22.489 --> 00:01:25.489
indoor swimming pool to start with.

27
00:01:25.489 --> 00:01:30.489
Okay, well, why don't we walk around and then I can make you some sketches?

28
00:01:30.489 --> 00:01:31.840
Okay.
