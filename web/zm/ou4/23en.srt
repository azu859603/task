00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:07,000
Uncle Paul, planning on doing some renovations to your villa soon?

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
When are you gonna have time to do all that with your busy schedule?

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Johnson Architects, they should take care of that for you.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Jennifer is a great designer.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
You should give her a chance.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I know a thing or two about the Johnson designers.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
All right, their style, it is luxurious, but their taste.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
It's just, it's too traditional and reserved for my taste.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
That's where there's room for communication.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
You can express your desires to Jennifer.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,030
Their reputation has taken a bit of a hit.

12
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,350
Could you please help them out?

13
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:43,380
Would you do this for me?

14
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:46,380
I've met with Jennifer before, and honestly, she lacks the experience.

15
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,380
And you know what?

16
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,380
She knows nothing of today's technology.

17
00:00:49,380 --> 00:01:07,359
Latest materials, high-tech appliances, it's...

18
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:09,359
I'm outside the car. You come out now.

19
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:10,359
Oh, it's a matter.

20
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:12,359
Your lips feel lonely without me around.

21
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:15,359
I already regret being a part of this conversation.

22
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:16,359
Oh, my gosh.

23
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:18,359
Want a speaker phone?

24
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:19,359
Yep.
