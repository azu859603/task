1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,980
You need to go make amends.

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:03,020
I'm sorry?

3
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:04,620
Don't you play coy with me?

4
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,769
I'm busy building my own career.

5
00:00:08,769 --> 00:00:10,929
I don't have time for your petty little show.

6
00:00:10,929 --> 00:00:12,689
What? Having regrets?

7
00:00:12,689 --> 00:00:15,089
You know, if you were still the way you used to be,

8
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:17,410
maybe I could have helped you out too.

9
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:20,420
Your words don't mean anything to me.

10
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,100
Your manners are horrific.

11
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,339
Why don't you ask your father to make you the heir

12
00:00:24,339 --> 00:00:26,019
and see how he responds?

13
00:00:26,019 --> 00:00:27,620
How of your mind?

14
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:30,100
No wonder your parents disowned you.

15
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,859
You deserve it.

16
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:33,939
Connor, do you ever listen to yourself?

17
00:00:33,939 --> 00:00:37,060
Your presence is nothing but a constant nuisance

18
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:38,259
to the Johnson family.

19
00:00:38,259 --> 00:00:41,619
Do you even realize that because of your accusations,

20
00:00:41,619 --> 00:00:45,380
Johnson's reputation has been tarnished overnight.

21
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:50,259
The company's market value has dropped two billion dollars.

22
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:53,060
It is all your fault.

23
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:55,460
It'd be my fault if I didn't tell the truth.

24
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:58,740
You stole Jennifer's work and her reputation.

25
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:01,619
What kind of person could be so mean

26
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:03,700
to her own family?

27
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,260
You told my father that I was talking shit

28
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:07,700
about my family to reporters.

29
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,980
What kind of person tears apart another's family?
