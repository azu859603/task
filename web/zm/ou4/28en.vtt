00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.429
The real misfortune is that I ever fell in love with you.

2
00:00:04.429 --> 00:00:06.730
Don't walk away.

3
00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:11.230
It is your responsibility to fix this.

4
00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:15.130
You need to repair the reputation of the Johnson family.

5
00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:18.230
I can't wait for Johnson to go bankrupt.

6
00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.230
Now get out of my way.

7
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.530
Who are you just talking to?

8
00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:27.100
Your girl said she's been thinking about me,

9
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.600
and I told her she should be a little more respectful

10
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.799
of her relationship with you.

11
00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:34.299
Shameful.

12
00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:35.799
He's bullshitting, Adrienne.

13
00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:36.799
I can wear him.

14
00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:38.619
Is this true, Molly?

15
00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:40.619
You were talking to Connor about that?

16
00:00:40.619 --> 00:00:42.869
You don't trust me?

17
00:00:42.869 --> 00:00:45.030
I wouldn't if I were you.

18
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.390
Shut up, Connor.

19
00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:51.390
Come with me, Molly.

20
00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.390
I'd like to have a word.

21
00:00:52.390 --> 00:01:00.979
You can trust me, okay?
