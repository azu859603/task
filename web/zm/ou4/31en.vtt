1
00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:59.979
Oh, Molly, I want to introduce you to my nephew Connor.

2
00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:01.820
Your Connor's uncle?

3
00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.219
Yeah, Connor and I are family.

4
00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:08.659
It would seem that fate has a way of intertwining our lives.

5
00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:10.049
Who are you?

6
00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.049
You're not his?

7
00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:14.530
Who am I?

8
00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.069
Oh, my gosh.

9
00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:18.590
I got it.

10
00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:19.590
You!

11
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.189
You're playing to marry my uncle to get back at me.

12
00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:31.620
But you mistook Adrian for him.

13
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:32.819
But that it.

14
00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:38.780
Did you marry me?

15
00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.180
One of the false assumptions that was Connor's uncle?

16
00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:42.780
Please tell me that's not true.

17
00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.780
You know what, Matt? Just upon your game?

18
00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.180
Huh? A tool for your vengeance?

19
00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.180
Adrian, I didn't mean for it to go like this, okay?

20
00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.980
I thought that...

21
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.870
You thought you could use me to get to him, right?

22
00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:55.540
You lied to me, Molly.

23
00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.140
Well, we have some other guests to attend to.

24
00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.260
Enjoy the rest of your evening.

25
00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:03.859
Adrian, I'm sorry, okay?

26
00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:04.859
It was a mistake.

27
00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:08.419
It was a lie.

28
00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:09.419
Who's the lie?

29
00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:13.020
I trusted you.

30
00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.180
I don't...

31
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.180
I don't know.

32
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.340
We can move forward from this.

33
00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.340
Adrian.

34
00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.340
Adrian!

35
00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:19.460
Adrian!

36
00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:20.460
Adrian!

37
00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:21.460
Adrian!

38
00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:22.460
I love you!

39
00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.169
And I never meant to hurt you.

40
00:02:25.169 --> 00:02:28.780
But please, give me another chance.

41
00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.379
Molly, love isn't built on lies in revenge, okay?

42
00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:37.819
I thought we had was real, but...

43
00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:39.819
How much does it believe anything you say to me?

44
00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:41.939
Hmm?

45
00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:45.639
Adrian, I know I lied to you.

46
00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:47.250
I love you.

47
00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.250
If you're giving me a chance, I promise I'll make it up to you for the rest of my life.

48
00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:52.250
I promise.

49
00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.310
You don't have to do that.

50
00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:04.500
I think I need some space.

51
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:05.500
Respect your decision.

52
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:11.669
I'll give you this space you need.

53
00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:13.669
Why don't we just get a divorce?

54
00:03:13.669 --> 00:03:18.599
We said we'd get a divorce after a few months anyway.

55
00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:20.300
Right.

56
00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.300
Yeah, no, that's...

57
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.879
I think that's for the rest.

58
00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:35.800
I'll drop the divorce papers.

59
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.800
The votes have been counted in.

60
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:43.800
We have ushered in the final competition for the final winning design for the New City Art Museum.

61
00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:50.800
And it'll be between Jennifer Johnson from Johnson Architects or Molly Johnson from CC Studio.

62
00:03:50.800 --> 00:04:00.520
Now, please, everyone, let's take a break and let's come back in 20 minutes for our final presentation.

63
00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.729
You're gonna get it, Molly.

64
00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:05.729
Thank you.

65
00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:07.729
Every single moment has led up to this.

66
00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:12.729
I have trouble checked every single detail to ensure it's security, so no one can steal this time.

67
00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:28.180
That's embarrassing.

68
00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:34.879
She has no chance.

69
00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:37.879
Heard Jennifer Johnson was a talented one.

70
00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:38.879
Dr. Addison's coming.

71
00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:42.879
She's a top ring professor at Princeton University in Architecture.

72
00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:45.579
Molly, isn't it?

73
00:04:45.579 --> 00:04:47.579
I couldn't help but notice your distress.

74
00:04:47.579 --> 00:04:50.579
Is there anything I can do to assist?

75
00:04:50.579 --> 00:04:53.579
Dr. Addison, I can't believe it's you.

76
00:04:53.579 --> 00:04:59.259
My model is damaged, and don't have any glue to fix it.

77
00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:00.259
Don't worry, Molly.

78
00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:03.319
I have it with me.

79
00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:04.319
Wow.

80
00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:05.319
Work, work.

81
00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:06.350
Thank you.

82
00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:08.350
You have no idea how much this means to me.

83
00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:29.610
Done.

84
00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.860
I can't tell you how much I appreciate this.

85
00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:37.860
Well, your design deserves to be presented in all its glory.

86
00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.860
This is remarkable.

87
00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:46.860
It reflects ingenuity, elegance, and a deep understanding for architectural concepts.

88
00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.860
I'm truly impressed.

89
00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:52.149
You have no idea how much your work's meant to me.

90
00:05:52.149 --> 00:05:56.180
I know the competition is tough, but I really do believe in my design.

91
00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:59.600
Molly, I see immense potential in you.

92
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:04.600
I would be willing to personally recommend your work to the committee.

93
00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:09.600
Your talent deserves recognition and opportunities to flourish.

94
00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.600
I can't believe what I just heard.

95
00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.600
I wish you could praise me like that.

96
00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.600
I don't know what to say.

97
00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:17.600
Thank you.

98
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:18.600
Thank you so much.

99
00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:19.600
Now go on.

100
00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:23.680
The stage is yours.

101
00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:24.680
Good evening.

102
00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.680
Thank you all for being here tonight.

103
00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:32.680
My name is Molly Johnson, and I will be presenting my project entitled Cosmic Eye.

104
00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:45.879
Thank you all for coming here tonight.

105
00:06:45.879 --> 00:06:47.879
I hope you have a good evening.

106
00:06:47.879 --> 00:06:58.709
I don't know what I would have done without you.

107
00:06:58.709 --> 00:07:01.709
Actually, there's another person you should thank.

108
00:07:01.709 --> 00:07:06.709
Molly, it's the mysterious investor who actually backed her architectural firm.

109
00:07:06.709 --> 00:07:11.709
Truth be told, I didn't choose to support you because of him.

110
00:07:11.709 --> 00:07:13.709
It's because you impressed me.

111
00:07:13.709 --> 00:07:16.709
Who is this mysterious investor?

112
00:07:16.709 --> 00:07:30.399
I'm afraid I can't tell you, Molly.

113
00:07:30.399 --> 00:07:33.620
Grandma, I was just passing by.

114
00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:36.620
Can I grab a coffee or something? I'm punched.

115
00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:38.620
Yeah, sure. Come on in.

116
00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:40.300
Milk.

117
00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:42.300
Oh yes, please. Milk.

118
00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:45.300
Two sugars. Hot, but not too hot.

119
00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:53.730
What are you looking for?

120
00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:54.730
Oh, nothing.

121
00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:56.730
I'm just stretching my legs.

122
00:07:56.730 --> 00:08:21.990
Where are you going, Grandma?

123
00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:24.990
Oh, I forgot my most favorite chocolate.

124
00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:30.029
You can't be.

125
00:08:30.029 --> 00:08:33.029
You enjoy it on the balcony. I'm heading out.

126
00:08:33.029 --> 00:09:06.029
Here's to our rising architectural star, Molly.

127
00:09:06.029 --> 00:09:07.029
Cheers.

128
00:09:11.009 --> 00:09:12.009
So?

129
00:09:12.009 --> 00:09:14.159
Oops.

130
00:09:14.159 --> 00:09:17.090
You mean about Adrian?

131
00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:19.370
No.

132
00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:20.370
He's over me.

133
00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:24.870
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have brought him up.

134
00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:26.700
Don't worry about it.

135
00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:28.700
I need to get over him.

136
00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:33.960
Speak of the devil.

137
00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:37.200
That's all right.

138
00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:42.360
I want to see you.

139
00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:43.360
Really?

140
00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:44.809
Yes.

141
00:09:44.809 --> 00:09:45.809
Come to my bedhouse in my way.

142
00:09:45.809 --> 00:09:48.059
Well, I'm not sure.

143
00:09:48.059 --> 00:09:50.289
I might be too busy.

144
00:09:50.289 --> 00:09:54.559
Because he wants to see me.

145
00:09:54.559 --> 00:09:56.779
Let's go.

146
00:09:56.779 --> 00:09:58.779
I'm going to need a lot more of this.

147
00:09:58.779 --> 00:10:00.779
Oh, yes, you are.

148
00:10:00.779 --> 00:10:06.340
I'm turning this to you.

149
00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:08.779
The houseplants?

150
00:10:08.779 --> 00:10:09.980
No.

151
00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:10.980
Well, yours.

152
00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:16.149
Adrian, you don't have to say goodbye like this.

153
00:10:16.149 --> 00:10:17.149
Goodbye.

154
00:10:17.149 --> 00:10:19.149
No, I don't want to say goodbye out.

155
00:10:19.149 --> 00:10:22.110
I want you to come back.

156
00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:26.710
Oh, my God. Adrian.

157
00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:33.820
This is supposed to be a surprise, but clearly I suck at surprises.

158
00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:39.879
But if you come back to me and draw a cosmic eyes on my face in your day,

159
00:10:39.879 --> 00:10:42.879
then more probably we can build it in our life.

160
00:10:42.879 --> 00:10:44.879
That would cost a billion dollars.

161
00:10:44.879 --> 00:10:49.259
Well, this isn't the first time I've invested in this rising architect.

162
00:10:49.259 --> 00:10:54.759
Adrian, are you the investor?

163
00:10:54.759 --> 00:10:58.789
Well, this isn't the first time I've invested in this rising architect.

164
00:10:58.789 --> 00:11:02.210
Adrian, are you the investor?

165
00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:03.210
Yeah.

166
00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:09.370
Just me and the old town.

167
00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:10.429
The least.

168
00:11:10.429 --> 00:11:12.429
One or three times every week.

169
00:11:12.429 --> 00:11:13.429
Orchids.

170
00:11:13.429 --> 00:11:15.429
What a once a day.

171
00:11:15.429 --> 00:11:17.460
With an ice cube.

172
00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:19.460
And big hydrangeas.

173
00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:22.840
Keep them out of the sun.

174
00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:24.899
I'm very impressed.

175
00:11:24.899 --> 00:11:26.899
I want them to flourish when you come back.

176
00:11:26.899 --> 00:11:30.659
Molly.

177
00:11:30.659 --> 00:11:41.220
Again?

178
00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:42.220
Yes.

179
00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:44.220
Yes, please.

180
00:11:44.220 --> 00:12:02.220
Adrian, kiss the girl like you mean it this time.

181
00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:16.960
Adrian, come on, we're going out.

182
00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:24.059
Adrian, you've been out here for hours.

183
00:12:24.059 --> 00:12:26.860
Sunday morning.
