00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.670
Ms. Bailey, why are you still here? You were to leave 20 minutes ago.

2
00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:26.510
Please. My boyfriend can't stop treatment. He'll die.

3
00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:32.509
We are a private healthcare institution. I have rules I must follow. No pain or stay. It's time to leave.

4
00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:43.100
Why is the last patient still here? The next one's already on their way up. Please, Doctor. He was going to wake up. I know it.

5
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:55.229
Look, I already told you. There's no hope. He's been a vegetable in a coma for three years now. I'm sorry. It's time to face facts.

6
00:00:55.229 --> 00:01:09.209
Let's go, Leo. We'll find a way.

7
00:01:09.209 --> 00:01:19.590
Ms. Bailey, wait. Please. I know things have been rough. There is hope for him. You can apply for a medical charity program here at Thorne Group.

8
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:26.590
The medical charity program? Yes. Just tell them everything you've been through with him and see what they can do.

9
00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:35.230
If you persuade them hard enough, they can help you. I promise you. Thank you. Thank you, Doctor. I'll do that right now.

10
00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:47.659
Of course. And good luck. You'll wake up, Leo. I promise.
