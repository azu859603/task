My dear Zavina, you work so hard every day in my shop, while also caring for your boyfriend.

2
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.340
Your dedication and love is truly touching.

3
00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.869
Thank you, Ms. Lizzie.

4
00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:39.490
Please consider this as a bonus for the month.

5
00:00:39.490 --> 00:01:01.799
Ms. Lizzie, I can please take it.

6
00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:04.980
People support us.

7
00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:22.519
You are going to wake up, I know it.

8
00:01:22.519 --> 00:01:28.609
Hey Daniel.

9
00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:34.489
I told you that you couldn't afford Leo's treatment, don't keep throwing your life away.

10
00:01:34.489 --> 00:01:37.900
Let him go.

11
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.170
I won't give up on Leo.

12
00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.129
I just applied today for the Thorne Group Medical Charity Program.

13
00:01:45.129 --> 00:01:47.480
Leo's going to wake up.

14
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.400
I feel it in my heart.

15
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:55.560
Chances aren't for nobody's like us.

16
00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.560
Whatever.

17
00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.459
I don't care, I'll keep trying.

18
00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:02.019
Leo is the love of my life, Daniel.

19
00:02:02.019 --> 00:02:10.740
I can't give up on him.

20
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:11.830
Daniel?

21
00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.830
I won't chew that and go.

22
00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.550
Will you continue his treatment even if it means not coming back home again, not seeing

23
00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.250
Mom or Dad?

24
00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.500
I owe Mom and Dad an apology.

25
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.159
They had high expectations for my future.

26
00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:30.349
I let them down.

27
00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:32.069
But Leo's the love of my life, Daniel.

28
00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.729
I can't just lose him.

29
00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:41.620
We are very worried about you.

30
00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.620
What's this?
