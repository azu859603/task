00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:08,189
What's this? This is dad's life savings. All of it. He told me that if you can't

2
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:19,609
let him go, then we have to help you, your family. Are you serious? Very serious.

3
00:00:19,609 --> 00:00:38,969
I'm a dad who's hosting a fundraiser for Leo. Come home. We miss you. That's amazing.

4
00:00:38,969 --> 00:01:11,200
I'll come home right away and let you down. I appreciate you. You're still doing this for me.

5
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:20,510
I love you. I've got to make this so guilty. My sweet Athena. How are you? Don't feel guilty.

6
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:26,510
You've already worked too hard to challenge a deep love and commitment to Leo. How can we possibly ignore you?

7
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:31,510
Oh my precious angel. Don't say that. We're a family.

8
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:37,200
They're actually came back. She's nothing but a beggar.

9
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:43,200
Nina. She's a member of our family and she's going through a tough time. But we should be there for her.

10
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:49,549
Oh, dang yo, stop it. We're about to get married. You don't have the money to waste on others. Save the pity.

11
00:01:49,549 --> 00:01:57,819
Don't cry my daughter. Kevin and the others will be here soon. We'll be able to eat crazy before money.

12
00:01:57,819 --> 00:02:12,800
Jesus, what is this? Like some kind of homeless shelter? Ugh. Smells as bad as old Mrs. Brown's famous liver recipe.
