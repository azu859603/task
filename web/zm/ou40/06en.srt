00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,279
Kevin, you're here. How wonderful. The fundraiser will start soon.

2
00:00:04,429 --> 00:00:07,790
Would you mind? Could you please keep your distance from us?

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:15,820
For nonsense, but since we are here, of course, we will donate something for our dear Port Leo.

4
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:18,300
Dad, they're donating. How kind of fun.

5
00:00:18,859 --> 00:00:23,019
Kevin's real estate business is really flourish, leaving his family quite wealthy.

6
00:00:23,019 --> 00:00:25,100
That could significantly boost the donation.

7
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:29,489
There's a quarter with that vegetable, Leo.

8
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:35,619
Kevin, they actually think we were here to donate for them.

9
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:41,060
Quite so, isn't it? Poor fools. But nobody came here except for us.

10
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:42,740
Kevin, you're not here to donate.

11
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:46,899
For that pathetic vegetable in a wheelchair? No.

12
00:00:47,619 --> 00:00:51,219
Only fools like you could think I'll stand one day and be your hero.

13
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:54,579
You don't have to donate, but please don't insult Leo.

14
00:00:54,579 --> 00:00:59,219
Dabina, dear. You shouldn't waste your time with that rotting vegetable.

15
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:02,420
Here's a handsome young man waiting for you.

16
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:08,450
If you were clever, you would get rid of that wheelchair nightmare.

17
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:13,760
And run after the wealthy tree. How can you even think like that?
