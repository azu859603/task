00:00:01,139 --> 00:00:08,220
Yeah, this is a lovely young lady I saw at the coffee shop the other day. I haven't stopped thinking about you since

2
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:11,099
Joseph, is it?

3
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:15,339
Thank you for the compliment, but as you can see I have a boyfriend.

4
00:00:15,339 --> 00:00:21,260
Devina, my new manners, Joseph's father, is the deputy manager for the storm group of Memphis.

5
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:25,899
Why, Joseph himself is ahead of an apartment. You show him some damn respect.

6
00:00:25,899 --> 00:00:30,460
That's right. Having Joseph's attention is an honor.

7
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:39,829
Wisely, I have no one's plaything, and I'm not just gonna go off with the highest bidder. What an idiot!

8
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:45,030
What? It means the truth. What she said is both funny and immature?

9
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:51,659
Devina, you are dumber than you look. Did I hear you apply for the Thorne Medical Charity Program?

10
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:57,020
Let me be the first to say here. You're not gonna get the result you want. Yeah?

11
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,560
What do you want? I want you to come with me, and I'll help you with your little application.

12
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,680
Otherwise, say goodbye to this veggie on wheels.

13
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:13,000
What gives you the right to mess with matters of life and death?

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,799
Because I get what I want, and what I want is for you to come with me.

15
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:22,920
Now, no!
