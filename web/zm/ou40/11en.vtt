1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:07.900
Do you have any idea what you're saying?

2
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.300
We were all over.

3
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.300
Kill me.

4
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.300
Are you off your meds?

5
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.420
You really think working for the thorn group is that impressive.

6
00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.339
My background is way more impressive than that.

7
00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:22.339
Yeah.

8
00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:23.339
You piece of shit.

9
00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:26.539
Like the thorn group would have anything to do with trash like you.

10
00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:31.140
I'm going to count to three if you don't get your little ass over here and kneel in

11
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.820
front of me and Divina and apologize.

12
00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.619
I'll send you to hell.

13
00:00:35.619 --> 00:00:40.619
Three.

14
00:00:40.619 --> 00:00:42.579
So you can't talk to me.

15
00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:44.619
You can't talk to me like that.

16
00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:48.890
You piece of shit.

17
00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.450
Guys, gifts are ready.

18
00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:51.450
Good.

19
00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.289
Mr. Leo is back.

20
00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:57.329
He met an angelic girl who took care of him all these years.

21
00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.049
Let's go welcome them back.

22
00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:15.780
Ma'am, Jack Dyson has already gone to welcome Leo.

23
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.180
It'll take about an hour to get to his address.

24
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.140
I'll tell the driver to take the thorn express highway.

25
00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.739
I need to be there in 30 minutes.

26
00:01:22.739 --> 00:01:23.739
Jack Ma'am.

27
00:01:23.739 --> 00:01:35.120
Homie, you still got some fight left, huh?

28
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.120
Fuck it.

29
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.120
I got no use for you.

30
00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:44.260
Wait!

31
00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:45.260
Look, we're such an idiot.

32
00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:46.260
It's an honor to be with Mr. Jokesa.

33
00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
Why do you have to bring everyone down for your useless boyfriend?

34
00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:50.260
Go with Mr. Jokesa.

35
00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:51.260
No!

36
00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.450
But go with me again.

37
00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:54.450
Is it me?

38
00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.450
This is him?

39
00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.930
This dead dog over me?

40
00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.370
I'm going to take your girl right in front of you.

41
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:02.400
What?

42
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.200
No, he won't touch me.

43
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.200
Listen up, shitface.

44
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.780
Touch her again and you'll regret everything.

45
00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.419
Who the fuck do you think you are?

46
00:02:11.419 --> 00:02:14.500
My father is the manager at the thorn group.

47
00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.539
You're going to wish you were still in that coma.

48
00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:18.020
I'm your deputy manager.

49
00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.409
You think that's impressive?

50
00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:26.669
What I think is you keep talking shit and you're going to find my foot up your ass.

51
00:02:26.669 --> 00:02:30.669
Kiss my ass to fucking arrogant freak.

52
00:02:30.669 --> 00:02:31.669
Say it again.

53
00:02:31.669 --> 00:02:32.669
Say it again!

54
00:02:32.669 --> 00:02:53.539
You cripple after I take your girl and blow your fucking head off.

55
00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:55.550
Whose head are you planning to blow off?

56
00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:01.090
Head of the Memphis stone group.

57
00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:06.039
I can't believe I'm seeing him in person.

58
00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:09.210
It's the ear.

59
00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:10.210
Jack Dyson?

60
00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:11.240
Mm-hmm.

61
00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.400
Mr. Jack, can I have your number?

62
00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.689
No.

63
00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:18.020
Mr. Dyson.

64
00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:21.819
A lot of time no see, but it's the occasion.

65
00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:23.870
Mom?

66
00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.870
Dad, what are you doing here?

67
00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.990
Well, we came with Mr. Dyson to welcome the heir of the thorn group.

68
00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.990
Why you here?

69
00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:32.990
The heir of the thorn group.

70
00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.990
There's no pawns here.

71
00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:38.889
This is just with these, these and this broke back loser in the chair.

72
00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:41.620
Ugh.

73
00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:42.620
Mr. Leo.

74
00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.439
Sir, you know him?

75
00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:47.439
He does not deserve your attention.

76
00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:48.439
Respect me.

77
00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:49.439
Shut up, Joseph.

78
00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:52.439
I did not expect you to get in such trouble.

79
00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:58.750
Oh, girl.

80
00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:04.530
I'm in trouble.

81
00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:05.530
Ma'am, sir.

82
00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.979
I am very sorry.

83
00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:14.900
Sir, why are you bowing to him?

84
00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:15.900
Mr. Dyson.

85
00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:16.899
Bailies are all fools.

86
00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:17.899
That man in the wheelchair.

87
00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:20.899
There's nothing but a crippled beggar with only a quarter to his name.

88
00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:22.899
You must have the wrong person.

89
00:04:22.899 --> 00:04:25.100
Yeah, he's right, boss.

90
00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.100
These nasty people don't deserve your respect.

91
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.100
If they're nasty people, what does that make you?

92
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.250
A dirty piece of shit?

93
00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:38.100
Boss?

94
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:44.100
As general manager of the Memphis thorn group, I offer my sincerest blessings to Mr. Leo.

95
00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.290
The esteemed heir of the thorn group.

96
00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.639
Welcome home, Mr. Leo.

97
00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:51.639
Welcome home, Mr. Leo.

98
00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:58.839
Kevin, did I hear that right?

99
00:04:58.839 --> 00:05:01.839
That's the heir in the thorn group.

100
00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:03.839
There's no ripple, Leo.

101
00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:06.220
Him?

102
00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:07.220
I'm having a nightmare.

103
00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:08.220
This?

104
00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.350
The heir in the thorn group?

105
00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:11.350
This guy?

106
00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:12.350
Shut up, Joseph.

107
00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:15.350
You have seriously messed up.

108
00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:17.350
No, no.

109
00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:22.449
No way.

110
00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:26.449
Mr. Vina, I am such an idiot for declining your application.

111
00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:30.449
I feel ashamed of my arrogance and foolish ignorance.

112
00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:32.769
Please forgive me.

113
00:05:32.769 --> 00:05:37.459
I'm not sure I understand what's actually going on.

114
00:05:37.459 --> 00:05:38.459
Leo, are you?

115
00:05:38.459 --> 00:05:41.930
The heir?

116
00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:46.930
And I know I should have told you sooner, but I just didn't want to scare you away.

117
00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.120
This is crazy.

118
00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.120
Leo, Dabina has done so much for you.

119
00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.860
You have to cherish her.

120
00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:58.689
Of course, Daniel and Bill, you have my work.

121
00:05:58.689 --> 00:06:00.689
And you and the important.

122
00:06:00.689 --> 00:06:03.689
And everyone here who has helped take care of me.

123
00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:08.689
I will make sure that your lives are easy and that you have everything that you want in the world.

124
00:06:08.689 --> 00:06:09.689
Especially.

125
00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:16.290
Now, Jack, I don't imagine you came here empty-handed.

126
00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:18.639
Show them the gifts.

127
00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:19.639
Yes, sir.

128
00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:34.019
A gold mine in South Africa with gold reserves of 2 million ounces.

129
00:06:34.019 --> 00:06:36.019
The value of assessment?

130
00:06:36.019 --> 00:06:38.019
Over 5 billion.

131
00:06:38.019 --> 00:06:41.250
Now, we present it to the dear Mr. Vina.

132
00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:45.449
Jesus!

133
00:06:45.449 --> 00:06:47.600
Oh my!

134
00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:52.069
Billion dollar gold mine!

135
00:06:52.069 --> 00:07:05.949
Sorry, I don't think I understand.

136
00:07:05.949 --> 00:07:08.019
That's the line from Lucinda.

137
00:07:08.019 --> 00:07:09.019
I don't say anything.

138
00:07:09.019 --> 00:07:11.019
Ladies and gentlemen, no need to make a fuss.

139
00:07:11.019 --> 00:07:15.019
These are just small tokens of sincerity from the Thorne Group.

140
00:07:15.019 --> 00:07:17.019
There are many more gifts to come.

141
00:07:17.019 --> 00:07:24.160
Is that the?

142
00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.670
Is that the legendary?

143
00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:30.670
The Musaev Red Diamond.

144
00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:32.769
And Patek Phillip Ladies Watch.

145
00:07:32.769 --> 00:07:36.769
Master Kelly designed and forged it with great care.

146
00:07:36.769 --> 00:07:38.769
It is a symbol of status.

147
00:07:38.769 --> 00:07:40.769
A one-of-a-kind gift.

148
00:07:40.769 --> 00:07:44.310
We present to Mr. Vina.

149
00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:45.310
Noah!

150
00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:46.660
We need to get that!

151
00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:48.759
The Red Diamond.

152
00:07:48.759 --> 00:07:50.790
It's the Red Diamond.

153
00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:51.790
Oh my God!

154
00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:54.790
No, Grace, don't do this!

155
00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:56.790
Do you like these gifts, Devina?

156
00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:58.790
These are far too expensive.

157
00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:03.920
Leo, we understand your intentions, but these gifts are way too expensive.

158
00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:04.920
We can't accept them.

159
00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:05.920
Don't worry, Bart.

160
00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:10.920
Nothing in this world is more valuable to me than Devina here.

161
00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:20.610
You're waking up as the only gift I need.

162
00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:21.610
I'm not wrong.

163
00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:22.610
This isn't the heir.

164
00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:23.610
This isn't the fucking heir.

165
00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:24.610
I'm right.

166
00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:26.220
Get him.

167
00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:28.589
You heard the man?

168
00:08:28.589 --> 00:08:32.950
Get him!

169
00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:33.950
No!

170
00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:36.330
No!

171
00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:37.330
Get off!

172
00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:38.330
Mr. Leo.

173
00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:39.330
No.

174
00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:40.330
Listen to me.

175
00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:41.549
It's too late to apologize now.

176
00:08:41.549 --> 00:08:42.549
Go to hell.

177
00:08:42.549 --> 00:08:43.549
No!

178
00:08:43.549 --> 00:08:44.549
No!

179
00:08:44.549 --> 00:08:46.450
Mr. Leo!

180
00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:47.450
Wait!

181
00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:48.450
Wait!

182
00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:52.940
Wait!

183
00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:53.940
Mr. Leo!

184
00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:54.940
Joseph didn't mean he didn't mean to offend you.

185
00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:55.940
No, he's a hard-working kid.

186
00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:57.940
You know, he's got a bright future ahead of him.

187
00:08:57.940 --> 00:08:58.940
Please, please.

188
00:08:58.940 --> 00:08:59.940

189
00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:00.940
Okay?

190
00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:02.940
Please, just don't take his whole life away for one stupid little mistake.

191
00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:03.940
Yes.

192
00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:04.940
Mr. Leo.

193
00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:05.940
I beg you.

194
00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:06.940
Please.

195
00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:08.940
Forgive Joseph this one time.

196
00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:11.940
He was just trying to teach some poor people a lesson.

197
00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:14.940
He's never really made any mistakes before.

198
00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:16.259
A lesson.

199
00:09:16.259 --> 00:09:20.350
So for you people, making fun of the poor is just trivial.

200
00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:21.350
Yes.

201
00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:23.350
And what's wrong with that?

202
00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:26.350
Those filthy beggars are just like rats.

203
00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:30.379
Millions are born and die everyday.

204
00:09:30.379 --> 00:09:33.379
Joseph was simply speeding up the process.

205
00:09:33.379 --> 00:09:35.379
Is that what you think?

206
00:09:35.379 --> 00:09:39.059
What you're saying is completely outrageous.

207
00:09:39.059 --> 00:09:41.570
Devina's right.

208
00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:43.570
You people make me sick.

209
00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:46.570
