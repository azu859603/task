00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.559
No, no, no, please, please Commander, don't let him go.

2
00:00:04.559 --> 00:00:06.320
I'm begging you, please Commander.

3
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:07.160
I'll hear you begging.

4
00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:08.800
I don't see no action.

5
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:09.640
Where's your bully?

6
00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.560
Laura and Joseph, now you disrespect me and Henry.

7
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.689
Disrespect the whole brand or mercenary group.

8
00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:17.690
David, I'm going to teach you a lesson today.

9
00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:19.170
Of course I'm going to take care of this fool.

10
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.530
No, no, no, Daniel!

11
00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:21.329
Daniel!

12
00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:24.059
Don't shoot, just go kill him, I'll kill Leo!

13
00:00:24.059 --> 00:00:26.820
No, it's none of their faults.

14
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.420
Don't listen to me.

15
00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.820
Let him go or you'll offend your biggest partner

16
00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.420
that you don't want to do that, do you think I'm right there?

17
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.549
You're talking that bullshit.

18
00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:38.109
I might or you're cursed, but soon you ain't going

19
00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:39.469
to be able to say it weren't.

20
00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:40.509
I'm going to deal with him.

21
00:00:40.509 --> 00:00:42.070
Then I'm dealing with you.

22
00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.189
No, no, no, don't shoot!

23
00:00:43.189 --> 00:00:44.710
Don't shoot!

24
00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:45.710
Ha!

25
00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:46.710
Ha!

26
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.869
Are you scared now, are you, kid?

27
00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:52.359
Tell you what, you send your mom up to my bed.

28
00:00:52.359 --> 00:01:02.929
She goes, all right, I'll let you all live.

29
00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:06.599
How dare you try to fight me, you crippled bastard.

30
00:01:07.599 --> 00:01:14.269
Don't you dare!

31
00:01:14.269 --> 00:01:15.269
The hell's going on?
