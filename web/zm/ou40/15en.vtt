00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.630
Brandor, he's the young Mr. Brandor, God damn it!

2
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.630
We're doomed, we're screwed!

3
00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:12.630
No!

4
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:13.699
God!

5
00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:14.699
Please!

6
00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:16.699
Oh sir, this has got to be a mistake.

7
00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:18.699
This can't be.

8
00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:21.019
Leo is my son.

9
00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:23.019
Cynthia is my wife.

10
00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:28.019
They didn't take my surname because the Thorne family has a special rule.

11
00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:34.020
Thorns cannot change the surname of a child until they reach a certain age.

12
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.020
You're scung.

13
00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.020
How dare you threaten my family?

14
00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.020
How dare you lie to my family?

15
00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.020
No.

16
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.500
What is going on?

17
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.500
Colbert!

18
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.500
Yes, Mr. Brandor.

19
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.920
No.

20
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.920
The fools who offended young Mr. Brandor will die by Memphis bullets.

21
00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.920
Memphis swear as to protect the Brandor.

22
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:02.920
No.

23
00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.140
I'm sorry sir, this was a mistake.

24
00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.140
Mr. Brandor?

25
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.140
Well done, Colbert.

26
00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.140
I think you're the right choice for the next governor's election.

27
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.239
Thank you, Mr. Brandor.

28
00:01:15.239 --> 00:01:24.659
Young Mr. Brandor, I would you like to deal with all these people that offended you.

29
00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.069
You have to stay troops after command.

30
00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:31.349
Very well.

31
00:01:31.349 --> 00:01:33.640
Thank you, Mr. Colbert.

32
00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.340
You're welcome, Mr. Brandor.

33
00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.340
Young Mr. Brandor.

34
00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:40.340
I was wrong.

35
00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.340
Please, please ring.

36
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.340
It was Drew.

37
00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.340
Drew who ordered me.

38
00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:44.340
It's not my fault.

39
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.189
Since you follow Drew's orders.

40
00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:51.609
Not only are you expelled from the Brandor group,

41
00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:54.609
but I'm confiscating all of your profits.

42
00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:55.609
Take him away!

43
00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:56.609
No!

44
00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:58.340
No!

45
00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.340
I can't think I thought you'd wear a group.

46
00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.340
I only know how to be a mercenary.

47
00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.540
Mr. Leo, please.

48
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:11.460
I beg you.

49
00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.800
Drew.

50
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.800
Joseph.

51
00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.539
You were very arrogant before,

52
00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:22.539
and if I remember correctly, you said you were going to sleep with my mother.

53
00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:25.729
And now that my father has arrived,

54
00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:27.729
all of a sudden you can't speak anymore.

55
00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:30.270
You were very arrogant,

56
00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.270
splashing your wealth and power everywhere.

57
00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.270
Well, now guess what?

58
00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.270
I'm taking all of that away from you today.
