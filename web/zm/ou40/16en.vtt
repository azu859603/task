00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.500
Leo, I'm such an asshole. I didn't know it was you.

2
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:09.500
I'm sorry, Mr. Thorpe. I mean, Mr. Brandor, I was wrong. Please don't banish me like you did, Henry.

3
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:15.500
Mr. Leo, sir, sir, I was wrong. We were so very wrong. Just please, please, please have mercy on us.

4
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.500
Will you give me all the money you want, sir? Just please, sir, spare us!

5
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.530
You think I need your money? Well, let me tell you something.

6
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.530
As of right now, I am confiscating all of your bank accounts.

7
00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:34.530
No? No? That's our money. You can't freeze it.

8
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.530
No, you can't do it. You can't do it. No.

9
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.530
Now you can both live like the beggars that you both disdain so much. Take them out of here.

10
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.530
No. No, you don't have that with me.

11
00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.530
No! I live without our money.

12
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.530
And you, you are banished from the Brandor group.

13
00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.820
I'm confiscating your bank accounts as well.

14
00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.820
No, Mr. Brandor, please, I'm begging you. Please forgive me for my foolish ignorance.

15
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.819
I can't be banished. I've got a lot of enemies. And those assets took me ten years to build.

16
00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:11.819
Let me tell you something. I don't care if you live or die.

17
00:01:11.819 --> 00:01:18.819
I didn't know you was Mr. Brandor Jr. Please forgive me, sir. Please, I was a mistake. I apologize.

18
00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:26.819
You shouldn't be apologizing to me. You should be apologizing to all of the women that you've manipulated over your entire life.

19
00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:34.849
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I said all them nasty things to those honorable women. Please forgive me, sir.

20
00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:43.849
Mr. Brandor, please, I'm begging you. It was a mistake. It was just a big mistake. You can't banish me. I won't last. They'll kill me.

21
00:01:43.849 --> 00:01:45.849
That's just not possible.

22
00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:54.620
No, please, sir. No. Don't move.
