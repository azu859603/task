1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,129
Dude, you stupid shit, I'm a piece of shit, what are you doing?

2
00:00:04,129 --> 00:00:05,889
You ruin me! You ruin me!

3
00:00:05,889 --> 00:00:07,990
Cause are you? I've got bandit!

4
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:12,230
I'm finished, cause of you.

5
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:15,480
Mr. Brandore thinks I'll betray him!

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,219
I'm gonna kill you!

7
00:00:17,219 --> 00:00:23,989
If you had come any later, you wouldn't have a wife in the trial last.

8
00:00:23,989 --> 00:00:29,859
Forgive me, darling, for being late.

9
00:00:29,859 --> 00:00:33,009
Leo, it's been so long.

10
00:00:33,009 --> 00:00:36,479
You've grown to an outstanding young man.

11
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:42,039
Mr. Dad.

12
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:49,409
All right, what are you planning on doing with these people?

13
00:00:49,409 --> 00:00:54,280
These people are going to wish that they've never ever been born into this world.

14
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:59,799
Jack Connor, take them away, yes sir.

15
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:06,709
I'm going to kill you, Mr. Brandore, please, please.

16
00:01:06,709 --> 00:01:11,099
And you, God, please, we know we were wrong.
