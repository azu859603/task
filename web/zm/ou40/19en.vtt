1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.359
I'm done. And I'm sorry.

2
00:00:03.359 --> 00:00:08.349
Really? You think I have to marry you? You'll regret this.

3
00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:15.800
Tevina. From now on, we have no more obstacles in our way.

4
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.100
And like I said, I will always protect you.

5
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:30.420
Dale, I trust you. You're a hero.

6
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.259
Mom. Dad.

7
00:00:33.259 --> 00:00:35.859
Devina's the one who took care of me.

8
00:00:35.859 --> 00:00:38.259
Those long three years while I was in a coma.

9
00:00:38.259 --> 00:00:45.570
She worked tirelessly every day to pay for my treatment.

10
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:52.259
She's my garden angel. I want her to be my life.

11
00:00:52.259 --> 00:00:56.990
Leo, you're not being very genuinely.

12
00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:03.039
You haven't even asked dear Devina if she's willing.

13
00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:10.969
Right, I am. Sorry I got too excited.

14
00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:14.700
Remarining. I will.

15
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:28.909
Leo is back and I will host a grand welcome party for you.

16
00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:33.680
And we will announce that Leo and Devina are getting married.

17
00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:40.640
That's a brilliant idea, my dear. Dear friends, please invite all of your family and friends.

18
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:49.780
We'll make a major announcement that Devina will be a member of the Brandoar family.

19
00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:57.219
Mr. Brandoar, we might not do it this way because we don't have a lot of money.

20
00:01:57.219 --> 00:02:01.540
We don't have a big family or a lot of friends.
