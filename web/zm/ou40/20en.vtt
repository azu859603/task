Dear friends, they distanced themselves from you because they're true forlage.

2
00:00:05.019 --> 00:00:07.019
Well, because of anything you did.

3
00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:08.240
Yes.

4
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.240
They're going to miss a huge opportunity, for sure.

5
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.240
Thank you, Mr. Brandor.

6
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.240
This door?

7
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:22.359
Well, in that case, I'll call everyone I know and invite them to Leo's welcoming, worry.

8
00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:26.359
I want Leo and Davina to have everyone's blessing.

9
00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:32.500
Well, that's a great idea, Barton. Let's do it.

10
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.719
Davina, why don't you invite your friends to the, to the quarry?

11
00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:45.070
Friends, Leo, our situation is worse than you think.

12
00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.140
No one will associate with us as out of my uncle's family.

13
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:57.899
Hi, Bob. This is Barton. I wanted to...

14
00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.929
How did it go?

15
00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:01.929
You hung up.

16
00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:05.780
You see?
