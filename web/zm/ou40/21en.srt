00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,830
Mr. Bailey, what are you thinking, Leo?

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:11,429
I was thinking that maybe I should send out the invitations for the party with a brand

3
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:12,429
or name on it.

4
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:14,609
Maybe it'll be more convenient that way.

5
00:00:14,609 --> 00:00:18,429
Of course, everyone's going to answer an invitation for the brand or a man.

6
00:00:18,429 --> 00:00:21,149
Yes, and that way we don't have to make any calls.

7
00:00:21,149 --> 00:00:23,910
All right, Leo.

8
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:28,940
I know you don't want to leave Davina, but you need to return your family first.

9
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:30,859
Your uncles are extremely worried about you.

10
00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:33,490
They spend a lot of money trying to find you.

11
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:41,149
Of course, Dad.

12
00:00:41,149 --> 00:00:43,820
I'll see you at the party.

13
00:00:43,820 --> 00:01:00,380
I'll see you at the party.

14
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:06,879
Send an invitation to Davina's uncle's family, but do not mention my relationship with her.

15
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:11,799
Sir, do as I say, my reasons.

16
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:13,280
As you say, sir, I'll handle it.
