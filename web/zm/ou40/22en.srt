00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,559
What a lovely place. Oh, Barton. This is my first time in a place like this. Do you think

2
00:00:21,559 --> 00:00:27,359
Bob and the others will come? Well, they would have to, right? It's an invitation from the

3
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:33,039
brand rules. There's really no reason for them not to. Guys, it's okay. Leo knows our

4
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:38,880
situation and besides, even if no one comes, it's not gonna affect our loved ones.

5
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:52,979
Yeah, our luck is finally changed. Brando's invited us to young Brando's welcoming party.

6
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:58,250
This is a chance to meet some big names. My boyfriend Billy's father is a hotel

7
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:04,530
manager here. We can accuse us around. Absolutely. Maybe. We can even meet the

8
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:08,890
family members of the Brando family. You know it. My dear, I knew you meet the

9
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:13,930
perfect boyfriend. You're a thousand times better than that. Silly Divina in her

10
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:18,760
terrible Bailey family. You know what? She can bring herself to leave that

11
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:29,180
losing boyfriend of hers. She's not even qualified enough to be compared to me. You

12
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:33,519
made it. Barton, what the hell you doing here? How did you even get an

13
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:37,519
invitation to the Brando party in the first place?
