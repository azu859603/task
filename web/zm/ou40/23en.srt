1
00:00:01,389 --> 00:00:06,089
Bob, even though it's been a while, I knew you'd still come.

2
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:11,130
Yes, Uncle Bob, I really appreciate that you're still willing to reach out to us.

3
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:15,830
No, no, no, no. This has the reasons we are here have nothing to do with you at all.

4
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:19,429
Bob, I tried to call you yesterday.

5
00:00:19,429 --> 00:00:22,730
Young Mr. Brandore will be announcing his engagement to Divina.

6
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:26,129
I tried to tell you, but you hung up, or would you just shut up?

7
00:00:26,129 --> 00:00:27,730
Do you even know what you're saying?

8
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:31,030
This is unbelievable. You're disgusting poor people.

9
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:35,100
How serious do you think of such delusions?

10
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:42,100
Leo, did you tell Jack not to mention your relationship with Divina in the reception invitation?

11
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:52,109
That's correct. We will spoil Divina's family and friends with a typical Brandore family hospitality.

12
00:00:52,109 --> 00:00:55,710
But until then, I want to conduct a little test.

13
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:59,210
To see where Divina's family and friends loyalty lies.

14
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:02,090
Oh, I see.

15
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:04,090
I'll be heading down to the party.

16
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:08,590
Governor Colbert's and father should be finishing their conversation soon.

17
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:14,180
I suggest you get me down here soon.
