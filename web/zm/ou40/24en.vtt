00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
Guys, we're serious.

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.519
Davina is going to marry Mr. Leo Brando.

3
00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:07.440
Didn't you see that on the invitation?

4
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.279
This is Mr. Leo Brando's welcoming party.

5
00:00:10.279 --> 00:00:12.160
It is not a wedding announcement,

6
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.279
so I don't know what the hell you're talking about.

7
00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:16.320
Daniel, you and Martin need to shut up

8
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.239
and stop spreading rumors.

9
00:00:18.239 --> 00:00:19.920
Where's he being?

10
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:20.760
Did you hear that?

11
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.440
These idiots actually think Mr. Leo Brando

12
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.399
would marry this poor girl.

13
00:00:25.399 --> 00:00:30.160
I think they've been reading too many fairy tales.

14
00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.679
The young Mr. Brando would be better off marrying me.

15
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.880
But it's true, Davina.

16
00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.200
These wealthy and powerful people don't accept us.

17
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.320
Maybe it was a mistake showing up.

18
00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.920
I can't believe Leo didn't tell Bob's family about the wedding.

19
00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.799
You think he's having second thoughts about the marriage?

20
00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:51.840
No.

21
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.729
I don't know, we have to stress Leo.

22
00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:57.049
Mom, you've said we were the guests of honor

23
00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:58.770
at the party just like yourself.

24
00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:06.280
Idiots.

25
00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:13.379
Mia, are these the relatives of your uncle's family?

26
00:01:13.379 --> 00:01:16.099
What a bunch of losers.

27
00:01:16.099 --> 00:01:18.900
Like you said, they've ruined your good mood.

28
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.099
I don't like that.

29
00:01:20.099 --> 00:01:22.409
Do you want me to kick them out?

30
00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.849
You're so sweet.

31
00:01:23.849 --> 00:01:29.189
You don't even worry.

32
00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.540
Security, I'll take out the trash.
