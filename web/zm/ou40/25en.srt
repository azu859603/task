1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,540
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, you threw out the thief's voice out!

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:04,500
Idiot.

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,360
Billy's father is the owner of the hotel.

4
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,359
If he wants to teach you a lesson,

5
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:10,839
he just has to say the word!

6
00:00:10,839 --> 00:00:11,539
It's right.

7
00:00:11,539 --> 00:00:14,359
Me, isn't as stupid as you are wasted on your time and money

8
00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:16,620
when you're pathetic boyfriend.

9
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,739
And now you're breaking into this noble party

10
00:00:18,739 --> 00:00:21,260
pretending to Mr. Brandar is gonna marry you?

11
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:23,000
Okay, Daddy can you be!

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,579
Your stupidity is a cloy.

13
00:00:24,579 --> 00:00:26,660
I think the most ridiculous person in the world.

14
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:39,039
Bob, watch your mouth!

15
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:43,539
The Vita is not stupid. We never lied. Everything we said was the truth.

16
00:00:43,539 --> 00:00:44,840
Oh, Barney.

17
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,759
Being promised to ride in your brain.

18
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:49,759
I actually feel sorry for you.

19
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:51,759
I really don't know.

20
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:52,759
I'm pathetic.

21
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:57,259
It seems that we should have attended that ridiculous fundraiser that you threw.

22
00:00:57,259 --> 00:01:00,259
Maybe if we donated some money, you wouldn't be so dramatic.

23
00:01:00,259 --> 00:01:02,759
Don't you dare speak to my father like that.

24
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:03,759
We are family.

25
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:05,760
How can you be so cruel?

26
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,760
I feel like girls.

27
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,260
Oh, he made cruel.

28
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:10,760
There's some other slums on you all the way from here.

29
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,760
You're polluting the air of this party.

30
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,760
You make me sick.

31
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,760
Get the hell out of here, you favorite.

32
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:30,810
Just because you're wealthy does not mean you shouldn't insult others.

33
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:34,799
Aubrey lies in your soul.

34
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,409
Meow.

35
00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:42,409
Mr. and Mrs. Bailey, why don't you two go relax in the VIP room?

36
00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:45,760
My end of this.

37
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:50,349
I'll stay with Devina.

38
00:01:50,349 --> 00:01:53,349
Daniel, you must protect Devina.

39
00:01:53,349 --> 00:01:58,359
So, you're Leo.

40
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:00,900
This is the one you've been talking about all these years.

41
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:04,950
You really shouldn't talk about yourself like that.

42
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:05,950
What?

43
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:07,950
Shut up, you piece of shit.

44
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:10,590
You're just a vegetable in a suit.

45
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,590
Do you really think that you're a billionaire?

46
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,590
Billy's my boyfriend.

47
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:16,590
And his father's a hotel manager.

48
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:17,590
Show some damn respect.

49
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,590
Aah, arrogant fool.

50
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:22,590
You just now call the tea room and the VIP room.

51
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:25,590
Everyone knows that the VIP room is for the friend or only.

52
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,590
You have no right to be here.

53
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:28,590
Me neither.

54
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:31,069
Is Devina really still your girlfriend?

55
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:35,069
She was just fantasizing about marrying a thing on Mr. Brandor.

56
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:37,069
What a foolish girl.

57
00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:39,069
She's nothing but a peasant.

58
00:02:39,069 --> 00:02:41,069
You can't talk to Devina like that.

59
00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:42,960
Jay!

60
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,250
Idiots.

61
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:48,919
What I said earlier, wasn't direct enough.

62
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:52,169
Let's try again and I'll be more clear this time.

63
00:02:52,169 --> 00:02:57,169
Your sister Devina is nothing but a filthy disease written for.

64
00:02:57,169 --> 00:02:58,169
Shit.

65
00:02:58,169 --> 00:03:02,509
You're the disease written for no more.

66
00:03:02,509 --> 00:03:04,509
Oh, David, you're talking about Devina.

67
00:03:04,509 --> 00:03:07,509
You're not even worthy of touching one single strand.

68
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:17,909
I'm gonna insult Devina like that and you have to be ready for my revenge.

69
00:03:17,909 --> 00:03:18,909
You piece of shit!

70
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:27,199
If either of you keep insulting Devina like that, your family won't even be able to recognize their own family's corpse acceptable.

71
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:32,680
I appreciate it, Leo, but please stop fighting your bodies.

72
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,759
I'm not doing for you.

73
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:36,759
You hear that?

74
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:38,759
I'm letting you go because she asked me too and you're lucky.

75
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:39,759
I'm crazy, though.

76
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:41,800
Your piece of shit.

77
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,800
You and that bitch girlfriend of yours.

78
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,800
My father gets here.

79
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,800
I want you to kneel down with fucking boots.

80
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:57,719
Kyle, today's Mr. Leo's welcome party.

81
00:03:57,719 --> 00:04:02,719
Furthermore, he will be announcing his engagement to a wonderful young woman.

82
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:07,719
It is a great honor the Brandois have chosen your hotel for this event.

83
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:08,719
Do not.

84
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:11,719
I repeat, do not mess this up.

85
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:16,779
Oh, I will assure you the party will go up extremely well.

86
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:20,779
I hope to earn considerable favors from the Brandoir family.

87
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:24,230
It would be my greatest honor.

88
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:29,439
Keep Devina's name out of your filthy rat mouth.

89
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:32,439
Billy, I want to make sure I heard this correctly.

90
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:36,509
Did you say that your father is the hotel manager?

91
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:38,509
Yeah, that's right.

92
00:04:38,509 --> 00:04:39,639
Are you afraid?

93
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:41,639
Because it's too fucking late now.

94
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:51,629
Because the hotel manager is nothing but a ward on my pinky.

95
00:04:51,629 --> 00:04:52,629
You scum.

96
00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:53,629
You scum.

97
00:04:53,629 --> 00:04:54,629
Piece of shit.

98
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:57,810
How dare you insult my father like that?

99
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:01,639
You and that bitch girlfriend of yours.

100
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:02,639
You scum.

101
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:03,639
Watch your mouth.

102
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:04,639
What are you going to do about it?

103
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,639
Your sister's a whore.

104
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:06,639
Disgusting, brainless idiot.

105
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,459
Say another word about Devina.

106
00:05:10,459 --> 00:05:21,480
And you're going to find out what hell looks like.

107
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,480
Loser.

108
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,759
You loser.

109
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,759
See, in this world, the rich can teach the poor a lesson.

110
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,759
In this world, the rich beat the poor.

111
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,889
You welfare peasants have no voice.

112
00:05:33,889 --> 00:05:34,889
You're done.

113
00:05:34,889 --> 00:05:36,889
Your words are pure ignorance.

114
00:05:36,889 --> 00:05:38,889
All men are created equal.

115
00:05:38,889 --> 00:05:39,889
Devina's right.

116
00:05:39,889 --> 00:05:41,889
Wealth isn't everything.

117
00:05:41,889 --> 00:05:46,889
You insult women with your filthy words and you place money above everything else.

118
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:48,889
The world looks down on you.

119
00:05:48,889 --> 00:05:52,439
Even if you wore a gold card and carried them.

120
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:57,439
The world's most expensive cane, everyone would still look down on you in disrespect.

121
00:05:58,439 --> 00:05:59,439
That's cute.

122
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:00,439
Daniel?

123
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:02,629
Don't you stand there.

124
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:04,629
He's been disrespecting your sister.

125
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:06,629
I think it's time that you teach him a lesson.

126
00:06:06,629 --> 00:06:07,629
Come on.

127
00:06:07,629 --> 00:06:08,629
Let's go.

128
00:06:08,629 --> 00:06:09,629
Let's go.

129
00:06:09,629 --> 00:06:10,759
Come on.

130
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:12,589
Asshole.

131
00:06:12,589 --> 00:06:19,319
Stop it.

132
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:20,639
Dad.

133
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:21,639
The buoy.

134
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:22,639
Mr. Leo.

135
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,180
He did this.

136
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:27,180
That scum in his bitch girlfriend of his.

137
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:32,240
And they crashed this event and had this peasant beat me up.

138
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,680
Him.

139
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,680
You did this?

140
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:46,110
But I feel like that's the whole tell man.

141
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:51,680
You should find out who's responsible and handle the situation.

142
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:57,240
Oh my God.

143
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,240
You stupid pauper.

144
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,240
Don't you tell me what to do.

145
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,839
Leo, are you okay?

146
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,839
Devina, don't worry about mine.

147
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:06,839
This is honestly kind of fun.

148
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:10,839
The more they break about their wealth, the more arrogance they have.

149
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:12,839
The louder they'll beg for mercy later.

150
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:13,839
But.

151
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:14,839
Daniel.

152
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:16,839
They slapped you twice and me once.

153
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:17,839
That's thrice.

154
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:21,069
It's time to give it back to them.

155
00:07:21,069 --> 00:07:23,069
What a joke.

156
00:07:23,069 --> 00:07:26,069
Look at your perilous pathetic boyfriend.

157
00:07:26,069 --> 00:07:28,069
Nothing but a clown.

158
00:07:28,069 --> 00:07:29,290
Where is she?

159
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:32,290
Leo is not a joke or a clown.

160
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:42,230
I've said multiple times that money and wealth isn't everything does not make a good person.

161
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:49,230
Besides, even if you were rich, the Bailey's have a gold mine worth five billion dollars.

162
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:52,449
I doubt you have anything that compares to that.

163
00:07:52,449 --> 00:07:54,449
Oh blah blah blah.

164
00:07:54,449 --> 00:07:56,480
Bullshit.

165
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:00,480
And I have a gold mine worth ten million dollars.

166
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:05,480
And I'm going to go play golf with Governor Colbert next week too.

167
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,709
Great new loser.

168
00:08:07,709 --> 00:08:11,709
Governor Colbert will be joining us later today.

169
00:08:11,709 --> 00:08:14,709
But he's here to see me.

170
00:08:14,709 --> 00:08:15,709
Not you.

171
00:08:15,709 --> 00:08:17,709
He's actually here to congratulate me.

172
00:08:17,709 --> 00:08:18,709
Alright.

173
00:08:18,709 --> 00:08:19,709
Whatever.

174
00:08:19,709 --> 00:08:20,709
You bragging little jerk.

175
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:21,709
Alright?

176
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:23,709
I'm going to that bitch girlfriend here.

177
00:08:23,709 --> 00:08:25,709
You know what?

178
00:08:25,709 --> 00:08:30,709
Your mother must have been a whore to raise someone like you.

179
00:08:30,709 --> 00:08:31,709
Shut up.

180
00:08:31,709 --> 00:08:33,710
Daniel, what are you waiting for?

181
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,090
It's time.

182
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:36,090
What are you going to do?

183
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:37,090
Yeah.

184
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:39,090
You don't have enough courage to do anything if you...

185
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:40,090
Dead.

186
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:41,090
Hey.

187
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:43,279
Good job, Daniel.

188
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:48,279
Today we're teaching this comma lesson for degrading women and using a little bit of power.

189
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:52,889
Well, I'm going to call security and you're all being jammed.

190
00:08:52,889 --> 00:08:54,889
I hope you all die.

191
00:08:54,889 --> 00:08:56,370
Jack.

192
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,370
Listen, Dyson, what are you doing?

193
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:00,370
Shut the fuck up, Kyle.

194
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:04,370
From the moment you slapped Mr. Video, your hotel no longer exists.

195
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:09,059
Mr. Dyson, no.

196
00:09:09,059 --> 00:09:10,059
Why are you listening to this guy?

197
00:09:10,059 --> 00:09:11,059
He's just a troublemaker.

198
00:09:11,059 --> 00:09:13,059
Why are you treating him with such respect?

199
00:09:13,059 --> 00:09:14,059
Dyson, what are you doing?

200
00:09:14,059 --> 00:09:16,059
Why are you hurting my dad?

201
00:09:16,059 --> 00:09:17,059
This is a mistake.

202
00:09:17,059 --> 00:09:18,059
Leo.

203
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:19,059
Bastard.

204
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:21,059
You're a worthless piece of garbage.

205
00:09:21,059 --> 00:09:23,059
Nothing but a rat.

206
00:09:23,059 --> 00:09:27,639
Doc.

207
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:30,379
Doc, what are you doing?

208
00:09:30,379 --> 00:09:32,379
We have nothing to offend you.

209
00:09:32,379 --> 00:09:38,379
But you've offended Mr. Leo and that is far more important than offending me.

210
00:09:38,379 --> 00:09:39,759
What?

211
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:40,759
He's nothing but a beggar.

212
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:41,759
Then we're not his girlfriend.

213
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:43,759
Why would you show him so much respect?

214
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:45,759
No, it's quite the opposite.

215
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:47,759
Mr. Dyson, why did you hit us?

216
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:50,759
I mean, who is this noble scum?

217
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:52,759
Who is he, really?

218
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:53,759
What's the rush?

219
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,759
You'll soon find out who I am.

220
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:57,759
And then you'll beg for mercy.

221
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:08,200
He's there.

222
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,559
I think I just saw the chairman of the thorn group.

223
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:12,559
Oh my God.

224
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:14,559
That's Mr. Brandor.

225
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:17,559
He's the head of the Brandor group.

226
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:24,279
Mr. Brandor.

227
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:25,279
He is here.

228
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,279
Oh my God.

229
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:27,279
We're actually giving him.

230
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,279
He's such a celebrity person.

231
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:34,539
Mr. Brandor.

232
00:10:34,539 --> 00:10:35,539
Mr. Brandor.

233
00:10:35,539 --> 00:10:38,539
We offer our sincere greetings, Mr. Brandor.

234
00:10:38,539 --> 00:10:39,539
Yes.

235
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:45,539
Your presence in this grand hotel brings even more light to such a grand place.

236
00:10:45,539 --> 00:10:47,539
Your sincerity touches me.

237
00:10:47,539 --> 00:10:54,559
Mr. Cloud.

238
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:55,559
Miss Cynthia.

239
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:58,289
I'm glad you're here.

240
00:10:58,289 --> 00:10:59,610
So tell me.

241
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:02,610
How did the conversation with Governor Colbert go?

242
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:03,610
You scum.

243
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:07,639
How dare you face the chairman of the thorn group.

244
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:11,639
This is Miss Cynthia and the esteemed Mr. Brandor.

245
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:13,639
How dare you speak with them.

246
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:14,639
Yes.

247
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:15,639
Sure loser.

248
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:18,639
How dare you disrespect Mr. Brandor like that.

249
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:20,639
He's looking at gravestones.

250
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:21,639
Where to put it right now?

251
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:22,639
That's right.

252
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:24,639
We're going to die today, kid.

253
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:25,639
Enough.

254
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:26,639
Everybody.

255
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:29,929
Do you even know the theme of this party?

256
00:11:29,929 --> 00:11:30,929
We do, Mr. Brandor.

257
00:11:30,929 --> 00:11:33,929
This is a welcome party for the young Mr. Brandor.

258
00:11:33,929 --> 00:11:35,929
We've got gifts and everything.

259
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:38,929
Just young Mr. Brandor hasn't arrived yet.

260
00:11:38,929 --> 00:11:39,929
Nonsense.

261
00:11:39,929 --> 00:11:48,759
What do you think is standing in front of you?

262
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:49,759
What?

263
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:50,759
Mr. Brandor?

264
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:51,759
What do you mean?

265
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:53,759
You mean, could it be?

266
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:55,759
The young Mr. Brandor?

267
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:57,759
But that's impossible.

268
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:58,759
Silly girl.

269
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,759
The truth is right in front of you yet.

270
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:02,759
You still say it's impossible.

271
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:09,399
You've been ruined.

272
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:11,399
Leo wasn't trying to cause you any trouble.

273
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:14,399
He just wanted to find out who your true family and friends are.

274
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,200
You know that he is what we need to do with any.

275
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,230
Thank you for telling me, Miss Cynthia.

276
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:23,700
I completely understand.

277
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,700
Today is Leo Brandor's homecoming party.

278
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:31,659
Leo is Cynthia, my son.

279
00:12:31,659 --> 00:12:38,129
He didn't use my surname only because of the Thorne family's family tradition.

280
00:12:38,129 --> 00:12:48,289
My son is an outstanding young man who will inherit everything that belongs to the Thorne family and the Brandor group.

281
00:12:48,289 --> 00:12:52,759
That news wasn't great enough.

282
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:55,620
We have another big announcement.

283
00:12:55,620 --> 00:13:02,960
Divina Bailey.

284
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,000
Kind.

285
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,440
And loving young lady.

286
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,799
During the three years that Leo was in the home,

287
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:13,799
Divina dropped out of school and used all of her savings.

288
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:16,799
To treat and care for our son.

289
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:22,990
The love between Divina and Leo is strong and tender.

290
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:30,000
And as expected, Leo is going to marry Divina.

291
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
This loser?

292
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
He kept me the young Mr. Brandor.

293
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,230
And then Divina is going to marry him?

294
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:37,289
That can't be true.

295
00:13:37,289 --> 00:13:47,500
Mr. Brandor and Mrs. Thorne, Governor Colbert has arrived.

296
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,500
Please, invite them in.

297
00:13:50,500 --> 00:14:10,490
To meet you Mr. and the young Mr. Brandor.

298
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:14,490
And of course, the beautiful Mrs. Cynthia and Mr. Vintra.

299
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:15,490
A pleasure.

300
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:21,600
Thank you for joining us on such a short notice. I totally appreciate it.

301
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,600
A pleasure indeed. We have more gifts to bless your marriage.

302
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,669
You are made for each other.

303
00:14:28,669 --> 00:14:33,990
Your story is the most touching story we have ever heard.

304
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:42,269
These are two pure world couplings.

305
00:14:42,269 --> 00:14:45,269
Handcar by Master Robert.

306
00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:49,269
The pair for the gentlemen is elegant and solid.

307
00:14:49,269 --> 00:14:54,330
While the pair for the lady is delicate and exquisite.

308
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:58,330
These are for the young Mr. Brandor and Mrs. Divina.

309
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:02,330
Wishing them a beautiful happiness in the future.

310
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:08,820
The tradition worldwide in a husband's auction?

311
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,820
Please, old friend, it's sounding ten million dollars.

312
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:21,490
What?

313
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:26,320
This is a silver tea set.

314
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,480
Handcrafted by a royal artisan.

315
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:33,509
I worked very hard to acquire it from a Danish collector.

316
00:15:33,509 --> 00:15:35,509
With the fine exquisite.

317
00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:39,509
Therefore the couple to bring them joy and a happiness full of love.

318
00:15:39,509 --> 00:15:42,700
I know that. I've seen that.

319
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,700
That's a family heirloom from the royal Dutch family.

320
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,700
Someone just tried to buy that for thirty million dollars.

321
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:52,759
I can't believe it's here. I never thought I'd see that.

322
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:53,759
It's my year.

323
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:56,759
I almost feel as though I don't deserve them.

324
00:15:56,759 --> 00:16:00,799
You looked after our Leo when he was lost to us and no one else would.

325
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:02,799
You deserve more than you can imagine.

326
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:07,950
Governor, these gifts are unbelievably precious and elegant.

327
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:08,950
Thank you.

328
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:13,960
We will cherish your blessings, Governor.

329
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,379
Oh, I'm Billy.

330
00:16:16,379 --> 00:16:17,379
I almost forgot.

331
00:16:17,379 --> 00:16:21,379
Didn't you say earlier that you were going to dinner with Governor Colbert

332
00:16:21,379 --> 00:16:23,379
and you were going to play golf with him?

333
00:16:23,379 --> 00:16:26,539
He's right here. Why don't you ask him?

334
00:16:26,539 --> 00:16:31,570
Mr. Brando, please, I'm begging you.

335
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:34,279
I'm begging you.

336
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:36,279
Forgive me. Please.

337
00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:38,279
Forgive me. I'm begging you.

338
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:41,279
Look, I'm sorry. We didn't know who you were.

339
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,820
We made a great mistake.

340
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:46,919
We were being very foolish before.

341
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:47,919
Please.

342
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:54,240
Can forgive us.

343
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,269
While you were all Divina's family, and I do want to go easy on you,

344
00:16:58,269 --> 00:17:01,269
you have completely let wealth and power get to your heads.

345
00:17:01,269 --> 00:17:09,970
You do not deserve to be Divina's family or friends.

346
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:12,420
It's oblivious when you were Divina's friends.

347
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:14,420
You didn't mean her, Divina.

348
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,420
Do I need to remind you how you've treated her?

349
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,420
And you even slapped her brother.

350
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:22,630
Divina, what do you think?

351
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:28,319
When they needed help, my parents stepped in and gave them a hand.

352
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,319
But when the roles were reversed, they beat us.

353
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:33,319
And even insulted us.

354
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:35,869
We don't need family like that.

355
00:17:35,869 --> 00:17:38,869
Divina, how could you be so heartless?

356
00:17:38,869 --> 00:17:39,869
We're family.

357
00:17:39,869 --> 00:17:41,869
Divina, please, stand up.

358
00:17:41,869 --> 00:17:44,410
What, you're still planning, Divina?

359
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:47,509
Sir, you are beyond saving. Take them away!

360
00:17:47,509 --> 00:17:49,759
We can't do this.

361
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:51,799
We have to be his uncle!

362
00:17:51,799 --> 00:17:52,799
The family!

363
00:17:52,799 --> 00:18:14,019
How could you do it?

364
00:18:14,019 --> 00:18:19,099
If our obstacles are out of our way, we can get married.

365
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:21,450
We have a beautiful life together.

366
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:23,450
Leo, this feels like a dream.

367
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:27,279
Leo, reset the engagement ring you prepare.

368
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:32,569
Divina, Leo spent a long time picking up that ring just to make you happy.

369
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:53,579
Leo Brandor, don't you want to know why you had that car accident years ago?
