00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.839
This is complete nonsense.

2
00:00:02.839 --> 00:00:04.839
I mean, if it wasn't for the stupid engagement,

3
00:00:04.839 --> 00:00:05.940
would you even care about me?

4
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.639
Do you understand the consequences

5
00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:10.439
of breaking off an engagement like this?

6
00:00:10.439 --> 00:00:12.740
All I know is that your slut of a daughter

7
00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.439
sucked with my fiance.

8
00:00:14.439 --> 00:00:23.289
Do you keep Ella out of this?

9
00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:24.690
Excuse me.

10
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:25.989
Where am I?

11
00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:26.989
My home.

12
00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:28.190
I saved you.

13
00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:28.989
You saved me.

14
00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:30.089
Yes.

15
00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:33.759
Also, what sort of trouble did you run into last night?

16
00:00:33.759 --> 00:00:35.570
What do you mean?

17
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:36.670
Mr. Homeless Man.

18
00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.070
If you were getting caught for stealing,

19
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.070
I highly recommend a more respectable job

20
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.869
because that's no way to live.

21
00:00:42.869 --> 00:00:44.570
Homeless Man.

22
00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.869
Me.

23
00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:50.899
Well, since I did save you,

24
00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:54.600
don't you think it's only fair that you repay me?

25
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.799
Don't worry.

26
00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:57.600
Don't need any of your money.

27
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.710
Just need you to do this one thing for me.

28
00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.909
And that one thing...

29
00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:05.329
Bean.

30
00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:06.329
Marry me.
