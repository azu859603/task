00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.620
Stop! Let go of her!

2
00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.120
And who are you?

3
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.939
Don't you dare?

4
00:00:08.939 --> 00:00:09.939
I would catch my wife.

5
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:18.300
Clearly, everyone here can see that Charlotte is engaged to me,

6
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.300
and today is our wedding day.

7
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.800
You're wrong. This man here is my husband.

8
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.429
Darling, don't be mad at me.

9
00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:29.429
Can't just come home and we will talk.

10
00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:37.700
And marry. No pretending.

11
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:43.130
Kind of sick.

12
00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:52.329
Jackson White?

13
00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:58.939
Jackson White as in the Jackson White of the White Jewelry Group?

14
00:00:58.939 --> 00:01:07.069
You may share the same name as a well-established company president,

15
00:01:07.069 --> 00:01:11.069
but that doesn't mean you can act all high and mighty.

16
00:01:11.069 --> 00:01:15.069
I've heard stories of an ugly duckling,

17
00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:19.069
but I have never heard a story of an ugly bum

18
00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:23.459
dreaming of fairy tales in broad daylight.

19
00:01:23.459 --> 00:01:27.989
Ha! Ha!

20
00:01:27.989 --> 00:01:31.120
Well, you got one thing right.

21
00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.120
My name is actually Jackson White,

22
00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.250
and I am the president of the White Jewelry Group.

23
00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.250
Um, we've never met a Jackson White of the White Jewelry Group.

24
00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.250
How can you possibly be him?

25
00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.250
Well, for people like you, it's quite rare to have the privilege of meeting someone like me.

26
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:54.659
Clearly, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that you are a poor, homeless man

27
00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.159
picked up off the streets.

28
00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.159
Let's go home.
