1
00:00:10,289 --> 00:00:11,890
Are you okay?

2
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:16,510
Hey, Jackson. Hey, when you get back, we had no idea.

3
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:18,609
Hey, do you want to go out with us tonight?

4
00:00:18,609 --> 00:00:20,609
How do you two know each other?

5
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:27,050
Oh, we used to go and drink together at bars.

6
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:29,239
Yeah, we're just drinking buddies.

7
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:30,690
Yeah.

8
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:34,689
Well, now please go enjoy your food.

9
00:00:34,689 --> 00:00:39,020
Yeah.

10
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:41,109
What an incredible coincidence.

11
00:00:41,109 --> 00:00:45,109
Yeah, well, I just happened to wander around a lot

12
00:00:45,109 --> 00:00:46,109
and meet many people.

13
00:00:46,109 --> 00:00:49,880
Jackson, having a lot of friends is a blessing.

14
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,390
You should come work for me.

15
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:55,390
Well, I might consider that.

16
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:57,869
Hey!

17
00:00:57,869 --> 00:01:06,340
The ladies allergic to roses, please take them away.

18
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:08,340
Allergic to roses?

19
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,340
How do they not notice?
