00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.399
The ladies allergic to roses, please take them away.

2
00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:09.019
Hey, I'm Landon.

3
00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:10.220
I'm Charlotte's best friend.

4
00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:13.210
We've been friends since we were kids.

5
00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:14.810
Best friend?

6
00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:17.010
Why does this feel so off?

7
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.260
He doesn't know how to win her over.

8
00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.059
I won't let fear keep me from Charlotte.

9
00:00:24.059 --> 00:00:26.460
I am the only one who truly sees her.

10
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.859
What are you guys doing?

11
00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:32.979
So, when did you get back?

12
00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:35.380
As soon as I heard you were getting married.

13
00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.770
So, who's this?

14
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:44.759
I'm Charlotte's husband.

15
00:00:44.759 --> 00:00:47.159
I see that you have many close relationships

16
00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:49.159
with many artists in the industry.

17
00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:53.359
However, you should be aware that this job requires

18
00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:56.560
a deep understanding of the arts itself.

19
00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.159
Understandably so.

20
00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:01.759
Last year, you provided market values for several

21
00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:04.959
emerging artists that were significantly above the market rates.

22
00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:07.760
I mean, those actions seem rather unreasonable, though.

23
00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.959
According to the Art Basel EBS report,

24
00:01:09.959 --> 00:01:11.959
the primary buyer's demographic has shifted

25
00:01:11.959 --> 00:01:13.760
towards the Generation Z market,

26
00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.159
which represents a completely new target audience

27
00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:22.670
for the arts community.

28
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.469
You actually came to the interview.

29
00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:26.670
Of course I did.

30
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.870
I realized that I really do need a job.

31
00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.069
And fortunately for me, you get to be my boss.

32
00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:35.069
Well, since you're such a keen understanding of art,

33
00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:38.930
let me show you what my favorite place is.

34
00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:40.930
Well, this is interesting.

35
00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.329
This is the gallery that I personally invested in.

36
00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:45.329
What's wrong?

37
00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:46.329
You don't like it?

38
00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:53.769
No, I love it.

39
00:01:53.769 --> 00:01:55.769
Any pieces that interest you?

40
00:01:55.769 --> 00:01:57.769
Well, last time I was here, I paid the deposit

41
00:01:57.769 --> 00:01:58.769
for the David's painting.

42
00:01:58.769 --> 00:01:59.769
Unfortunately.

43
00:01:59.769 --> 00:02:02.769
David is definitely a very talented artist.

44
00:02:02.769 --> 00:02:04.769
My boyfriend also adores his work.

45
00:02:04.769 --> 00:02:06.769
You certainly have a wonderful taste.

46
00:02:06.769 --> 00:02:08.990
Boyfriend.

47
00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.789
Yes, we are both big fans.

48
00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:12.789
Please, do follow me.

49
00:02:12.789 --> 00:02:23.259
Mike, it seems Charlotte has her eye on this painting, too.

50
00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:25.259
Whatever shall we do?

51
00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:26.259
Apologies, ma'am.

52
00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:28.259
This lady's already paid the deposit.

53
00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:29.259
Is that so?

54
00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:30.259
Strange.

55
00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:32.259
Since she can hardly afford it.

56
00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:33.259
Yes, I'm sorry.

57
00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:35.259
My cousin simply lacks the funds.

58
00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:39.259
I almost forgot that she married a homeless man.

59
00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:42.259
No point going bankrupt over a painting.

60
00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:46.449
Well then, how about a bathing war?

61
00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:48.150
I'll start.

62
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.819
Two million.

63
00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:53.259
Three million.

64
00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:54.259
Ten million.

65
00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:57.740
Can you and Charlotte even come up with that kind of money?

66
00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.900
Ten million.

67
00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.419
Mike, you can't let this joke win.

68
00:03:02.419 --> 00:03:08.210
Charlotte, you realize that price is far beyond the actual value

69
00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:10.210
of this painting.

70
00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:12.210
This painting is worth every penny.

71
00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:23.139
I apologize that you had to experience that.

72
00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:25.139
We will still honor the original pricing.

73
00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:27.939
Thank you so much.

74
00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:29.939
Please, come with me.

75
00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:39.599
Mike and I went to the gallery earlier today and saw Charlotte

76
00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:41.599
and her trash husband.

77
00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:44.599
Yeah, she's been causing a lot of trouble lately.

78
00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:47.599
Dad, we have to do something about her.

79
00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:49.919
I am thinking about it.

80
00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:58.659
Okay.

81
00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:00.659
Having a few drinks, I see.

82
00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:03.949
I should be the one to inherit the Taurus group.

83
00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:06.949
But everyone's so biased towards Charlotte.

84
00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:08.949
If this continues our plans...

85
00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:10.270
Don't worry, baby.

86
00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.270
I've made some arrangements.

87
00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:15.270
By the time we have the next Taurus group shareholders meeting,

88
00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:18.430
Charlotte will be kicked off the board.

89
00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:19.430
Oh, baby.

90
00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.430
You're all I have.

91
00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:32.040
I stayed it in my mother's will.

92
00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.040
Today onward, I will be officially taking over the Taurus group company.

93
00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.040
You have ruined the partnership with the Davis family.

94
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.040
And now you can qualify to run this company.

95
00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:47.040
Look, Charlotte, there is still time for you to fix this, okay?

96
00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.040
You can get rid of your husband, whatever.

97
00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.040
And go apologize to Mike.

98
00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.040
He will forgive you and he will marry you.

99
00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:01.889
Ladies and gentlemen, I have just received something very interesting.

100
00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:05.889
It seems that Mr. Davis is cheating on me with my own cousin.

101
00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:07.529
How ironic.

102
00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:09.529
That is a damn lie.

103
00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:12.529
Anyways, my current marital affairs is a personal matter

104
00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:14.779
and has nothing to do with the company.

105
00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:19.779
I have drafted a new updated work plan, so everyone please take a look.

106
00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:24.779
In more recent years, our revenue and reputation has naturally declined

107
00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:28.779
as a result of practicing conservative development strategies.

108
00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:34.779
Modern art requires us to take constant risks in creating new breakthroughs

109
00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:37.779
and being more open to new concepts.

110
00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:42.490
Charlotte, this plan is too reckless.

111
00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:49.490
They will only take me one year to increase our group's profit by 30%.

112
00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:53.779
If my plan doesn't work, I will voluntarily resign myself.

113
00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:59.740
How can I help you?

114
00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.740
Charlotte, you know very well

115
00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:07.740
that with the company as it stands right now, we cannot support your plan.

116
00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:12.740
It has been difficult enough this past year losing that partnership with Mike's family.

117
00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:17.000
Don't worry about it, Uncle. I'm the CEO of this company now.

118
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.129
You are as arrogant and smug as your insufferable mother.

119
00:06:23.129 --> 00:06:25.959
Are you going to get that divorce or not?

120
00:06:25.959 --> 00:06:29.250
I love my husband dearly.

121
00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:36.680
All right, then from this moment on, you have lost an uncle

122
00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:41.870
and this family is completely cutting ties with you.

123
00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:43.319
Good luck to you.

124
00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:54.259
Happy birthday to you.

125
00:06:54.259 --> 00:07:27.060
Charlotte, what happened? Are you all right?

126
00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:30.060
I am good to send me and cut off every ties with me.

127
00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:32.769
I have no family left.

128
00:07:32.769 --> 00:07:36.180
That's not true. You still have me.

129
00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:43.379
And this. Welcome home, Charlotte.

130
00:07:43.379 --> 00:08:04.889
Hungry?

131
00:08:04.889 --> 00:08:16.689
How did you get that video of Mike and Elle at the bar?

132
00:08:16.689 --> 00:08:18.689
Oh, that. I am...

133
00:08:18.689 --> 00:08:25.420
Well, I actually work there part-time and accidentally happens to record it.

134
00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:27.420
You're working multiple jobs?

135
00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:29.420
No. I was just a...

136
00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:33.100
I just happened to be there to pick up my last paycheck.

137
00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:38.129
I see. Look, you have a formal job now, so no need to work part-time.

138
00:08:38.129 --> 00:08:41.429
Yes.

139
00:08:41.429 --> 00:08:50.179
Is this the best your team can offer?

140
00:08:50.179 --> 00:08:52.220
Please don't be upset, sir.

141
00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:54.220
Allow me to explain the concept for this piece.

142
00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:56.220
Oh, what I have an issue with is not the presentation.

143
00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:59.220
What I have an issue with is the concept.

144
00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:03.220
If your team cannot come up with something today that needs my expectations,

145
00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:06.309
then I'm going to have to think my business elsewhere.

146
00:09:06.309 --> 00:09:08.409
Hello, Charlie.

147
00:09:08.409 --> 00:09:10.500
I couldn't help but over here.

148
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:14.500
I completely understand that you're a significant way to magnify the painting's concept

149
00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:17.500
and to take the elite art scene by storm.

150
00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:21.500
We are quite fortunate to exhibit this piece due to its innovative ways of

151
00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:23.500
experienced cultural installations.

152
00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:27.600
Well, breaking this facial relationship does sound intriguing.

153
00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:35.110
Artists now have the opportunity to redefine the meaning and the concept of painting.

154
00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:40.110
And we promise that your art gallery in Las Vegas will become a cultural and

155
00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:41.110
monumental landmark.

156
00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:53.019
I don't know what I'm going to do.

157
00:09:53.019 --> 00:09:55.019
I don't have time to scout for a new artist.

158
00:09:55.019 --> 00:09:57.019
I can join you and keep you company.

159
00:09:57.019 --> 00:09:58.090
That's so sweet.

160
00:09:58.090 --> 00:10:03.940
Well, the new discovery is having a party tonight.

161
00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:06.940
Brother, your wife is right behind you.

162
00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:09.970
And I have to secure a partnership with the white jewelry group.

163
00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:15.970
We're too close to the tourist group company.

164
00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:17.970
Let's go and meet at my home.

165
00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:19.970
Maybe you can call me honey.

166
00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:21.970
Shut up, 007.

167
00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:25.950
What's wrong?

168
00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:29.519
I thought I saw someone.

169
00:10:29.519 --> 00:10:32.480
Must not begin to sleep.

170
00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:33.480
Hurry up, baby!

171
00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:37.340
You don't trust me!

172
00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:46.149
Go from the art gallery.

173
00:10:46.149 --> 00:10:48.220
What are you doing here?

174
00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:50.820
Is your boyfriend my husband?

175
00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:53.820
No, my boyfriend is a handsome hottie.

176
00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:54.820
Definitely not him.

177
00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:58.820
Okay, please tell me that this is a famous understanding.

178
00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:01.820
These guys like my gay little brother.

179
00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:02.820
Nothing more.

180
00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:03.820
Nothing less.

181
00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:06.210
Oh shit!

182
00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:11.210
It's gotten really late and my poor boyfriend, he's still waiting on me.

183
00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:12.210
I really have to go.

184
00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:15.899
Good night, everyone.

185
00:11:15.899 --> 00:11:21.009
Well, he is a cutie.

186
00:11:21.009 --> 00:11:23.009
Have you ever had a crush on him?

187
00:11:23.009 --> 00:11:24.009
I'll hope.

188
00:11:24.009 --> 00:11:25.009
Henry.

189
00:11:25.009 --> 00:11:27.870
I swear, he's like a brother to me.

190
00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:32.980
By the way, we have a fancy party tonight.

191
00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:34.980
I'm going to need you to dress up.

192
00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:37.490
Your wish is my command.

193
00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:46.509
So, tonight is a huge celebration for the music gallery.

194
00:11:46.509 --> 00:11:49.509
We're going to be meeting very big artists.

195
00:11:49.509 --> 00:11:52.509
I'm hoping to secure a partnership with the white jewelry group.

196
00:11:52.509 --> 00:11:54.509
The white jewelry group?

197
00:11:54.509 --> 00:12:00.980
Put your hand down.

198
00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:02.980
What are you being so shy about?

199
00:12:06.289 --> 00:12:07.580
Charlotte.

200
00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:09.580
What a pleasant surprise to see you.

201
00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:11.580
Do you also work with the white jewelry group?

202
00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:13.580
Yes, in fact I do.

203
00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:15.580
Used gallery is funded by the white jewelry group.

204
00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:18.990
It happens to be one of the projects I'm in charge of.

205
00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:24.230
Come say hello, what are you doing?

206
00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:27.230
Um, if the white jewelry group needs any event planning,

207
00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:31.230
the tourist group will be honored to collaborate.

208
00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:32.230
Of course.

209
00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:35.230
Let me introduce you to some of my partners from the white jewelry group.

210
00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:43.899
Why was another informed of this celebration today?

211
00:12:43.899 --> 00:12:44.899
I was going to tell you.

212
00:12:44.899 --> 00:12:46.899
But you caught me off guard when you slapped my Bible.

213
00:12:46.899 --> 00:12:48.899
Oh, I'm sorry.

214
00:12:48.899 --> 00:12:49.899
You know what to do, right?

215
00:12:49.899 --> 00:12:51.899
I've already taken care of the arrangements.

216
00:12:51.899 --> 00:12:52.899
Just go keep your wife company.

217
00:12:52.899 --> 00:12:58.230
And Sydney, I want you to meet my assistant Jackson.

218
00:12:58.230 --> 00:12:59.230
Assistant?

219
00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:01.230
Yes, there is correct.

220
00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:03.230
Assistant.

221
00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:07.330
I am the current assistant of the president of the tourist group company.

222
00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:15.899
Um, I remember when Jackson used to work at the Muse Gallery.

223
00:13:15.899 --> 00:13:17.899
He's a very hardworking young man.

224
00:13:17.899 --> 00:13:22.899
Well, I've heard that the white jewelry group is currently looking for new partners.

225
00:13:22.899 --> 00:13:28.899
We would be honored to have an opportunity to show you guys what tourist group can offer.

226
00:13:28.899 --> 00:13:34.899
That being said, I'm aware that the Davis group is vying for a partnership with the white jewelry group.

227
00:13:34.899 --> 00:13:35.899
Of course, of course.

228
00:13:35.899 --> 00:13:39.899
Partnership with the tourist group is a huge key project for us this year.

229
00:13:39.899 --> 00:13:40.899
Oh, wait.

230
00:13:40.899 --> 00:13:41.899
Yes.

231
00:13:41.899 --> 00:13:42.899
Yes.

232
00:13:42.899 --> 00:13:47.899
As long as you're willing to agree to finalize, this partnership could move forward to the next phase.

233
00:13:47.899 --> 00:13:52.899
Moreover, this project happens to be led by Henry himself.

234
00:13:52.899 --> 00:13:54.899
Oh, well, then it's settled.

235
00:13:54.899 --> 00:13:56.899
Can we sign a contract tomorrow?

236
00:13:56.899 --> 00:13:57.899
Wow.

237
00:13:57.899 --> 00:13:58.899
This is really fast.

238
00:13:58.899 --> 00:13:59.899
Tomorrow.

239
00:13:59.899 --> 00:14:00.899
Yes.

240
00:14:00.899 --> 00:14:01.899
Tomorrow.

241
00:14:01.899 --> 00:14:02.899
We'll sign the deal tomorrow.

242
00:14:02.899 --> 00:14:09.899
Cheers to the newfound partnership.

243
00:14:09.899 --> 00:14:12.899
Successful partnership.

244
00:14:12.899 --> 00:14:13.899
Cheers.

245
00:14:13.899 --> 00:14:14.899
Cheers.

246
00:14:15.899 --> 00:14:18.899
It's been a while since I've drunk this much.

247
00:14:18.899 --> 00:14:30.049
What's your secret?

248
00:14:30.049 --> 00:14:40.240
My secret is that I've actually always loved you.

249
00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:41.240
You're so drunk right now.

250
00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:42.240
You don't know what you're saying.

251
00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:47.509
Charlotte, I've always loved just you.

252
00:14:47.509 --> 00:15:05.700
You two seriously think you can sign a deal with the white family?

253
00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:13.740
Unfortunately for you, Mr. White and I happen to be very close friend.

254
00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:18.740
What you're saying is that you're close friends with the president of the white jewelry group.

255
00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:19.740
That's right.

256
00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:22.740
Mr. Davis, please wait in the reception room.

257
00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:25.600
Farewell, suckers.

258
00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:27.600
I'm going to get my contract signed.

259
00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:29.600
If you both please follow me.

260
00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:34.620
Henry has been expecting the two of you.

261
00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:38.620
Before I sign, why don't I first give you a tour over the company?

262
00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:58.370
Sure.

263
00:15:58.370 --> 00:15:59.370
Yeah.

264
00:15:59.370 --> 00:16:00.370
Your coffee?

265
00:16:00.370 --> 00:16:02.370
When will your boss see me?

266
00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:22.330
He'll see you after you finish drinking your coffee.

267
00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:30.169
So, you are the president of the white jewelry group?

268
00:16:30.169 --> 00:16:38.379
I really prefer to keep a low profile.

269
00:16:38.379 --> 00:16:40.379
I'm one who enjoys their privacy.

270
00:16:40.379 --> 00:16:45.169
That's completely understandable.

271
00:16:45.169 --> 00:16:49.169
Well, I wish us both a successful and fulfilling partnership.

272
00:16:49.169 --> 00:16:52.169
Too successful and fulfilling partnership.

273
00:16:52.169 --> 00:16:55.169
Did you end up having a meeting with your close friend, Mr. White?

274
00:16:55.169 --> 00:17:10.359
Well, we are definitely going down the road.

275
00:17:10.359 --> 00:17:11.359
Mr. White?

276
00:17:11.359 --> 00:17:14.359
Well, we are definitely going to have a joint partnership soon.

277
00:17:14.359 --> 00:17:19.359
We are only one signature away from a closed, done deal.

278
00:17:19.359 --> 00:17:24.359
I suppose you two got rejected, which is why Charlotte's trying to run away so quick.

279
00:17:24.359 --> 00:17:26.359
Well, I hope you enjoy waiting.

280
00:17:26.359 --> 00:17:42.190
You just sealed a partnership with the white jewelry group.

281
00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:44.930
Damn, you useless fool.

282
00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:48.269
This cannot be happening.

283
00:17:48.269 --> 00:17:49.269
Cheers.

284
00:17:49.269 --> 00:17:55.099
Charlotte speaking?

285
00:17:55.099 --> 00:17:56.460
Charlotte, don't you think?

286
00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:58.460
The signing of contract changes anything.

287
00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:00.490
You will not have your way.

288
00:18:00.490 --> 00:18:07.759
Hello everyone.

289
00:18:07.759 --> 00:18:12.789
I'd just like to announce that the Torah's group and the white jewelry group have formed

290
00:18:12.789 --> 00:18:14.789
a wonderful partnership.

291
00:18:14.789 --> 00:18:20.859
To commemorate this special event, we will be hosting a celebratory party this Friday evening.

292
00:18:20.859 --> 00:18:31.220
Everyone is invited and all welcome to the tent.

293
00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:32.220
Come with me.

294
00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:33.220
But I haven't finished my work yet.

295
00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:34.220
Back and wait.

296
00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:36.339
Yes, come on.

297
00:18:36.339 --> 00:18:46.579
When are you going to get divorced?

298
00:18:46.579 --> 00:18:48.579
Why are you all about my business?

299
00:18:48.579 --> 00:18:50.579
Mom, I'm all up in your business.

300
00:18:50.579 --> 00:18:55.579
Because you don't seem to understand how much we struggle due to your negligent behavior

301
00:18:55.579 --> 00:19:00.579
and how difficult it is going to be moving forward with any future projects with the Davis family.

302
00:19:00.579 --> 00:19:04.579
We just secured a partnership with the white jewelry group.

303
00:19:04.579 --> 00:19:08.579
I single-handedly fixed our company's problems and now we're planning his party to celebrate.

304
00:19:08.579 --> 00:19:10.279
Shut up.

305
00:19:10.279 --> 00:19:14.279
None of this would have happened if you weren't so stubborn in the first place.

306
00:19:14.279 --> 00:19:18.279
Well, Mr. Torres, I'm going to have to ask you to step aside.

307
00:19:18.279 --> 00:19:22.279
I have a meeting with the project leader of the white jewelry group and I can't keep him waiting.

308
00:19:22.279 --> 00:19:38.329
I don't close your eyes.

309
00:19:38.329 --> 00:19:44.329
Well, since tomorrow is the party over the Torres group and it's your first public appearance as the acting CEO,

310
00:19:44.329 --> 00:19:47.329
I decided to give you a little something.

311
00:19:47.329 --> 00:20:04.589
We're fake jewelry, dear cousin.

312
00:20:04.589 --> 00:20:10.589
Everyone knows this was designed by the renowned international jewelry designer Fiona.

313
00:20:10.589 --> 00:20:12.589
It's worth hundreds of millions of dollars.

314
00:20:12.589 --> 00:20:14.589
Yours can't be real.

315
00:20:14.589 --> 00:20:18.589
Designer Fiona is the wife of one of the top shareholders of the Torres group.

316
00:20:18.589 --> 00:20:21.589
She'll be making my parents tonight.

317
00:20:21.589 --> 00:20:23.589
And how does that concern you?

318
00:20:23.589 --> 00:20:32.900
Apparently, we're got out that you married homeless and causing our stock prices to fall.

319
00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:37.759
This resulted in some very angry shareholders.

320
00:20:37.759 --> 00:20:39.759
What a lovely young woman.

321
00:20:39.759 --> 00:20:42.759
Oh my God, it's Fiona.

322
00:20:42.759 --> 00:20:46.759
Grab your popcorn, everyone, the show's about to start.
