1
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:10,210
Mom, Dad, can a love that began with the lie truly last?

2
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:18,989
Surely.

3
00:00:18,989 --> 00:00:23,890
Charlotte, I'm so sorry to have lied to you.

4
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:26,910
That's all my fault.

5
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:31,910
For safety reasons, my family has this tradition where the air must hide his identity.

6
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:37,390
That's how we protect ourselves from kidnappers, gold diggers, and other animals.

7
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:43,390
I swear to God, and to your parents, that I will cherish you, protect you,

8
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:46,390
and be the family you come home to each day.

9
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:50,679
Please, give me another chance. Let me make it out.

10
00:00:50,679 --> 00:01:30,549
Okay, one more chance. What's happening?

11
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:34,549
Nothing, Charlotte. Just hold down to her seatbelt and close your eyes.
