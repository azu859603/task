1
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:06,599
My dear cousin, how are you?

2
00:00:06,599 --> 00:00:08,240
Fine, how about you?

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,679
In prison yet?

4
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:11,359
Very funny.

5
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:13,720
Anyways, I'm showcasing an exhibit

6
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,679
I would love to invite both you

7
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:18,160
and Mr. White to my opening party.

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,670
We'll both be there.

9
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:23,829
Something doesn't feel right.

10
00:00:23,829 --> 00:00:25,589
I'm worried about your safety.

11
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:27,600
I feel the same way.

12
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,000
I've always had this horrible feeling

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,079
that my parents were murdered,

14
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:31,160
and after this car accident,

15
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,719
I just can't, even though the police

16
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:35,880
didn't find anything in my parents' eyes,

17
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,100
I can't help but think Ella might be involved.

18
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,500
Henry!

19
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,020
Give me names of all the founders

20
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,740
listed on their Ella's Gallery

21
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:47,579
and see who she's been in contact with recently.

22
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:48,820
You've got a boss.
