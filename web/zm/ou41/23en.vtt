The canvas used in this painting looks cheap, the brushstrokes lack finesse, and the color palette uses tonally pop.

2
00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:10.640
Strange.

3
00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.019
It's a color set.

4
00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:18.649
It looks like Henry's investigation spot on.

5
00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.480
Charlotte, I heard that yesterday was the anniversary of your parents passing.

6
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.480
How are you feeling?

7
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.480
I'm fine. That's good.

8
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.479
So what do you think of Ella's Gallery? Huh? Pretty amazing.

9
00:00:35.429 --> 00:00:40.939
If Charlotte wanted to, I could buy this whole gallery within seconds.

10
00:00:40.939 --> 00:00:46.939
Mr. Wright, if you would like, I could have Ella transfer this entire gallery to you. Right away.
