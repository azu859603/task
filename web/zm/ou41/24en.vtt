What the hell is wrong with you bringing up Charlotte's parents' death right now?

2
00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:05.780
Are you crazy?

3
00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:06.780
I didn't mean to.

4
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:08.779
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:08.779 --> 00:00:12.349
Charlotte, just you wait.

6
00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:15.349
I have something special planned for you.

7
00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:16.800
Hello, everyone.

8
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.800
Let's now welcome our gallery manager, Ella.

9
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.539
Sorry to cut in, everyone.

10
00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:27.539
I'd love to make a toast to my cousin.

11
00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.539
Ella, you did such a fantastic job.

12
00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.979
I cannot believe that every piece of art in your gallery is a counterfeit.

13
00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:37.979
Do you enjoy money laundering?

14
00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:39.979
Charlotte, what are you doing?

15
00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:42.979
How did my parents really die?

16
00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:45.979
Say it or I'll report your gallery to the press.

17
00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:47.780
I'm gonna kill you!
