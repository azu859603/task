1
00:00:10,539 --> 00:00:13,410
This is all that she's Charlotte's fault.

2
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:15,660
Come to my gallery opening.

3
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:23,320
Give me a try to force me to reveal the truth about her dead parent.

4
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,239
Did you?

5
00:00:25,239 --> 00:00:28,570
Don't you worry, sweetheart.

6
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:38,130
I'm going to take care of everything.

7
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:40,200
She's been for so much.

8
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,479
I finally got her to sleep.

9
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:43,880
How's the investigation going?

10
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,479
The poor state that the dust weren't oxidant,

11
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:47,960
but we're still looking at different sources

12
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,159
and should have more information

13
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:51,159
within the next couple of days.
