00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,720
Thank you for your hard work.

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:14,060
You can head back that.

3
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:16,059
Hey, how are you feeling?

4
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:18,059
I'm fine. I need to head out to the gallery.

5
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:22,059
Our collaborators will be stopping by to have a visit.

6
00:00:22,059 --> 00:00:24,350
Charlotte, I'm worried about you.

7
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:27,469
Sorry, Jackson.

8
00:00:27,469 --> 00:00:37,060
I'm just thankful to have you.

9
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,060
I'll pick it up after you finish your work.

10
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:41,179
I have a little surprise waiting for you.

11
00:00:41,179 --> 00:00:49,840
Okay.

12
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,840
Would you happen to be Miss Charlotte Torres?

13
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,960
Yes, it's me.

14
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,960
Please follow me.

15
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,960
There happens to be a special surprise

16
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,960
in the trunk prepared just for you.

17
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,880
This must be what Jackson was talking about.
