00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.209
Please, you don't have to do this.

2
00:00:03.209 --> 00:00:05.209
Even if you kill me, I've already changed the will,

3
00:00:05.209 --> 00:00:08.210
giving all my possessions to charity.

4
00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.980
However, I'm willing to make you an offer.

5
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.980
In exchange for the tourist group,

6
00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.699
I only request the truth.

7
00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.980
Tell me, how did my parents really die?

8
00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:31.679
The truth is your parents died in a car accident.

9
00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.679
Did you tamper with the car?

10
00:00:33.679 --> 00:00:36.679
Why did the authorities rule their death as an accident?

11
00:00:36.679 --> 00:00:40.679
I merely removed a few tiny screws,

12
00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:46.969
which may have caused their vehicle to lose control.

13
00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:50.320
I like what just happened to you and Jackson.

14
00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.320
Isn't that right?

15
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.789
You monster!

16
00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:55.789
You know what?

17
00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:57.789
Now that the cat's out of the bag,

18
00:00:57.789 --> 00:00:59.789
let's just move this along.

19
00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.079
It's time for you to die.

20
00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:05.079
You spent your whole life leeching off my parents,

21
00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:08.079
and now I'm giving you the opportunity to have it all.

22
00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:10.780
Are you really willing to get that up?

23
00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:11.879
Think about me a lot.

24
00:01:11.879 --> 00:01:38.109
Are you enjoying your parents in hell?

25
00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:39.109
I'm here.

26
00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:40.430
Oh, thank God you're here.

27
00:01:40.430 --> 00:02:41.669
God, I'm so sorry. I wasn't able to protect you.

28
00:02:41.669 --> 00:02:43.669
Oh, my God, Charlotte, are you okay?

29
00:02:43.669 --> 00:02:45.960
Oh, my God, there was this man next to me.

30
00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.060
Where am I? I want to go home.

31
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:59.539
God, is this her punishment for all the lies I've told?

32
00:02:59.539 --> 00:03:01.539
She suffers from a severe head injury,

33
00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:03.539
caused by a traumatic blow to her head.

34
00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:05.539
This results in an impaired memory,

35
00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:08.539
and an inability to recall key life events that have occurred

36
00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:09.539
during her adulthood.

37
00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:12.539
Luckily, her cognitive areas are functioning normally,

38
00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:14.539
and so should not affect her daily life.

39
00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:19.680
Thank you, doctor.

40
00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.680
I can't believe you're 30.

41
00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.680
You look just how you did in high school.

42
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.780
Really?

43
00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.780
You're 25, and you're still allergic to roses.

44
00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:34.710
Did I inherit the torsker?

45
00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:37.710
You did, and you're doing a killer job running it.

46
00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:46.340
Who is this man?

47
00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.330
Am I here?

48
00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.330
How did I inherit the torsker?

49
00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.610
Please tell me everything.

50
00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.610
I don't know everything that just happened right now,

51
00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.120
but I guess if we start from the top,

52
00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.120
you suffered from a severe accident recently,

53
00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.120
and the doctor told me that you're doing okay,

54
00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:12.120
so I should be able to recover pretty swiftly.

55
00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.610
Charlotte, you still need more rest.

56
00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:19.610
Move aside, I figured everything out.

57
00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:21.610
I need to move my mother's valuables out of the Torah's house

58
00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:22.610
as soon as possible.

59
00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:51.339
You're supposed to be in the hospital resting.

60
00:04:51.339 --> 00:04:53.879
The valuables are to the right.

61
00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:59.269
What's going on here, Charlotte?

62
00:04:59.269 --> 00:05:04.470
Charlotte, this is your home.

63
00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.470
Uncle, ever since you and your family moved in,

64
00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.790
I no longer had a home.

65
00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:27.540
I wish I hadn't raised you. You are an ungrateful bitch.

66
00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:41.120
You okay?

67
00:05:41.120 --> 00:06:10.519
I just didn't expect to feel as sad.

68
00:06:10.519 --> 00:06:11.519
Charlotte, you're back.

69
00:06:11.519 --> 00:06:14.540
I think we need to talk.

70
00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:15.540
Are you hungry, thirsty?

71
00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:16.540
I can order something.

72
00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:19.540
No, Jackson, I need to tell you something.

73
00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:28.740
I'm gonna file for a divorce.

74
00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:29.899
I got what I needed.

75
00:06:29.899 --> 00:06:31.899
My aunt, uncle, no longer threatened me,

76
00:06:31.899 --> 00:06:35.350
and we don't need to put this act up anymore.

77
00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:39.439
I need you to move out as soon as you can.

78
00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:42.899
Move out?

79
00:06:42.899 --> 00:06:44.350
I'm your husband.

80
00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:46.670
I know you don't remember me.

81
00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:51.959
You're like this.

82
00:06:51.959 --> 00:07:58.250
It feels so sad, but why?

83
00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:36.629
Did you want to say something?

84
00:08:36.629 --> 00:08:37.629
I made a promise here.

85
00:08:37.629 --> 00:08:39.629
She got into your parents.

86
00:08:39.629 --> 00:08:44.009
I just wanted to know how much I would cherish and care for you.

87
00:08:44.009 --> 00:08:47.009
And provide you with a loving home.

88
00:08:47.009 --> 00:08:49.330
Charlotte, I love you.

89
00:08:49.330 --> 00:09:23.039
Charlotte!

90
00:09:23.039 --> 00:09:39.059
Charlotte, is this all?

91
00:09:39.059 --> 00:09:43.059
You know, you were a lot nicer before ever gaining memory back.

92
00:09:43.059 --> 00:09:49.269
Yeah, and you know, I almost became that guy from 51st States movie.

93
00:09:49.269 --> 00:09:53.929
I promise I'll take care of myself.

94
00:09:53.929 --> 00:10:07.009
What exactly did you want to show me?

95
00:10:07.009 --> 00:10:10.679
Proof of my love for you, from all these years.

96
00:10:10.679 --> 00:10:16.740
Where did you get this photo?

97
00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:18.250
Yeah.

98
00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:20.250
I got it out for my high school year book.

99
00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:47.330
LaTaurus, will you do the honor and marry me again?

100
00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:51.330
Jackson, do you take Charlotte to be your lawfully wedded wife?

101
00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:55.360
For richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health?

102
00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:56.360
I do.

103
00:10:56.360 --> 00:11:00.360
Charlotte, do you take Jackson to be your lawfully wedded husband?

104
00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:04.389
For richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health?

105
00:11:04.389 --> 00:11:05.389
I do.
