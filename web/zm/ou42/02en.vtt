00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:15.910
Good morning, ma'am.

2
00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:22.780
You know why I'm here, Jack.

3
00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.780
Where is the one I asked you to find?

4
00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.780
Ma'am, I'm doing everything I can, however.

5
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.780
I have yet to find a trace of him.

6
00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:30.780
You idiot!

7
00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.780
My son disappeared three years ago.

8
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.479
You are responsible for this city.

9
00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:39.479
Do you have a nerve to stand here and tell me that after three years,

10
00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:42.479
you haven't been able to find a single clue?

11
00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:44.479
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

12
00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:48.509
Remember, Leo is not just the heir to the foreign family.

13
00:00:48.509 --> 00:00:51.509
He is the heir to the entire brand or legacy.

14
00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:55.509
Do you know what that family represents?

15
00:00:55.509 --> 00:01:00.020
They are the hidden leaders of our nation's iconic.

16
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:05.180
If you find him, you have a splendid, clear head of you.

17
00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.180
If you don't, you have nothing.

18
00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.180
Understand?

19
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.180
No matter where he is, I will find your son.

20
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.180
I swear on my name.

21
00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.180
I, Jack Dyson, will find Mr. Leo Brandor.

22
00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.180
I'll do whatever it takes, you have my word.

23
00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:32.200
Whatever it takes.

24
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.810
Excuse me, are you with the Dorn group?

25
00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.099
Yes, how can I help you?

26
00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:40.099
I was wondering if the medical charity program is still active?

27
00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:44.099
I submitted an application a few months ago and I haven't heard back yet.

28
00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:47.129
The updates are posted online, check there.

29
00:01:47.129 --> 00:01:51.129
Oh, I have, there haven't been any updates.

30
00:01:51.129 --> 00:01:54.959
Please, sir, I've traveled a really long way to just be here.

31
00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:57.959
I mean, could you just spare a moment to discuss this with me?
