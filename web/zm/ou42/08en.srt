1
00:00:10,029 --> 00:00:12,029
My god, Leo, you're awake!

2
00:00:12,029 --> 00:00:15,250
I must be saying things!

3
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:17,250
I can't believe this.

4
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,250
I mean, Divina's the useless boyfriend actually woke up.

5
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:21,500
Oh, Leo?

6
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,879
Divina!

7
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:27,809
You're awake?

8
00:00:27,809 --> 00:00:36,880
Uh...

9
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,140
You're a big jerk.

10
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:42,899
What took you so long?

11
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:45,219
I know, Divina.

12
00:00:45,219 --> 00:00:53,340
I had something to wake out and stream these past three years.

13
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,340
I tried to wake up with all my strength.

14
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:01,759
No idea how much I missed you.

15
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:05,840
That much I loved you.

16
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:17,980
Thanks.

17
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:20,709
The tears are all my fault.

18
00:01:20,709 --> 00:01:25,769
Each one is pierced straight through my heart.

19
00:01:25,769 --> 00:01:28,340
Gosh, everything can do well for you.

20
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:35,060
The most precious thing for you in the whole world.

21
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,420
It's not your fault.

22
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:43,909
Leo, I have never regretted waiting for you.

23
00:01:43,909 --> 00:01:47,489
You never regretted anything for you.

24
00:01:47,489 --> 00:01:49,489
I've missed you so much.
