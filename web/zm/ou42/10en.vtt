00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.040
Leo, my Leo is back.

2
00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.400
Congratulations, ma'am. He found you.

3
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.400
It seems he's been in a coma for three years.

4
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.400
And a girl has been taking care of it in the whole time.

5
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.400
That girl must be an angel.

6
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.399
Prepare the car immediately.

7
00:00:17.399 --> 00:00:19.750
I need to see them now.

8
00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:20.750
Yes, ma'am.

9
00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:26.039
Claude.

10
00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:33.530
Our Leo. Our Leo is back.

11
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:34.530
My son.

12
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.530
The heir of the Brandore Group.

13
00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.530
He is back.

14
00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.530
God bless Brandore.

15
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.299
Prepare the car.

16
00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:46.100
I'm headed to Memphis.

17
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.100
Brandore, the first commander of the Brandore Group.

18
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.100
The private security team here to ensure you're safe.

19
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.100
July sports are safe.

20
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.100
Yes.

21
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.100
Let's go.

22
00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:01.060
Ha ha ha.

23
00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.060
Look, he called this mommy.

24
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.060
Look at your parents are dirt and corn.

25
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.060
Just a few.

26
00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.060
Let me guess.

27
00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.060
Mommy sells roadside flowers and your dad shines shoes.

28
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.060
All right.

29
00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.060
Yeah, enough.

30
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.060
Enough.

31
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.060
Devina, let's go.

32
00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.060
Come on.

33
00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.060
My father is the manager of the Memphis Thorn.

34
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.060
If any of you want to come and invent this again, you'll have to ask me.

35
00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.060
Wait, did you say that you and your father worked for this laundry?

36
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.060
That's right.

37
00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.060
Yeah.

38
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.060
You scared?

39
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.060
No.

40
00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.120
If I wanted to have you killed, all I'd have to do is left a thing.
