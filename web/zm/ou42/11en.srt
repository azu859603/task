1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:07,900
Do you have any idea what you're saying?

2
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:11,300
We're going to kill you.

3
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,300
Kill me.

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,300
Are you off your meds?

5
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:17,420
You really think working for the thorn group is that impressive.

6
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:21,339
My background is way more impressive than that.

7
00:00:21,339 --> 00:00:22,339
Yeah.

8
00:00:22,339 --> 00:00:23,339
You piece of shit.

9
00:00:23,339 --> 00:00:26,539
Like the thorn group would have anything to do with trash like you.

10
00:00:26,539 --> 00:00:31,179
I'm going to count to three if you don't get your little ass over here and kneel in

11
00:00:31,179 --> 00:00:33,820
front of me and Divina and apologize.

12
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:40,020
I'll send you to hell.

13
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,020
Three.

14
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:42,579
So you can't talk to me.

15
00:00:42,579 --> 00:00:44,579
You can't talk to me like that.

16
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:48,850
You piece of shit.

17
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:50,369
Guys, gifts are ready.

18
00:00:50,369 --> 00:00:51,369
Good.

19
00:00:51,369 --> 00:00:53,289
Mr. Leo is back.

20
00:00:53,289 --> 00:00:57,329
He met an angelic girl who took care of him all these years.

21
00:00:57,329 --> 00:00:59,049
Let's go welcome them back.

22
00:00:59,049 --> 00:01:15,780
Ma'am, Jack Dyson has already gone to welcome Leo.

23
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,219
It'll take about an hour to get to his address.

24
00:01:18,219 --> 00:01:21,180
I'll tell the driver to take the thorn express highway.

25
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,780
I need to be there in 30 minutes.

26
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:33,319
Jack Ma'am.

27
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:35,120
Homie, you still got some fight left, huh?

28
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,120
Fuck it.

29
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,120
I got no use for you.

30
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:44,260
Wait!

31
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:45,260
Look, we're such an idiot.

32
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:46,260
It's an honor to be with Mr. Josa.

33
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:49,260
Why do you have to bring everyone down for your useless boyfriend?

34
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:51,060
Go with Mr. Josa.

35
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,060
No.

36
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:54,250
It's like going to be him.

37
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,250
Is it me?

38
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,730
I'm going to excuse him.

39
00:01:57,730 --> 00:01:59,730
Is his dead dog over me?

40
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:01,930
I'm going to take your girl right in front of you.

41
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:02,959
What?

42
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:03,959
No, he won't touch me.

43
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:06,540
Listen up, shitface.

44
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,419
Touch her again and you'll regret everything.

45
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:11,419
What the fuck do you think you are?

46
00:02:11,419 --> 00:02:14,020
My father is the manager at the thorn group.

47
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,219
You're going to wish you were still in that coma.

48
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:18,020
I'm your deputy manager.

49
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,409
You think that's impressive?

50
00:02:20,409 --> 00:02:26,750
What I think is you keep talking shit and you're going to find my foot up your ass.

51
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:30,750
Kiss my ass to fucking arrogant freak.

52
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,750
Say it again.

53
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:32,750
Say it again!

54
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:53,870
You cripple after I take your girl and blow your fucking head off.

55
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,870
Who's header you planning to blow off?

56
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:58,919
Stay nice.

57
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:04,620
Head of the Memphis stone group.

58
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,319
I'm a person.

59
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:08,319
The ear.

60
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:09,319
Jack Dyson?

61
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:11,020
Mr. Jack.

62
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,310
May I bring number?

63
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:16,650
No.

64
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:17,650
Mr. Dyson.

65
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:18,650
A long time no see.

66
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:20,800
What's the occasion?

67
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,819
Mom?

68
00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:23,819
Dad?

69
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:24,819
What are you doing here?

70
00:03:24,819 --> 00:03:28,819
Well, we came with Mr. Dyson to welcome the heir of the thorn group.

71
00:03:28,819 --> 00:03:29,819
Why you here?

72
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:31,819
The heir of the thorn group.

73
00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:33,819
There's no pawns here.

74
00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:34,819
This is just me.

75
00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:37,819
Look at these leaves and this broke back loser in the chair.

76
00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:38,819
Mr.

77
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:41,550
Leo.

78
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:44,379
Sir, you know him?

79
00:03:44,379 --> 00:03:46,379
He does not deserve your attention.

80
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:47,379
Respect me.

81
00:03:47,379 --> 00:03:48,379
Shut up Joseph.

82
00:03:48,379 --> 00:03:51,379
I did not expect you to get in such trouble.

83
00:03:51,379 --> 00:03:57,689
Ok.

84
00:03:57,689 --> 00:04:03,879
I'm long in trouble.

85
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:04,879
Ma'am.

86
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,300
Sir.

87
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,300
I am very sorry.

88
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:13,840
Sir, why are you bound to him?

89
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,840
Mr. Dyson.

90
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,840
Bailey's are all fools.

91
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,839
That man in the wheelchair.

92
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,839
There's nothing but a crippled beggar with only a court to his name.

93
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,839
You must have the wrong person.

94
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,000
Yeah, he's right boss.

95
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
These nasty people don't deserve your respect.

96
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
If they're nasty people, what does that make you?

97
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,149
A dirty piece of shit?

98
00:04:32,149 --> 00:04:36,060
Boss?

99
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:43,420
As general manager of the Memphis thorn group, I offer my sincerest blessings to Mr. Leo.

100
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:46,740
The esteemed heir of the thorn group.

101
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,740
Welcome home Mr. Leo.

102
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:51,980
Welcome home Mr. Leo.

103
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:52,980
Kevin?

104
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:57,220
Did I hear that right?

105
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:00,220
That's the heir in the thorn group.

106
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,220
This will ripple Leo.

107
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,610
What?

108
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:04,610
Jim?

109
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:05,610
I'm having a nightmare.

110
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:06,610
This?

111
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,740
The heir in the thorn group?

112
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,740
This guy?

113
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:10,740
Shut up Joseph.

114
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:13,740
You have seriously messed up.

115
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:14,740
No.

116
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:15,740
No.

117
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:20,800
No way.

118
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,800
Mr. Vina, I am such an idiot for declining your application.

119
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,120
I feel ashamed of my arrogance and foolish ignorance.

120
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,120
Please forgive me.

121
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,850
I'm not sure I understand what's actually going on.

122
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:41,339
Leo, are you the heir?

123
00:05:41,339 --> 00:05:46,470
I know I should have told you sooner, but I just didn't want to scare you away.

124
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:47,470
This is crazy.

125
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:50,470
Leo, Dabina has done so much for you.

126
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:52,600
You have to cherish her.

127
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,139
Of course Daniel and Bill, you have my work.

128
00:05:56,139 --> 00:06:00,009
And you and the important.

129
00:06:00,009 --> 00:06:03,009
And everyone here who has helped take care of me.

130
00:06:03,009 --> 00:06:08,009
I will make sure that your lives are easy and that you have everything that you want in the world.

131
00:06:08,009 --> 00:06:10,670
Especially.

132
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:13,699
Now Jack, I don't imagine you came here empty-handed.

133
00:06:13,699 --> 00:06:16,060
Show them the gifts.

134
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,060
Yes sir.

135
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:31,439
A gold mine in South Africa with gold reserves of two million ounces.

136
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:33,439
The value of assessment?

137
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:35,439
Over five billion.

138
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:38,660
Now we present it to the dear Mr. Vina.

139
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:50,610
Jesus, billion dollar gold mine.

140
00:06:50,610 --> 00:07:01,139
I'm sorry.

141
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:03,139
I don't think I understand.

142
00:07:03,139 --> 00:07:04,300
That's the line from Lucinda.

143
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,370
I don't say anything.

144
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:07,370
Yeah.

145
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:09,370
Ladies and gentlemen, no need to make a fuss.

146
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:13,370
These are just small tokens of sincerity from the Thorne Group.

147
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:15,370
There are many more gifts to come.

148
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:26,120
Is that the legendary?

149
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,279
The Musaev Red Diamond.

150
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,279
And Patek Philip Ladies Watch.

151
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:35,279
Master Kelly designed and forged it with great care.

152
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:37,279
It is a symbol of status.

153
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:41,600
A one-of-a-kind gift we present to Mr. Vina.

154
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,889
Noah!

155
00:07:42,889 --> 00:07:44,339
Vina get that!

156
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:46,339
The Red Diamond.

157
00:07:46,339 --> 00:07:48,459
It's the Red Diamond.

158
00:07:48,459 --> 00:07:50,459
Oh my God!

159
00:07:50,459 --> 00:07:51,459
No, Chris!

160
00:07:51,459 --> 00:07:52,459
Don't do this!

161
00:07:52,459 --> 00:07:54,459
Do you like these gifts, Devina?

162
00:07:54,459 --> 00:07:57,589
These are far too expensive.

163
00:07:57,589 --> 00:08:01,589
Leo, we understand your intentions, but these gifts are way too expensive.

164
00:08:01,589 --> 00:08:03,589
We can't accept them.

165
00:08:03,589 --> 00:08:04,589
Don't worry about it.

166
00:08:04,589 --> 00:08:08,589
Nothing in this world is more valuable to me than Devina here.

167
00:08:08,589 --> 00:08:16,420
You waking up is the only gift I need.

168
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:19,310
I'm not wrong.

169
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,310
This isn't the heir.

170
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,310
This isn't the fucking heir.

171
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:22,310
I'm right.

172
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,920
Get him.

173
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,300
You heard the man?

174
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,300
Get him!

175
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:31,660
Oh no!

176
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:32,659
No!

177
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:35,029
Mr. Leo.

178
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:36,029
No.

179
00:08:36,029 --> 00:08:37,029
Listen to me.

180
00:08:37,029 --> 00:08:39,029
It's too late to apologize now.

181
00:08:39,029 --> 00:08:40,350
Go to hell.

182
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:41,350
No!

183
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:42,350
No!

184
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:44,279
To Leo.

185
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:45,279
Mr. Leo.

186
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,279
Wait!

187
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:50,450
Wait!

188
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:51,450
Wait!

189
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:52,450
Mr. Leo.

190
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:53,450
Joseph didn't mean he didn't mean to offend you.

191
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:54,450
No, he's a hardworking kid.

192
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:55,450
You know, he's got a bright future ahead of him.

193
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:56,450
Please, please, please.

194
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:58,450
He needs this job to make a living, okay?

195
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:01,450
Please, just don't take his whole life away for one stupid little mistake.

196
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:02,450
Yes, Mr. Leo.

197
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:03,450
I beg you.

198
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:06,450
Please, forgive Joseph this one time.

199
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:09,450
He was just trying to teach some poor people a lesson.

200
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:12,450
He's never really made any mistakes before.

201
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:13,799
A lesson.

202
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:17,799
So for you people, making fun of the poor is just trivial.

203
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:19,059
Yes.

204
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:21,059
And what's wrong with that?

205
00:09:21,059 --> 00:09:24,059
Those filthy beggars are just like rats.

206
00:09:24,059 --> 00:09:28,120
Millions are born and die every day.

207
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,120
The desert was simply speeding up the masses.

208
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,120
Is that what you think?

209
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,759
What you're saying is completely outrageous.

210
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:39,789
David is right.

211
00:09:39,789 --> 00:09:41,789
You people make me sick!

212
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:43,789
Jack, get rid of these scumbacks!

213
00:09:43,789 --> 00:09:44,789
Get him!

214
00:09:44,789 --> 00:09:45,789
No, no, no, no, no!

215
00:09:45,789 --> 00:09:46,789
No, no, no, no, no, no!

216
00:09:46,789 --> 00:09:47,789
He's my son.

217
00:09:47,789 --> 00:09:48,789
He's my son.

218
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:49,789
I can't let you take him.

219
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:50,789
Come on.

220
00:09:50,789 --> 00:09:53,789
Mr. Leo can't we discuss this further?

221
00:09:53,789 --> 00:09:54,789
Any terms?

222
00:09:54,789 --> 00:09:55,789
Really.

223
00:09:55,789 --> 00:09:58,860
So you're trying to negotiate with...

224
00:09:58,860 --> 00:09:59,860
Fine.

225
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:00,860
You're gonna make me do this.

226
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:01,860
Call Drew.

227
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:02,860
Laura, call Drew.

228
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:03,860
You know Drew?

229
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:04,860
You know Drew?

230
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,860
He's the senior commander of the Brandore Security Force.

231
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:10,860
Yeah, so, Mr. Leo, since you're so incredibly heartless,

232
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,860
you can take my family off of the Thorne group.

233
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:14,860
Alright?

234
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,860
And wait for Drew to find you.

235
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:17,860
Because he will.

236
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:18,860
Wait for Drew.

237
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:37,259
Mr. Brandore.

238
00:10:37,259 --> 00:10:43,019
Leo has been missing for three years, but now he's returned home.

239
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:45,019
And he's a real man.

240
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:49,019
And now, I can finally make the announcement proudly to the medium.

241
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:51,019
That Leo is my son.

242
00:10:51,019 --> 00:10:52,019
Air.

243
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:54,220
To the Brandore family.

244
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:58,019
God bless Brandore!

245
00:10:58,019 --> 00:10:59,019
Move on.

246
00:10:59,019 --> 00:11:03,080
It's time to welcome the pride of Brandore.

247
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:07,679
Excuse me, Mr. Brandore, I gotta take this call.

248
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:14,779
What food I hell would dare disrespect you and Joseph.

249
00:11:14,779 --> 00:11:19,159
I'm gonna teach him a lesson that he ain't never gonna forget.

250
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:22,159
Conveniently, there's a mercenary from one of my teens.

251
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:24,929
You just hang tight.

252
00:11:24,929 --> 00:11:27,500
He's on his way.

253
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:33,500
Brandore Security Contractors, the largest mercenary company in the entire world.

254
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,860
They're made of legendary.

255
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,860
Brandore mercenaries?

256
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:41,860
It's been said they are stronger than the Army.

257
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:44,889
They even have fighter jets and warships.

258
00:11:44,889 --> 00:11:46,889
That's right.

259
00:11:46,889 --> 00:11:53,889
My brother Drew is not some small man that the phone group can mess with.

260
00:11:53,889 --> 00:11:55,889
He's a giant.

261
00:11:55,889 --> 00:11:59,809
It's been something to help this yet.

262
00:11:59,809 --> 00:12:02,809
The Thor and Air has nothing on these mercenaries assault rifles.

263
00:12:02,809 --> 00:12:08,940
Make your stupid sister apologize to Mr. Joseph.

264
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:09,940
The Brandore group.

265
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:10,940
We didn't know what that means.

266
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,940
They could kill all of us.

267
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,940
Nina, just be quiet for a moment.

268
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:15,940
Why?

269
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,940
I am tired of having this fool drag me down.

270
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:20,940
Hey you, you and your man better go with Mr. Joseph.

271
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,940
And not drag us into it.

272
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:26,639
Yeah, Nina, it's right.

273
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,889
The Brandore group is mysterious and powerful.

274
00:12:30,889 --> 00:12:31,889
Then we use mercenaries.

275
00:12:31,889 --> 00:12:35,500
Nina, there's no need to worry.

276
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,850
Because they are the ones that should be afraid.

277
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:41,850
Is this fake tough guy still pretending to be the Thor and Air?

278
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:43,850
No, what am I going to do? I'm so scared.

279
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:45,850
Fuck you. Listen to me.

280
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:48,850
I'm going to take good people right now and there's nothing you can do about it.

281
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:53,320
And thank me later. I'll take good care of her.

282
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,320
Nothing.

283
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,320
Jack.

284
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,320
Teach him a lesson, help him learn this.

285
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:01,590
You're so fucking scared.

286
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:02,590
Mr. Dyson.

287
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:04,590
Don't say I didn't warn you.

288
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:06,779
Drew is on his way right now.

289
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:08,779
If you touch me, you'll be the first to die.

290
00:13:08,779 --> 00:13:15,580
Jack Dyson, you got mad?

291
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,580
I'm going to tell Drew about this.

292
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,580
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

293
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,580
He's going to teach you a lesson.

294
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,580
Drew Aiken?

295
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:24,779
He's just a watchdog.

296
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:31,799
Did you just call my boss a watchdog?

297
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:33,799
You crazy son of a bitch.

298
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:40,179
It's Henry.

299
00:13:40,179 --> 00:13:42,590
From Drew's team.

300
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:46,620
I happen to be in the area on a mission.

301
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,620
And Captain sent me to help you deal with some trouble.

302
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,620
Well, that's them.

303
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,620
They're the ones that cause so much trouble.

304
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:57,179
Disrespected our leader.

305
00:13:57,179 --> 00:13:59,179
No, no, don't shoot.

306
00:13:59,179 --> 00:14:01,340
No, please don't shoot.

307
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,840
To beat up, Theo is the heir to the Thorne group.

308
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,840
And you can't hurt him.

309
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,840
And it's...

310
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,940
The regular mercenary doesn't give a shit about the Thorne group.

311
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,940
Say one more word.

312
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:14,940
And I'll send you to Africa to dig mine.

313
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,940
I don't know what to be, and I don't.

314
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,940
Here, I don't want to put you in harm's way.

315
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,940
Hey, I can't just sit here and watch you sit in danger.

316
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,940
It's okay, sweetheart.

317
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:23,940
It's okay.

318
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,700
And you...

319
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:29,700
No matter how strong or tough your team is,

320
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,700
you have to respect your elders.

321
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,700
Idiots!

322
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,700
Do you know who our boss is?

323
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,700
The Brindor group?

324
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:40,250
What connection could you possibly have with the Brindor group?

325
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:43,279
Shut up or I'll execute you right now.

326
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,279
Alright, let me explain.

327
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:48,279
Do you have any idea who Mr. Leo's father is?

328
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:54,740
He's a beggar, and his father's the beggar too.

329
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:56,740
Don't waste my time.

330
00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:07,220
What are you looking at?

331
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,220
Do you want to die?

332
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:12,019
You pimp, or doomed you idiots.

333
00:15:12,019 --> 00:15:16,019
Do you have any idea how powerful Mr. Leo's connections are,

334
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:18,019
or how important his background is?

335
00:15:18,019 --> 00:15:20,019
Is the heir to the Thorne group important?

336
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:23,269
To me, you're just a piece of trash.

337
00:15:23,269 --> 00:15:26,269
Joseph, how you want me to deal with these fools?

338
00:15:26,269 --> 00:15:27,269
It's up to you.

339
00:15:27,269 --> 00:15:29,269
I say, I take his girl right in front of him.

340
00:15:29,269 --> 00:15:32,879
So that's the last thing he sees before I kill him.

341
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:33,879
It sounds fun.

342
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:34,879
You can't do that.

343
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:39,759
Oh dare you don't, sure.

344
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,690
Yeah, where do you die?

345
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:42,690
Go for it.

346
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:45,460
We'll shut him up for good.

347
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,460
You were so cold in here earlier.

348
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,460
How are you going to make it up to her?

349
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,460
No, stop! Don't touch me!

350
00:15:49,460 --> 00:16:00,450
Your hands off her.

351
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:02,450
You're going to be a dead man!

352
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:03,450
What are you going to do?

353
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:04,450
Come on, Divina.

354
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:06,450
Let this cripple watch me take you.

355
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:38,779
Do you know who this woman is?

356
00:16:38,779 --> 00:16:40,779
She is calling your boss.

357
00:16:40,779 --> 00:16:44,490
I'm asking those wife's.

358
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:46,490
Make way for Mrs. Cynthia.

359
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:47,490
Make way!

360
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:49,059
Second Commander.

361
00:16:49,059 --> 00:16:50,059
My apologies.

362
00:16:50,059 --> 00:17:01,559
Miracle.

363
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:04,559
What a wonderful show of God's grace.

364
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:05,880
Leo.

365
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,029
Your legs.

366
00:17:08,029 --> 00:17:09,349
Bullshit.

367
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:11,349
Still putting on a brave face?

368
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:12,349
Who can you protect?

369
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:16,970
Damn it.

370
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:24,190
Oh my fucking kill you.

371
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:42,740
Don't you dare hurt him.

372
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:52,829
I can't believe it my child.

373
00:17:52,829 --> 00:17:54,829
You're in front of me.

374
00:17:54,829 --> 00:17:55,829
Cynthia Thorne.

375
00:17:55,829 --> 00:17:57,829
The chairman of the Thorne group.

376
00:17:57,829 --> 00:17:58,829
She's here in person.

377
00:17:58,829 --> 00:18:00,829
So sorry for making you worry, Mom.

378
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:05,099
That's Leo's mom.

379
00:18:05,099 --> 00:18:07,099
Hey there, pretty.

380
00:18:07,099 --> 00:18:08,099
Looking good.

381
00:18:08,099 --> 00:18:10,099
So you're this beggar's mother.

382
00:18:10,099 --> 00:18:11,099
Looking real good.

383
00:18:11,099 --> 00:18:12,460
Just my type.

384
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,460
A little older.

385
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:17,839
I bet you are quite the treat in bed.

386
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:23,299
How dare you insult a man like that?

387
00:18:23,299 --> 00:18:24,299
How dare you?

388
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:26,299
You know, that's the last mistake you're going to make,

389
00:18:26,299 --> 00:18:27,299
Henry.

390
00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:28,299
The last one!

391
00:18:28,299 --> 00:18:29,299
Who the fuck are you?

392
00:18:29,299 --> 00:18:30,299
How dare you pull a gun on me?

393
00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:32,299
You're about to be a dead man.

394
00:18:32,299 --> 00:18:33,660
You're a fool.

395
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:34,660
You're a fool.

396
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,880
You've been away from the team.

397
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,880
Too long.

398
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,880
Too long, Henry.

399
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,880
I'm second commander.

400
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,880
Second?

401
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,200
Second commander?

402
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,200
He's second commander?

403
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,200
No.

404
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,200
That's impossible.

405
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,200
How could you be second commander?

406
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,089
Sully, are you Divina?

407
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:55,049
Yes ma'am, I am.

408
00:18:55,049 --> 00:18:57,049
It's wonderful to meet you.

409
00:18:57,049 --> 00:18:59,900
You're a lovely girl.

410
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,900
So kind and generous.

411
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:04,130
Leo will be blessed to have you as his wife.

412
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:05,130
First commander?

413
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:07,220
Henry, what's the matter?

414
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,220
Mr. Brando, we're speaking with the governor now.

415
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:11,220
I'm going to order to come first.

416
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,220
We'll be there soon.

417
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:14,220
Commander, we have a situation.

418
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,220
I ran into a second commander.

419
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:18,220
He's still against us.

420
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:20,220
He's siding with those who believe Joseph.

421
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,220
Nonsense.

422
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,220
What's that, Commander?

423
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,220
His name is Connor.

424
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,220
Bullshit.

425
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:28,450
Connor was assigned to protect his nonless top ranking figure

426
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:29,450
years ago.

427
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:30,450
How could he be there?

428
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:32,450
He's an imposter human, he is.

429
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:34,450
An imposter?

430
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:44,339
Stop, Henry.

431
00:19:44,339 --> 00:19:45,339
Stop.

432
00:19:45,339 --> 00:19:47,339
You want to be expelled from the team?

433
00:19:47,339 --> 00:19:48,339
Huh?

434
00:19:48,339 --> 00:19:49,339
You piece of shit.

435
00:19:49,339 --> 00:19:51,339
You're not a second commander.

436
00:19:51,339 --> 00:19:52,339
You're an imposter.

437
00:19:52,339 --> 00:19:55,180
I should go right now.

438
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,180
You teach your lesson.

439
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:58,180
Get your hands off her.

440
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,819
Let her go.

441
00:19:59,819 --> 00:20:03,599
No.

442
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:04,599
Let go of her.

443
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:05,599
No.

444
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:10,029
You're going to pay for what you did.

445
00:20:10,029 --> 00:20:13,029
Divina is about to become my wife.

446
00:20:13,029 --> 00:20:16,029
And not only will she be the wife of the President of the Thorne

447
00:20:16,029 --> 00:20:21,289
Group, she's also attached to her even more powerful, dangerous family.

448
00:20:21,289 --> 00:20:23,700
I'll let her go.

449
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,700
I will make sure you suffer for the rest of your fucking life.

450
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,700
Keep talking crap.

451
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,700
You piece of shit.

452
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:33,390
The President of the Thorne.

453
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:34,390
What do you want?

454
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:36,390
Release Mrs. Divina now.

455
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:39,390
Well, I'm going to blow her brains out of shooter in the head.

456
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:44,660
You think I'm scared of you?

457
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,660
She's true sister.

458
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:52,940
If you don't care about her life, then let's vote you.

459
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:53,940
No.

460
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:54,940
You're not joking.

461
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:55,940
Two.

462
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:56,940
Three.

463
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:09,740
ze.

464
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:10,740
One.

465
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,740
Look who us Mrs. Laura, she's committed to you sister.

466
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:13,740
You can kill her.

467
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,740
Jill makes an old man with her lives.

468
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:33,140
Are you all right, Divina?

469
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,140
Yes, ma'am.

470
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,230
I'm okay.

471
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:38,230
Drew is an utter fool.

472
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,259
He can't even control his own man.

473
00:21:40,259 --> 00:21:43,259
If I were to tell him to die, you wouldn't utter a single word.

474
00:21:43,259 --> 00:21:46,539
Ball.

475
00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:56,539
You're finally here.

476
00:21:56,539 --> 00:21:58,539
They wanted to shoot me, Drew.

477
00:21:58,539 --> 00:21:59,539
Let me see who's talking his bolt.

478
00:21:59,539 --> 00:22:01,460
Talking is bullshit.

479
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,559
Oh, it's a woman.

480
00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:05,160
Foolish woman.

481
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:08,430
Divina, we're in real trouble here.

482
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:09,990
Those mercenaries have really shown up

483
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:11,910
and they have the Brandore groups backing.

484
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:13,470
What do we do?

485
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:14,910
Isn't it obvious, Divina?

486
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:17,130
All this trouble is caused by your damn boyfriend.

487
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:21,400
Just apologize to Mr. Drew.

488
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,240
This is all my fault.

489
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,599
I don't wanna drag you all into this.

490
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:27,630
This is just on me, but, I mean, Leo and his bonds

491
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:29,910
to F for us, they've been an ally to us.

492
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:32,140
We can't just append in them.

493
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:33,460
Idious!

494
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:36,410
Kneel down, they've been for mercy.

495
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:39,289
Commander Drew is the leader

496
00:22:39,289 --> 00:22:41,329
of the Brandore mercenary company.

497
00:22:41,329 --> 00:22:43,690
Mr. Brandore's right-hand man.

498
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:47,359
The Thorne group is nothing in front of him.

499
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:49,019
Leo, what do we do?

500
00:22:49,019 --> 00:22:50,380
The Brandore group is too powerful.

501
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:52,180
We can't append them.

502
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:54,380
I can do this.

503
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:57,480
Who are the bastards who've done this to you?

504
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,279
Connor, is that you?

505
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:00,279
What the hell are you doing?

506
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:01,880
You're trying to betray us all.

507
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,279
Commander Drew, I'm on a mission.

508
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:12,980
I mission my ass, holster that weapon.

509
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:15,089
The line before I slap you, right?

510
00:23:15,089 --> 00:23:17,059
We're gonna do that or no?

511
00:23:17,059 --> 00:23:21,460
Take it from the slap.

512
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:26,579
So, you're the commander of the Brandore mercenary group,

513
00:23:26,579 --> 00:23:28,099
and you don't even know which people

514
00:23:28,099 --> 00:23:30,500
you're supposed to be protected.

515
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:37,980
It's a shame all the Brandore money is going to waste.

516
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:40,819
Shit, how dare you disrespect the Brandore payment?

517
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:42,059
You're gonna pay.

518
00:23:42,059 --> 00:23:48,980
Yeah, you are the one who is going to pay.

519
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:50,579
I'm court and death.

520
00:23:50,579 --> 00:23:52,500
I've heard about your brave legacy,

521
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:56,380
but today you are acting very foolish.

522
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:58,619
You don't need to say another word.

523
00:23:58,619 --> 00:24:00,099
Is that the truth today?

524
00:24:00,099 --> 00:24:01,940
Your title is removed,

525
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,059
and you are gonna suffer retribution

526
00:24:04,059 --> 00:24:06,940
for everything you have done today.

527
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:09,259
You're funny, honey.

528
00:24:09,259 --> 00:24:10,730
And a bit dumb,

529
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:13,930
but you do got a nice little body there.

530
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:15,609
Since you heard about my legacy,

531
00:24:15,609 --> 00:24:17,450
why don't you come up being my baby doll

532
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:19,289
and let me show your person, hey.

533
00:24:19,289 --> 00:24:21,089
Don't touch her.

534
00:24:21,089 --> 00:24:23,970
Keep your filthy hands off of me.

535
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:25,710
Oh!

536
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:27,410
What do you think you're doing?

537
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:30,289
Stopping a woman is a side of weakness.

538
00:24:30,289 --> 00:24:32,970
Don't you think I won't slap me a woman?

539
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:36,410
You'd be honored to sleep with me, you dirty bitch.

540
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:38,369
You pathetic piece of shit.

541
00:24:38,369 --> 00:24:41,569
Any woman that sleeps with you must be miserable.

542
00:24:41,569 --> 00:24:43,250
You're gonna wish that you were never born,

543
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:45,970
even now God can't save you.

544
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:48,289
I'm sick of that little mouth of yours, boy.

545
00:24:48,289 --> 00:24:50,329
How about I fuck your mama right in front of you right now?

546
00:24:50,329 --> 00:24:57,190
Then when that mouth gonna say?

547
00:24:57,190 --> 00:25:00,339
Mr. Brandor, good to see you.

548
00:25:00,339 --> 00:25:02,980
The address you gave me isn't far at all.

549
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:06,130
We'll be able to see young Mr. Brandor soon.

550
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:08,289
How's the temperature in the car?

551
00:25:08,289 --> 00:25:10,329
It's fine, Colbert.

552
00:25:10,329 --> 00:25:11,569
But if you don't mind,

553
00:25:11,569 --> 00:25:13,529
please make it a little bit cooler.

554
00:25:13,529 --> 00:25:14,369
Certainly, sir.

555
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,559
Hello, my darling.

556
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:24,559
Did you miss me?

557
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,119
You flow old donkey.

558
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:27,839
Where the hell are you?

559
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:30,240
Someone here not only wants to kill your child,

560
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,160
but he's also sexually harassing your wife.

561
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:36,059
What?

562
00:25:36,059 --> 00:25:36,900
Goodbye.

563
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,579
Cynthia, my darling.

564
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:40,259
Who's saying such things?

565
00:25:40,259 --> 00:25:41,619
Tell me his name.

566
00:25:41,619 --> 00:25:43,339
What happened, Mr. Brandor?

567
00:25:43,339 --> 00:25:45,819
Someone just threatened my son

568
00:25:45,819 --> 00:25:48,539
and threatened my wife with rape.

569
00:25:48,539 --> 00:25:49,460
What?

570
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,299
Who?

571
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:52,900
Give me to the address in 10 minutes.

572
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:56,460
Governor, don't you think you owe me an explanation

573
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,940
as to how this is happening to my family?

574
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:01,069
Mr. Brandor.

575
00:26:01,069 --> 00:26:02,990
I'll summon the state troops.

576
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:05,710
That way you have the right to command them.

577
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:07,430
I assure you,

578
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:10,750
anyone who disrespects Brandor

579
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:16,900
will be buried under Memphis bullets.

580
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:19,180
Do you think you're calling the honey your savior?

581
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:21,259
I ain't nobody gonna save you.

582
00:26:21,259 --> 00:26:25,289
You're piling on the corpse.

583
00:26:25,289 --> 00:26:26,130
When they get here

584
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:29,250
and realize they crossed the Brandor mercenary commander,

585
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:31,690
they'll piss their pants and run like rats.

586
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:33,730
You wait on my husband gets here.

587
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:36,130
Let's see who pisses their pants then.

588
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:37,450
Husband.

589
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:38,329
You hear that, Joseph?

590
00:26:38,329 --> 00:26:39,369
We got a wild one here.

591
00:26:39,369 --> 00:26:40,210
She won't.

592
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:41,049
It's recent.

593
00:26:41,049 --> 00:26:42,460
How dare you?

594
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:45,839
You sexist scuff.

595
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:47,559
See that field over there?

596
00:26:47,559 --> 00:26:49,200
When my father gets here,

597
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:56,650
that'll be your grave and else.

598
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:59,210
How dare you disrespect Commander Drew?

599
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:01,809
What you're just is delinquent is your father.

600
00:27:01,809 --> 00:27:02,849
And when he gets here,

601
00:27:02,849 --> 00:27:04,569
you'll die right next to him.

602
00:27:04,569 --> 00:27:08,089
You should enjoy your last happy moment.

603
00:27:08,089 --> 00:27:10,690
As soon as you won't even be able to cry.

604
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:12,049
Well, I've had enough.

605
00:27:12,049 --> 00:27:13,210
Get down on your knees

606
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:15,329
and beg me for forgiveness.

607
00:27:15,329 --> 00:27:16,930
Stop danger me.

608
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:20,279
That'll never happen.

609
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:21,119
In my daydream.

610
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:22,200
Is that what you say?

611
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,799
Joseph, I need you.

612
00:27:23,799 --> 00:27:25,279
Rita, wake up.

613
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:27,119
He can't protect you.

614
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:28,440
Don't you get it?

615
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,720
Once I'm done with you,

616
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:32,759
I'm gonna sell you off to the broth.

617
00:27:32,759 --> 00:27:34,839
That way you're broken just like him.

618
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:37,420
If you care so much about him,

619
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:39,019
let's let him watch.

620
00:27:39,019 --> 00:27:41,140
I'm gonna belittle him right in front of you.

621
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,799
How's that?

622
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:44,839
Little Leo, come here.

623
00:27:44,839 --> 00:27:45,680
Come here.

624
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:48,180
You fucking asshole.

625
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,470
Get down.

626
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:53,500
Beg me for your forgiveness.

627
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:57,799
Go ahead.

628
00:27:57,799 --> 00:28:00,740
Faster.

629
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:02,500
You're gonna fall into a trap.

630
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:06,299
Don't worry, Anita.

631
00:28:06,299 --> 00:28:08,150
Then you, Joseph.

632
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:13,299
I'm sorry to say that today's your death day.

633
00:28:13,299 --> 00:28:15,700
We'll see you if it's buried first.

634
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,500
Drew, why don't you go ahead

635
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,500
and play close quarters with Mom here.

636
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,019
We'll see if he's still smiling.

637
00:28:21,019 --> 00:28:24,779
That's the best idea you had all day, Drew.

638
00:28:24,779 --> 00:28:25,619
Why not?

639
00:28:25,619 --> 00:28:26,460
Faster.

640
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,299
Don't touch me.

641
00:28:28,299 --> 00:28:29,299
Me!

642
00:28:29,299 --> 00:28:35,299
Five.

643
00:28:35,299 --> 00:28:36,619
Asshole.

644
00:28:36,619 --> 00:28:42,900
You can't say that to Miss Cynthia.

645
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:45,619
You don't have the capacity to care for anyone else.

646
00:28:45,619 --> 00:28:47,180
So I thought Drew takes care of Mom.

647
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,500
He's taking care of you.

648
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,380
I'll make him wish he was dead.

649
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:52,140
Yeah, look, he's going to scum.

650
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:54,299
You burning hell for this.

651
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:56,779
Police Miss Cynthia need to be done right now.

652
00:28:56,779 --> 00:28:58,500
Daniel, are you crazy?

653
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,089
Daniel.

654
00:29:00,089 --> 00:29:00,930
Put it down.

655
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:03,900
You're gonna make us kill you.

656
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,500
Cows ain't supposed to play with you.

657
00:29:05,539 --> 00:29:06,539
Come here.

658
00:29:06,539 --> 00:29:08,500
Move off.

659
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,140
You even know how to use this thing.

660
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:10,980
Let me show you.

661
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:12,140
No, don't shoot me.
