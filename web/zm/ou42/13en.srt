1
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:10,029
Mr. Brando, is that the Lord Brando?

2
00:00:10,029 --> 00:00:11,029
Focus.

3
00:00:11,029 --> 00:00:13,429
Everyone speak and act normally.

4
00:00:13,429 --> 00:00:15,230
We don't want to offend Mr. Brando.

5
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:19,230
The Brando or group is the most powerful organization in the world.

6
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,230
And if we offend him, not even Drew can save us.

7
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,230
Mr. Brando!

8
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:28,789
Mr. Brando, what are you doing here?

9
00:00:28,789 --> 00:00:33,880
It's got the mistake of the answer. You shouldn't be here. You dirty your shoes.

10
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:37,880
Drew, weren't you attending two personal matters? What are you doing here?

11
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,880
Mr. Brando cares about me. It seems he values me.

12
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,880
It's likely I'll get a promotion sometime soon.

13
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:49,880
You shit-ass people, sir. They bully my sister and disrespect me and the Brandoar name.

14
00:00:49,880 --> 00:01:00,399
That's a lie. You are the one who believe Leo and I'm disrespecting the Cynthia.

15
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,689
Show me these shit-ass people you just mentioned.

16
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:10,939
Damn it. Him. Show some respect, don't you know who this man is? This Mr. Brandoar.

17
00:01:10,939 --> 00:01:13,939
Exactly. No manners at all.

18
00:01:13,939 --> 00:01:17,939
Kneel down and beg for forgiveness from Mr. Brandoar.

19
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:21,939
See, Drew is vital to the Brandoar group.

20
00:01:21,939 --> 00:01:25,170
Mr. Brando is here because of him.

21
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:31,260
Today you're going to learn that if you cross us, it's the biggest mistake you'll ever make.

22
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:35,829
So get on your knees and apologize.

23
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:38,829
You're going to fucking regret it now.

24
00:01:38,829 --> 00:01:43,829
You idiot. You're all the fools that should be kneeling down in front of me and apologizing.
