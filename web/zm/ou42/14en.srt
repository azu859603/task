1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,600
How dare you act this way in front of Mr. Brandor.

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,000
You fool.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,700
You still think your useless ass father could come save you?

4
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:08,500
This is Mr. Brandor.

5
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,900
Anybody come around here going to get killed.

6
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,800
It's really a shame, Drew.

7
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,300
Because in fact,

8
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,500
Mr. Brandor is here for me.

9
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:21,129
But you were right about the last day you said, yeah.

10
00:00:21,129 --> 00:00:24,629
Because you might as well take your own gun and put it to your head.

11
00:00:24,629 --> 00:00:27,030
You're going to be the one that dies today.

12
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,030
You scum.

13
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:32,030
This is Mr. Brandor headed a Brandor group.

14
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:34,729
Your poor ass couldn't touch this man's shoes.

15
00:00:34,729 --> 00:00:36,729
How dare you insult me?

16
00:00:36,729 --> 00:00:40,130
Understand that Drew is vital to the Brandor group.

17
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:42,630
Mr. Brandor is here to see Commander Drew.

18
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:46,329
And today you're going to realize why crossing us is a big mistake.

19
00:00:46,329 --> 00:00:48,729
Get down and apologize.

20
00:00:48,729 --> 00:00:51,130
Sir, that's not really a means. It's a mistake.

21
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:53,090
Mr. Brandor, sir.

22
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:55,490
You shouldn't be here, sir. This place is too dirty.

23
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:57,689
You shouldn't be with this girl.

24
00:00:57,789 --> 00:00:59,390
Let me take care of this fool right now.

25
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:01,590
Then we can go get the young Mr. Brandor.

26
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,189
What's your plan?

27
00:01:03,189 --> 00:01:04,090
My plan.

28
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:06,689
I'm going to put bullet through this man's head right now.

29
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:12,200
No! No! Stop! Please!

30
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,560
You know the wrong thing.

31
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,760
That's a professional mercenary.

32
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:22,849
You should always ask for the name of the target before pulling the trigger.

33
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:28,319
I know, isn't it? That's Leo Thorton.

34
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:30,579
You're wrong.

35
00:01:30,579 --> 00:01:32,579
It's Leo Brandor.

36
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:34,280
You fucking idiot!
