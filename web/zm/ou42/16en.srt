1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:03,620
Leo, I'm such an asshole. I didn't know it was you.

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:09,619
I'm sorry, Mr. Thorpe. I mean, Mr. Brandor, I was wrong. Please don't banish me like you did, Henry.

3
00:00:09,619 --> 00:00:15,619
Mr. Leo, sir, sir, I was wrong. We were so very wrong. Just please, please, please have mercy on us.

4
00:00:15,619 --> 00:00:21,620
Will this give you all the money you want, sir? Just please, sir, spare us.

5
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:25,620
You think I need your money? Well, let me tell you something.

6
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:29,620
As of right now, I am confiscating all of your bank accounts.

7
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:34,619
No. No. That's our money. You can't freeze it.

8
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:37,619
No. You can't do the choice. No.

9
00:00:37,619 --> 00:00:43,619
Now you can both live like the beggars that you both disdain so much. Take them out of here.

10
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:48,009
No. No. No. No. No.

11
00:00:48,009 --> 00:00:49,009
I live without our money.

12
00:00:49,009 --> 00:00:53,009
And you, you are banished from the Brandor group.

13
00:00:53,009 --> 00:00:56,640
and I'm confiscating your bank accounts as well.

14
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,280
No, Mr. Brandore, please, I'm begging you.

15
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,560
Please forgive me for my foolish ignorance.

16
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,879
I can't be banished.

17
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,879
I've got a lot of enemies and those assets took me 10 years to build.

18
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:12,000
Let me tell you something. I don't care if you live or die.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,239
I didn't know you was Mr. Brandore Jr.

20
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:15,760
Please forgive me sir.

21
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,280
Please, I was a mistake. I apologize.

22
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,519
You shouldn't be apologizing to me.

23
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:26,719
You should be apologizing to all of the women that you've manipulated over your entire life.

24
00:01:27,579 --> 00:01:33,099
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I said all them nasty things to those honorable women.

25
00:01:33,099 --> 00:01:37,340
Please forgive me sir. Mr. Brandore, please.

26
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:41,019
I'm begging you. It was a mistake. It was just a big mistake.

27
00:01:41,019 --> 00:01:44,540
You can't banish me. I won't last. They'll kill me.

28
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:57,120
That's just not possible. No, please sir. No. Don't move.

29
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,819
Please sir. What are you doing with me?

30
00:02:01,819 --> 00:02:05,099
You ruined me. Because of you, I got banned.

31
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:13,860
Finish cousin. Mr. Brandore thinks I'll betray. I'm gonna kill you.

32
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:21,060
If you had come any later, you wouldn't have a wife in the trial list.

33
00:02:21,969 --> 00:02:29,789
Forgive me darling, for being late. Leo, it's been so long.

34
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:33,490
You've grown into an outstanding young man.

35
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:42,099
Mr. Dad. All right. What are you planning on doing with these?

36
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:51,439
People. These people are going to wish that they've never ever been born into this world.

37
00:02:51,439 --> 00:03:01,099
Jack Connor, take them away. Yes sir. I'm going to kill you. Mr. Brandore, please.

38
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:14,430
Please. And you. God. Please. We know we were wrong. Mr. Brandore, we really didn't know who you are.

39
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:20,370
That's why we offended you. If we had known, we never would have dared.

40
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:26,110
Who I am is not important. And as for Divina, she is not just

41
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:30,030
surprised that can be traded. How dare you force her upon Joseph?

42
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:40,129
It's not only kidnapping, it's rape. Leo. You worthless idiot. You really like

43
00:03:40,129 --> 00:03:46,129
dangling your wealth over other people's heads? Well, as of today, I'm taking all of your wealth

44
00:03:46,129 --> 00:03:51,330
from you. I am bankrupting your company and making sure that all of your future projects go

45
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,539
as long as I'm alive, I'll make sure all goes

46
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:12,270
take this quarter. Now it's the only thing that you have left to your name. Enjoy the slums.

47
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:24,180
My money. Mr. Leo, please. Just serious. We cannot live without money.

48
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:32,100
Get him out of here. No. He would have thought that Leo had such an old background.

49
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:40,990
Nina, I think you should leave. What do you mean? Are you trying to?

50
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:45,339
Your behavior has been ridiculous today. I don't think this engagement is going to work.

51
00:04:46,379 --> 00:04:55,060
Are you asshole? What are you trying to say? I'm done. And I'm sorry.

52
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:59,199
Really? You think I have to marry you? You'll regret this.

53
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:08,300
Nina. From now on, we have no more obstacles in our way. And like I said,

54
00:05:09,339 --> 00:05:15,420
I will always protect you. Leo, I trust you. You are a hero.

55
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:29,540
Mom. Dad. Devina's the one who took care of me those long three years while I was in a coma.

56
00:05:31,939 --> 00:05:40,350
She worked tirelessly every day to pay for my treatment. She's my guardian angel.

57
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:49,500
I want her to be my life. Leo, you're not being very genuinely. You haven't even asked

58
00:05:49,500 --> 00:06:03,009
dear Devina if she's willing. Right. I'm sorry. I got too excited. Re-mariny.

59
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:22,290
I will. Leo is back and I will host a grand well-comptie for now. And we will announce that Leo

60
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:29,220
and Devina are getting married. That's a brilliant idea my dear. Dear friends,

61
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,240
please invite all of your family and friends to make a major announcement

62
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:45,810
that Devina will be a member of the Brandoar family. Mr. Brandoar, we might not do it this way

63
00:06:46,660 --> 00:07:02,750
because we don't have a lot of money. We don't have a big family or a lot of friends. Dear friends,

64
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:08,269
they distance themselves from you because they're true foliage. Well, because of anything you do.

65
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:16,449
Yes, they're going to miss a huge opportunity for sure. Thank you, Mr. Brandoar. This door?

66
00:07:18,029 --> 00:07:23,389
Well, in that case, I'll call everyone I know and invite them to Leo's welcoming,

67
00:07:23,389 --> 00:07:29,600
worry. I want Leo and Devina to have everyone's blessing. Well, that's a great idea, Barton.

68
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:38,639
Let's do it. Devina, why don't you invite your friends to the, to the party? Friends,

69
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:48,100
they all are situation is worse than you think. No one will associate with us

70
00:07:49,040 --> 00:08:01,579
outside of my uncle's family. Hi, Bob. This is Barton. I wanted to, but how did it go?

71
00:08:02,779 --> 00:08:20,399
He hung up. You see? Mr. Bailey, what do you think in Leo? I was thinking that

72
00:08:22,029 --> 00:08:27,939
maybe I should send out the invitations for the party with the Brandoar name on it. Maybe it'll

73
00:08:27,939 --> 00:08:31,699
be more community that way. Of course, everyone's going to answer an invitation

74
00:08:31,699 --> 00:08:37,919
for the Brandoar, Alan. Yes, and that way we don't have to make any calls. All right, Leo,

75
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:42,509
I know you don't want to leave Devina, but you need to return your family first.

76
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:47,379
Your uncles are extremely worried about you. They spend a lot of money trying to find you.

77
00:08:48,220 --> 00:09:16,500
Of course, Dad. I'll see you at the party. I'll see you at the party. Send an invitation to

78
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:26,419
Devina's uncle's family, but do not mention my relationship with her. Sir, do as I say, my reasons.

79
00:09:26,419 --> 00:09:57,059
As you say, sir, I'll handle it. Lovely place. Oh, Barton, this is my first time in a place like this.

80
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:02,019
Do you think Bob and the others will come? Well, they would have to, right?

81
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:09,220
It's an invitation from the Brandoar. There's really no reason for them not to. Guys, it's okay.

82
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:14,659
Leo knows our situation, and besides, even if no one comes, it's not going to affect our loved

83
00:10:14,659 --> 00:10:30,350
masses. Our look is finally changed. Brandoar's invited us to young Brandoar's welcoming party.

84
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:35,899
This is a chance to meet some big names. My boyfriend, Billy's father, is a hotel manager here.

85
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:41,820
Maybe he can accuse us around. Absolutely. Maybe. We can even meet the family,

86
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:46,940
members of the Brandoar family. You know it. My dear, I knew you meet the perfect boyfriend.

87
00:10:47,019 --> 00:10:53,759
You're a thousand times better than that, silly Divina, and her terrible Bailey family.

88
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:56,960
You know what? She can bring herself to leave that losing boyfriend of hers.

89
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:08,990
She's not even qualified enough to be compared to me. You made it. Barton, what the hell are you

90
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:12,590
doing here? Why did you even get an invitation to the Brandoar party in the first place?

91
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,899
Even though it's been a while, I knew you would still come.

92
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:26,350
Yes, Uncle Bob, I really appreciate that you're still willing to reach out to us.

93
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:32,990
No, no, no. This has the reasons we are here, have nothing to do with you at all. Bob, I tried

94
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:38,269
to call you yesterday. Young Mr. Brandoar will be announcing his engagement to Divina. I tried

95
00:11:38,269 --> 00:11:42,830
to tell you, but you hung up, or would you just shut up? Do you even know what you're saying?

96
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:48,029
This is unbelievable. You're disgusting poor people. How serious do you think of such delusions?

97
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:56,179
Leo, did you tell Jack not to mention your relationship with Divina in the reception

98
00:11:56,179 --> 00:12:04,879
invitation? That's correct. We will spoil Divina's family and friends with a typical

99
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:09,919
Brandoar family hospitality. But until then, I want to conduct a little test.

100
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:19,059
To see where Divina's family and friends loyalty lies. Oh, I see. I'll be heading down to the party.

101
00:12:19,059 --> 00:12:28,059
Governor Colbert's and father should be finishing their congress safe. I suggest you meet me down

102
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:37,570
guys, we're serious. Divina is going to marry Mr. Leo Brandoar. Didn't you see it on the

103
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:44,480
invitation? This is Mr. Leo Brandoar's welcoming party. It is not a wedding announcement. So I

104
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,879
don't know what the hell you're talking about. Daniel, you and Martin need to shut up and stop

105
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:56,429
spreading rumors. Did you hear that? These idiots actually think Mr. Leo Brandoar would marry this poor

106
00:12:56,509 --> 00:13:05,169
girl. I think they've been reading many fairy tales. The young Mr. Brandoar would be better off marrying

107
00:13:05,169 --> 00:13:16,129
me. But it's true, Divina, these wealthy and powerful people don't accept us. Maybe it was a

108
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:20,370
mistake showing up. I can't believe Leo didn't tell Bob's family about the wedding. You think

109
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:27,200
he's having second thoughts about the marriage? No. I don't know. We have to trust Leo. Mom,

110
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:31,519
we have said we were the guests of honor at the party just like himself. Idiots.

111
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:48,909
Mia, east the relatives of your uncle family? What a bunch of losers. Like you said,

112
00:13:49,549 --> 00:13:53,309
they've ruined your good mood. I don't like that. Do you want me to kick them out?

113
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:14,049
Security. Take out the trash. Wait, no, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, you threw us out. Idiot.

114
00:14:14,049 --> 00:14:18,690
Billy's father is the owner of the hotel. If he wants to teach you a lesson,

115
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:23,970
he just has to say the word. Right. Mia isn't as stupid as you are wasting all your time and money

116
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:29,250
when you're pathetic boyfriend. And now you break into this noble party, pretending that Mr. Brandoar

117
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:35,250
is going to marry you? That it can't be. Your stupidity is a ploy. You're the most ridiculous person

118
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:51,980
in the world. Bob, watch your mouth. Divina is not stupid. We never lied. Everything we said was

119
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:58,580
the truth. Oh, Barton. Being promised to remind your brain. I actually feel sorry for you.

120
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:05,009
Not really. It seems that we should have attended that ridiculous

121
00:15:05,009 --> 00:15:10,049
fundraiser that you threw. Maybe if we donated some money, you wouldn't be so dramatic. Don't

122
00:15:10,049 --> 00:15:14,370
you dare speak to my father like that. We are family. How can you be so cruel?

123
00:15:15,169 --> 00:15:20,129
Billy girls. Oh, and make cruel. There's some other slums on you all the way from here. You're

124
00:15:20,129 --> 00:15:25,980
polluting the air of this pardon. Make me sick. Get the hell out of here, you favorite.

125
00:15:27,019 --> 00:15:43,870
Just because you're wealthy does not mean you shouldn't insult others. Aubrey lies in your soul.
