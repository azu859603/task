They say every story has a beginning.

2
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.079
As a best-selling romance writer,

3
00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:22.079
I thought I knew everything about love,

4
00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:27.600
but I got it all wrong.

5
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.809
There you are, Edith.

6
00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:33.810
I'm borrowing a husband for dinner again tonight.

7
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.810
I hope you don't mind.

8
00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.030
Nolan is my husband, Nancy, not yours.

9
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.030
He was just forced to marry you.

10
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.030
If it's a choice between you or me,

11
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.030
he's always going to pick me.

12
00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.799
Do you smell gas?
