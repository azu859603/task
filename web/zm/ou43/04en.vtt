00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I want you to give me a child.

2
00:00:04.459 --> 00:00:05.820
I want to have your baby no one.

3
00:00:14.859 --> 00:00:15.660
No, no.

4
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.300
Contract life is bad enough, huh?

5
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.980
Now you want to strip me even more with a child?

6
00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.179
We've been married for three years.

7
00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:26.219
Can't you spare me a little love?

8
00:00:26.219 --> 00:00:28.140
No love, no sex, remember?

9
00:00:29.219 --> 00:00:31.300
Contract marriage is still a marriage.

10
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.259
I'm your wife no one.

11
00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:33.299
My gosh, you need us enough.

12
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.939
Something happened today.

13
00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:36.979
I was at a cafe.

14
00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:39.539
Edith, I've spent a whole day driving people out of a collapsed building.

15
00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:41.939
I know. Nancy was one of them.

16
00:00:41.939 --> 00:00:42.979
You and Nancy.

17
00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:44.820
Mike, I gave a shit.

18
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:45.700
You had the lunch.

19
00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:54.659
Of course you don't care about me or I are counter-married.

20
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.740
Hey Nolan, I didn't realize your wife was injured in the cafe explosion yesterday.

21
00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.540
What?

22
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.409
Yeah, she's listed as one of the casualties.

23
00:01:08.209 --> 00:01:08.689
Is she okay?

24
00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.349
Something happened today.

25
00:01:12.349 --> 00:01:13.230
I was at a cafe.
