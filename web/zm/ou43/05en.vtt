00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:16.019
Yeah, it's at the same hospital overnight.

2
00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:18.789
I know she'd appreciate it with her friend.

3
00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:20.429
We're not really friends.

4
00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:22.469
It's meant to be kind, okay?

5
00:00:22.469 --> 00:00:25.589
Like you would with my father.

6
00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:29.320
Do you like her?

7
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:44.759
Just do what I said, Edith.

8
00:00:44.759 --> 00:00:45.759
How are you?

9
00:00:45.759 --> 00:00:48.399
Nolan asked me to visit.

10
00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:49.399
Ah, Edith.

11
00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:56.170
I'm glad you're here, actually.

12
00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.649
I think it's better that you hear it from me

13
00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:02.380
than from Nolan.

14
00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.980
I'm pregnant.

15
00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.010
Good morning, Mrs. Blair.

16
00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.069
Good morning.

17
00:01:11.069 --> 00:01:14.980
We booked in all your scans and checkups.

18
00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:19.290
I hope your husband, Nolan, can be there.

19
00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.870
Lin isn't against having a child.

20
00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:26.709
He just doesn't want one with me.
