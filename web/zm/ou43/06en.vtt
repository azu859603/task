00:00:07.599 --> 00:00:11.599
Excuse me. I'm looking for a captain, no one blare.

2
00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:15.599
He's just ducked out to go buy something, but he shouldn't be too much longer if you, uh...

3
00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:26.579
If you want to wait around, uh, I'm Frankie.

4
00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:27.829
Ida.

5
00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:30.789
You're not no one's wife, are you?

6
00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:33.390
It's me.

7
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.390
Well, it's good to finally meet you.

8
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.390
I can understand why, uh, no one was keeping you to himself for so long.

9
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.390
Smart guy.

10
00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.420
Hey, um, how about I give you a tour of the buy house?

11
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.479
Show you around a little bit while you wait.

12
00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:51.310
Yeah, so this is the kitchen.

13
00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.380
And that brings us to the end of Frankie's tours.

14
00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.380
Make sure you leave me five stars on a trip advisor.

15
00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:03.049
Uh, Ida.

16
00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:05.590
What are you doing here?

17
00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.590
I saw you name the casualty list for yesterday.

18
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.620
We were at the cafe when it exploded.

19
00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.780
I wanted divorce.

20
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.480
What?
