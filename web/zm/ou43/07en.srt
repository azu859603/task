00:00:01,169 --> 00:00:03,359
Is this all kind of joke?

2
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:07,360
I've spoken to my lawyer. She said we need to sign these forms to get the process started.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,519
You can't at least have a reason?

4
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,519
I thought you'd be happy. It's what you want, isn't it?

5
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:13,519
No, I get it.

6
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,519
You suck enough money out of my family last time for you to move on, huh?

7
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:19,519
Believe what you want. I don't care what you think about me anymore, Nolan.

8
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:24,519
I've waited three years for you to see me properly, but that's never going to happen. I'm done.

9
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:28,519
What about my father, huh? He arranged his marriage. You know I'll hate this.

10
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:36,729
I love your father, but I can't live like this anymore. I've already signed them.

11
00:00:36,729 --> 00:00:53,990
What? Yeah. No, of course. I'll be right there.

12
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:54,990
What's wrong?

13
00:00:54,990 --> 00:01:01,869
Dad's at a heart attack. We need to go to the hospital right now.
