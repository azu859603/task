He said this was his room. They must be running more tests on him.

2
00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.609
They said he only had chest pain. No resuscitation required.

3
00:00:10.609 --> 00:00:12.609
That's good, right?

4
00:00:12.609 --> 00:00:18.629
I don't get it. Dad's always been so healthy, you know? All that golf he plays?

5
00:00:18.629 --> 00:00:21.859
Don't forget all that disgusting kale he eats.

6
00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:29.199
Dad? Dad?

7
00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:33.229
Hey, I'm fine. I made good hands here. Thank you.

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:37.030
Well, piggy, piggy. What happened?

9
00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:43.219
Well, I was on the yacht. It just hit me. It was like a rhino sitting on my chest.

10
00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:50.479
I couldn't even grab my phone. Then I thought I'd seen the two of you settle down, meeting my grandkids.

11
00:00:50.479 --> 00:01:04.170
I don't know what happened. I grabbed my phone and I dialed. You both saved my life.
