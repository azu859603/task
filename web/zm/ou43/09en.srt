1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,519
Your father will need bypass surgery.

2
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:11,279
I booked him for surgery in two weeks to allow him time to stabilize.

3
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:14,279
Um, yeah, what can we do?

4
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:16,559
Well, he needs to say calm until then.

5
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:25,339
Not too much excitement or agitation.

6
00:00:25,339 --> 00:00:27,070
Are you okay?

7
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:30,910
Yeah, no, I guess I was just hoping it would be so extreme.

8
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:38,700
He'll be okay. He's really fit and he looks after himself.

9
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,420
I don't know. You've heard what the doctor said about keeping him calm.

10
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:46,219
We can't let him know we're getting a divorceeeth.

11
00:00:46,219 --> 00:00:49,530
I literally kill him.

12
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,090
What are you asking?

13
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:54,280
Post-ponder divorce.

14
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:59,719
Play the loving couple with me.

15
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:01,320
It's a lot to ask.

16
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,759
Can we do it please?

17
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:06,870
For dad, I just think it's through the operation.
