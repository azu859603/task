1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,560
You think I'm in the tune?

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:09,800
Wow, um, that's my cue to go.

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:14,900
I'll see you later.

4
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:16,899
Team Leader?

5
00:00:16,899 --> 00:00:24,769
You're not going to answer my question.

6
00:00:24,769 --> 00:00:28,769
How would I know? You've never laid a finger on me in three years of marriage.

7
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:31,769
That was never part of the deal. No sex, remember?

8
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:32,899
I remember.

9
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:46,409
Wait, do you want me to touch you? Is that what this is about?

10
00:00:46,409 --> 00:00:50,369
Why are we even having this conversation?

11
00:00:50,369 --> 00:00:55,369
I agree to stay together until your father's surgery, and I'll stick to that, but this marriage is over.

12
00:00:55,369 --> 00:01:10,840
Is that why she wants a divorce? She wants her marriage to be real. I've just never thought of her like that.

13
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:31,239
It's how you've gone to work.

14
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:36,980
All this time I've never noticed my contract with wife. It's a haughty.

15
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:40,969
Maybe I am impotent.

16
00:01:40,969 --> 00:02:04,780
But what you said, you really want to throw out the rules. You really want to be with me.

17
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:08,509
I don't know anything in the law.

18
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:09,900
Just say something, sir.

19
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:13,409
I'm saying it, none. I'm going to do it better.

20
00:02:13,409 --> 00:03:34,680
I can't say, hey, Robert. What's up?

21
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,840
What do you think? Should we give Nancy the guest room or...?

22
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,569
It's up to you.

23
00:03:40,569 --> 00:03:42,569
No, no, no. You'll be here too.

24
00:03:42,569 --> 00:03:47,500
Not for much longer. Do whatever suits you, Nolan.

25
00:03:47,500 --> 00:04:04,240
I'm an old man. It's one thing for you to look after Tom's widow after he died on the job.

26
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,240
But moving her into your place, that's a lot.

27
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:17,160
She doesn't have anyone else, right? She says she's scared to be alone.

28
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:23,029
What did he just say?

29
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:26,029
Well, she said it was my call since we'll be divorcing soon.

30
00:04:26,029 --> 00:04:29,250
Yeah, about that.

31
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:33,379
Since you guys are calling your quids, how do you feel about me asking her out?

32
00:04:33,379 --> 00:04:34,379
What, Edith?

33
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:35,540
Yeah.

34
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,540
I mean, no offense, ma'am. She's harder than a bike seat in summer.

35
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:41,889
Um, well, she's her own person, so...

36
00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:44,750
I'm not going to stand in the way of that.

37
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:48,509
Cool. Thanks, ma'am.

38
00:04:48,509 --> 00:05:22,819
You are a lifesaver. Thank you for taking us in.

39
00:05:22,819 --> 00:05:31,899
Uh, yeah, no problem. Just let me know if you need any extra pillows or whatever.

40
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:32,899
Is Edith home?

41
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:35,209
Uh, must be.

42
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:42,730
Damn it. I think I got something in my eye.

43
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:58,899
Let me see.

44
00:05:58,899 --> 00:06:04,569
I have a date.

45
00:06:04,569 --> 00:06:05,569
You look great.

46
00:06:05,569 --> 00:06:10,220
Hey, man. Nice place.

47
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:13,089
Hi, Frankie.

48
00:06:13,089 --> 00:06:14,149
Nancy?

49
00:06:14,149 --> 00:06:20,339
We should go.

50
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:22,230
Sure.

51
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:42,649
Well, uh, see you at work, man. Yeah. See you at work.

52
00:06:42,649 --> 00:06:43,649
Did you cook?

53
00:06:43,649 --> 00:06:47,629
You sound surprised.

54
00:06:47,629 --> 00:06:50,819
A buddy of mine knowed me a favor, so, uh...

55
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:52,889
Let me borrow his kitchen.

56
00:06:52,889 --> 00:06:54,889
Nolan never cooks for me.

57
00:06:54,889 --> 00:07:01,720
Well, I'm not Nolan.

58
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,319
My back is so sore.

59
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:08,319
Tom used to give me the best backrops.

60
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,560
You should probably go ahead, darling.

61
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,560
Maybe I will.

62
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:23,560
You, uh, got a little...

63
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,939
right there.

64
00:07:24,939 --> 00:07:27,360
You?

65
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,360
Mm-hmm.

66
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,779
Just here.

67
00:07:29,779 --> 00:07:31,350
I know.

68
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:45,860
Hello?

69
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:46,860
Hey, um...

70
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:52,250
I thought you might want to know that...

71
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,250
Oh, um...

72
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,379
Of course.

73
00:07:54,379 --> 00:08:23,449
I'll be there as soon as I can.

74
00:08:23,449 --> 00:08:26,629
You don't deserve Nolan.

75
00:08:26,629 --> 00:08:27,629
Nolan...

76
00:08:27,629 --> 00:08:29,139
Is mine.

77
00:08:29,139 --> 00:08:35,230
How's it going to be?

78
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:36,230
Yeah!

79
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:37,230
You good?

80
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:38,230
Yeah.

81
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:39,230
Yeah.

82
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:40,230
Yeah.

83
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:42,289
Hey.

84
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:43,539
Well, I...

85
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:45,539
I didn't think I was going to see you today.

86
00:08:45,539 --> 00:08:48,830
I thought you asked me to come in.

87
00:08:50,179 --> 00:08:54,179
Um, doubters, you're saying how the doctors are really happy with these last blood results.

88
00:08:54,179 --> 00:08:59,179
Uh, I told them that I was always, uh, you know, high achiever and...

89
00:08:59,179 --> 00:09:01,179
I can't slap them now.

90
00:09:01,179 --> 00:09:02,179
That's so good.

91
00:09:02,179 --> 00:09:04,179
That's great news.

92
00:09:04,179 --> 00:09:07,309
Sorry, but, uh, we need you for more tests.

93
00:09:07,309 --> 00:09:08,309
Mr. Blair.

94
00:09:08,309 --> 00:09:09,309
Oh, okay.

95
00:09:09,309 --> 00:09:10,950
Don't worry.

96
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:11,950
We'll wait for you.

97
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:12,950
Okay.

98
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:14,720
Yeah.

99
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,799
Wait.

100
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:18,799
Yeah.

101
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:19,799
Oh, I'll go again.

102
00:09:19,799 --> 00:10:48,000
Yeah.

103
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,159
Okay.

104
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:53,159
These are to say sorry for ending our date early.

105
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:56,210
Chocolate chip.

106
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:57,210
My favorite.

107
00:10:57,210 --> 00:11:01,419
And you can make it up to me by saying yes to another date.

108
00:11:01,419 --> 00:11:06,220
Um, you got around to ordering those new masks?

109
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,220
Need it?

110
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,220
Uh, no.

111
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,220
I was going to do it tonight.

112
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:11,700
I got a nice delivery cutoff.

113
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,220
I'll probably get on to it now.

114
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,139
Sure thing, boss.

115
00:11:16,139 --> 00:11:17,139
I'll see you later.

116
00:11:17,139 --> 00:11:23,049
We had to go get some lunch, if you like.

117
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:24,500
Okay.

118
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,500
What were you thinking?

119
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,610
You are.

120
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:30,740
We have a prenatal checkup today.

121
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:31,740
Remember?

122
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:39,200
Looks like you're busy.

123
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,840
Good luck with the appointment.

124
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:53,500
I keep letting my guard down.

125
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:57,500
And he keeps reminding me why I needed up in the first place.

126
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,500
Fuck him.

127
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:05,240
He's actually the dumbest man on the planet for cheating on you with that lovely bitch.

128
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:09,019
It's him.

129
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:12,179
He's asking me out to dinner tonight.

130
00:12:12,179 --> 00:12:13,179
It's seven o'clock.

131
00:12:13,179 --> 00:12:15,600
What are you going to say?

132
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:22,820
The nurse said that these tests probably won't be done until late.

133
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:27,059
You can stay with me, though, right?

134
00:12:27,059 --> 00:12:29,570
Nolan.

135
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:35,620
I just hate doing these things alone because Tom should be here.

136
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,620
Yeah.

137
00:12:36,620 --> 00:13:05,220
This is the last time you've ever let me down.

138
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:23,980
Time is up.

139
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:30,940
Where's Nancy?

140
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:35,879
It's to shut the scene overnight.

141
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:40,860
I'm really sorry about dinner.

142
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:41,860
Did you eat?

143
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:48,759
When you didn't come home, I had some breakfast cereal.

144
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:51,789
I texted the cancel.

145
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:59,899
She'd lock it, didn't send.

146
00:13:59,899 --> 00:14:07,500
We were in the X-ray department.

147
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,500
The walls were thick down there.

148
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,840
She didn't want some pizza.

149
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:26,940
God, I love pizza.

150
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,389
I know.

151
00:14:28,389 --> 00:14:38,179
It's why I got it.

152
00:14:38,179 --> 00:14:39,179
Is that a problem?

153
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:45,620
No, it's just you usually don't care about what I like or don't like.

154
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:49,259
You probably don't even know when my birthday is.

155
00:14:49,259 --> 00:14:51,669
It's in June.

156
00:14:51,669 --> 00:14:55,519
Isn't it?

157
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:01,659
Okay, I'm not that good with dates, but not that bad.

158
00:15:01,659 --> 00:15:03,210
Am I?

159
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:07,210
All you ever care about or think about is your work.

160
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:10,429
Duty, doing the right thing for everyone else.

161
00:15:10,429 --> 00:15:16,009
We might as well be too stranger sharing this place.

162
00:15:16,009 --> 00:15:20,100
Yeah, well, I'm sorry for making you feel unimportant.

163
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:26,940
I never thought I'd hear you say something like that.

164
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:39,590
Well, I'm sorry for hurting you or neglecting you.

165
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:47,259
You deserve better.

166
00:15:47,259 --> 00:16:02,480
I just remembered I've gotten early start.

167
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,629
I'm seeing your dad tomorrow.

168
00:16:05,629 --> 00:16:08,629
Do you want me to bring him anything?

169
00:16:08,629 --> 00:16:14,100
Yeah, just tell him I'll try to get him to see him as well.

170
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:36,519
I know what you're trying to do, Edith.

171
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:37,519
But it won't work.

172
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:40,580
You've had your chance.

173
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,580
It's my time now.

174
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,710
Excuse me?

175
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:47,710
Stop clinging to Nolan.

176
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:51,610
I'm carrying his baby, Edith.

177
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:55,610
So get with the program.

178
00:16:55,610 --> 00:17:01,600
He is still my husband, Nancy.

179
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,599
What do you think people would say if they knew poor, grieving widow

180
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:11,599
had been sleeping with my husband and is now carrying his child?

181
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,599
You bitch, you wouldn't dare.

182
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:22,190
What's stopping me?

183
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:24,609
Edith, lead me alone.

184
00:17:24,609 --> 00:17:49,799
Pushed me.

185
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:50,829
You saw her.

186
00:17:50,829 --> 00:17:51,829
I did not.

187
00:17:51,829 --> 00:17:55,299
Oh, it hurts.

188
00:17:55,299 --> 00:18:08,779
Edith, please.

189
00:18:08,779 --> 00:18:31,140
You okay, man?

190
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,140
Sorry, sorry.

191
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:34,140
Do you know the severe impact?

192
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:37,960
Nancy is Miss Carrie.

193
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:41,049
You did this to me.

194
00:18:41,049 --> 00:18:43,049
You took my baby away from me.

195
00:18:43,049 --> 00:18:51,099
I didn't do anything.

196
00:18:51,099 --> 00:18:53,380
You're a horrible monster.

197
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:56,380
A horribly jealous monster.

198
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,380
She is unhinged.

199
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,380
Don't say another word.

200
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:02,079
You did here today.

201
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:04,079
He's unforgivable.

202
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:05,079
You had my son.

203
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:10,660
You discussed me.

204
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:13,660
So he won't even listen to my side, your own wife?

205
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,660
Nancy just lost her child, Edith.

206
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,730
You and I have been married for three years.

207
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:21,730
How could you ever think I would be capable of anything so vicious and ugly?

208
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:35,910
He wouldn't even listen to me, Angie, in the way he was looking at me.

209
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:38,910
Hey, who cares what that piece of shit thinks about you?

210
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:43,940
Okay, if he wants to believe that psycho bitch, then they deserve each other.

211
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,650
Okay?

212
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:46,650
What are you doing?

213
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:50,920
What does it look like, huh?

214
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:54,970
I'm staying at the fire station tonight.

215
00:19:54,970 --> 00:20:06,119
I can't be here right now.

216
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:09,119
I think you need to cancel the literacy fund raiser tomorrow.

217
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:11,119
Okay, it's just, it's too much with all of this.

218
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:14,099
I can't.

219
00:20:14,099 --> 00:20:20,619
Too many people are accounting on me.

220
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:24,380
You sure you're up for it?

221
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:27,380
It'll be good to focus on helping other people.

222
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:33,829
I need to get on with my life and stop dreaming about Nolan.

223
00:20:33,829 --> 00:20:51,230
Why would you ever say something like that about Edith?

224
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:52,650
Stay out of this.

225
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:53,650
You don't know all the facts.

226
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:54,650
I don't need to.

227
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:57,940
Edith would never attack Nancy.

228
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:58,940
Ever.

229
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:00,960
You're a joke.

230
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,960
Do you have any idea how much you're hurting her?

231
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,950
Back off.

232
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:17,769
Both of you.

233
00:21:17,769 --> 00:21:18,769
Okay, good.

234
00:21:18,769 --> 00:21:20,660
Good.

235
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:21,660
Excellent.

236
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:26,630
All right.

237
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:30,579
Thank you, son.

238
00:21:30,579 --> 00:21:37,150
Nice.

239
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:38,150
Everything okay?

240
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:41,819
Uh, yeah, you know this stuff.

241
00:21:41,819 --> 00:21:44,210
Got a lot going on right now.

242
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:50,940
You know what it is?

243
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:51,940
You're fighting?

244
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:54,289
Nothing you need to worry about that.

245
00:21:54,289 --> 00:21:56,799
It's fine.

246
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:01,250
You know, watching you find happiness with Edith.

247
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:06,630
It's made me feel less guilty with a bad example that your mother and I set for you.

248
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:07,630
We're married.

249
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:12,630
God, I lost count of how many times you guys broke up and got back together.

250
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:16,200
All the fighting.

251
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:23,740
Edith could show you what marriage really was if you gave her a chance and treated her well.

252
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:27,200
I was right.

253
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:42,990
Thank you.

254
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:44,119
Can I grab a hug?

255
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:45,119
No.

256
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:53,259
No.

257
00:22:53,259 --> 00:22:57,259
Can you believe she blamed someone else for losing her baby and it was all caught on security

258
00:22:57,259 --> 00:22:58,259
camera?

259
00:22:58,259 --> 00:23:00,380
It's messy, then.

260
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:19,720
You lied about what happened.

261
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,720
You injured yourself.

262
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,940
No.

263
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,940
Has Edith been telling more lies?

264
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:24,940
Edith never touched you.

265
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:28,099
Then how did I fall if she didn't push me?

266
00:23:28,099 --> 00:23:30,259
There's security footage, Nancy.

267
00:23:30,259 --> 00:23:34,160
Do you think that I would hurt my old child?

268
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,160
My last link to Dom.

269
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:46,059
We'll discuss this later.

270
00:23:46,059 --> 00:24:03,990
What are we dealing with?

271
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:06,150
We've got a class A fire at the community center.

272
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:07,150
Charity Ben.

273
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:15,779
Angie and Edith are there.

274
00:24:15,779 --> 00:24:20,950
Angie and Edith are there.

275
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:22,559
Hey.

276
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:28,519
We good?

277
00:24:28,519 --> 00:24:31,250
Let's go.

278
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:32,250
Let's go.

279
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:39,410
You get low and cover your case.

280
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:40,410
No.

281
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:41,410
What about you?

282
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:43,410
I'm sure everyone is out and I'll be right behind you.

283
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:44,410
Go.

284
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:57,859
Go.

285
00:24:57,859 --> 00:24:58,859
I did this still in there, okay?

286
00:24:58,859 --> 00:25:00,859
You shouldn't leave until everyone else was out.

287
00:25:00,859 --> 00:25:02,559
All right, go.

288
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:18,859
Come on.

289
00:25:18,859 --> 00:25:20,589
Can you hear me?

290
00:25:20,589 --> 00:25:26,579
Come on.

291
00:25:26,579 --> 00:25:27,579
Please eat it.

292
00:25:27,579 --> 00:25:32,519
She's still alive.

293
00:25:32,519 --> 00:26:02,799
You.

294
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:05,559
I'm fine.

295
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:06,910
Leave me alone.

296
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:08,230
Edith, you're in a fire.

297
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:11,230
You are the last person I want, helping me.

298
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:12,230
Hey.

299
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:28,279
Thank God you managed to save the books.

300
00:26:28,279 --> 00:26:31,279
I mean, it's taken Edith months to get all those donations together.

301
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:34,019
When you think we can have access to the building.

302
00:26:34,019 --> 00:26:38,420
Edith worked on a literacy fund raise of that.

303
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:41,000
Wait, why do you think we're here?

304
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,019
It's Edith's project.

305
00:26:45,019 --> 00:26:47,720
You know, ever since she became a best-selling author,

306
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:52,720
she's been donating her profits and using her profile to help people.

307
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,720
Since when was Edith the best-seller?

308
00:26:55,720 --> 00:27:01,980
Of course you don't know.

309
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:04,980
You know, I can't wait until she divorces your ass.

310
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:10,980
You can spend the rest of your life realizing just how badly you fucked up.

311
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:32,980
Hey, you feeling better?

312
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:35,549
I'll take you for a full checkup.

313
00:27:35,549 --> 00:27:37,549
Since when did you care about me?

314
00:27:37,549 --> 00:27:42,940
There's something you need to know.

315
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:46,839
There's security footage from the incident with Nancy.

316
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:52,779
It shows you never touched her.

317
00:27:52,779 --> 00:27:53,779
And?

318
00:27:53,779 --> 00:27:59,880
And I'm sorry I didn't listen to you.

319
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:05,029
It was for all the harsh bullshit that I said.

320
00:28:05,029 --> 00:28:06,029
You're right.

321
00:28:06,029 --> 00:28:08,029
I owed you better than that after all the years old now.

322
00:28:08,029 --> 00:28:10,740
I bet you feel better with that off your chest now.

323
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:11,740
What do you mean?

324
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,829
I said I'm sorry.

325
00:28:13,829 --> 00:28:18,470
Next time I ask you to trust me, I'll remember to bring this CCTV footage.

326
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:37,019
Is it possible?

327
00:28:37,019 --> 00:28:41,849
My wife has had feelings for me this whole time.

328
00:28:41,849 --> 00:28:48,490
She put the mail she cooked in the fridge.

329
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:50,490
Or when he got home to work.

330
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:54,099
He did so much for other people.

331
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:57,099
She wanted to do this small thing for him.

332
00:28:57,099 --> 00:29:07,509
Enjoy.

333
00:29:07,509 --> 00:29:14,859
One thing she loved was folding his clothes for him.

334
00:29:14,859 --> 00:29:16,859
She pretended it wasn't a big deal.

335
00:29:16,859 --> 00:29:21,859
But she loved touching his clothes, imagining him wearing them.

336
00:29:21,859 --> 00:29:23,859
I was just about to bring you these.

337
00:29:23,859 --> 00:29:26,779
It didn't have to do that.

338
00:29:26,779 --> 00:29:35,009
Her favorite moment in the day was when he came home.

339
00:29:35,009 --> 00:29:39,009
She loved his warm, brown eyes and dark hair.

340
00:29:39,009 --> 00:29:41,009
She especially loved his smile.

341
00:29:41,009 --> 00:29:42,009
Is it possible?

342
00:29:42,009 --> 00:29:45,009
My wife has had feelings for me this whole time.

343
00:29:45,009 --> 00:29:53,750
Hey.

344
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:56,549
Perfect timing.

345
00:29:56,549 --> 00:30:01,910
I'm sure it's that coming right up.

346
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:08,579
Maybe it's slightly sure it's that.

347
00:30:08,579 --> 00:30:10,579
There's maple syrup and honey if you are.

348
00:30:10,579 --> 00:30:14,509
Sorry I'm not hungry.

349
00:30:14,509 --> 00:30:34,460
Yeah, that's good.

350
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:38,460
Just once she wished he'd cook her her favorite pancakes for breakfast

351
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,460
or buy her flowers for no reason.

352
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:43,460
But she knew it was never going to happen.

353
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:47,460
Because the only thing he had room for in his life was his work.

354
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:54,420
What are these for?

355
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:56,779
The reason?

356
00:30:56,779 --> 00:31:00,349
These don't change anything.

357
00:31:00,349 --> 00:31:11,980
I'm allergic to roses.
