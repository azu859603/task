00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:04,250
Hey, did you know that, uh, he had a friend's little literacy charity?

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:06,250
No, I did not know that.

3
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:08,250
How long has that been going on?

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,560
Ah, a few years now.

5
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:15,169
You know, I've been wondering myself how you got into that.

6
00:00:15,169 --> 00:00:18,739
You don't care about all of that?

7
00:00:18,739 --> 00:00:20,739
Uh, excuse me.

8
00:00:20,739 --> 00:00:22,660
I do.

9
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:23,660
You were an old man.

10
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:30,339
Maybe another time.

11
00:00:30,339 --> 00:00:32,340
See you soon.

12
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:33,369
See you.

13
00:00:33,369 --> 00:00:41,609
Still in the dark house, huh?

14
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:46,299
How do you know I'm the one who messed up?

15
00:00:46,299 --> 00:00:49,299
I wouldn't freeze your hat like that unless you're done something bad, so...

16
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:52,820
Not bad, is it?

17
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:53,820
Yeah, I know.

18
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,799
I'm still trying to figure that one out.

19
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:05,349
Um, the question is, what's your best advice for getting in an anger moment for a given?

20
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:08,180
Huh?

21
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:12,180
What's your best advice for getting in a given moment for a given?

22
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,239
What about you just show off those muscles with yours?

23
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:16,239
Yeah, yeah.

24
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:18,239
Pilts are a primal.

25
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:21,590
It's better than a thousand words.
