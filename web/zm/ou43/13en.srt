1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I don't want to stay at your place if Edith is going to be there.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,099
It's not after what happened.

3
00:00:06,099 --> 00:00:08,099
You mean after you injured yourself?

4
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:09,099
I didn't.

5
00:00:09,099 --> 00:00:12,099
I'm not asking Edith to move out to suit you, okay?

6
00:00:12,099 --> 00:00:14,509
I'll drop you off at yours.

7
00:00:14,509 --> 00:00:19,870
That bitch, Edith, did this.

8
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:23,989
Well, I'm gonna fucking get her.

9
00:00:23,989 --> 00:00:41,579
This is my black jeans.

10
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:43,579
I can't find them anywhere.

11
00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:46,020
No, no.

12
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:56,920
Jesus.

13
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,920
Hold something.

14
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:04,569
Too much information.

15
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:08,359
Aren't you cold?

16
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:11,450
No, why?

17
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:13,730
It was bothering you.

18
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:15,730
Are you fishing for compliments?

19
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:19,329
No, just wondering if you like what you see.

20
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:21,329
What exactly do you want from anymore?
