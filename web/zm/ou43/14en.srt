1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,310
Look, with that being sick and a divorce, she's made me take another look at our marriage.

2
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:09,310
And?

3
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:16,670
I think maybe if you give me a chance, maybe we could save it.

4
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:19,670
Why would I give you another chance to ignore me for three years?

5
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:24,850
I haven't even... I haven't ignored you.

6
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:31,420
We've already established you don't know my birthday. You didn't even know I was a best-selling author and want me to keep going.

7
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:33,420
I wasn't deliberate, I was just focused on work.

8
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:39,420
You agreed to marry me because your father gave you an ultimatum to either join the family business or get married.

9
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,420
Then you blamed me for your own decision.

10
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:44,710
Do you have any idea how lonely this marriage is being for me?

11
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:50,850
No, you're right. I did blame you.

12
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,219
That was wrong.

13
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:57,960
I just said I... I never wanted to get married.

14
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:03,460
My parents pretty much hated each other, and I don't know what to mean, just seemed like a trap.

15
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:07,299
We are not your parents, Nolan.

16
00:01:07,299 --> 00:01:09,319
I read your book.

17
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:12,609
No. It was really good.

18
00:01:12,609 --> 00:01:16,700
Funny you from my antique. Pretty sexy too.

19
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:19,700
You're not exactly the target market.

20
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,269
I see a lot of you in it.

21
00:01:22,269 --> 00:01:25,549
I just wanted to get to know you even more.

22
00:01:25,549 --> 00:01:31,549
Look, I know I hurt you, but if you just give me a chance, I think we could have something really special here.
