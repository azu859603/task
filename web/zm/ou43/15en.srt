1
00:00:01,419 --> 00:00:05,019
I can't believe you're asking me to forget everything that you've done.

2
00:00:05,019 --> 00:00:08,619
No, not forget. Just forgive.

3
00:00:08,619 --> 00:00:13,519
Please just give me a chance and I can make it up to you for everything.

4
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:19,510
Bye!

5
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:21,839
Some things are unforgivable.

6
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:23,839
You should be spending time with me answering.

7
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:25,940
I don't want to be, we can't see. I'm here with you.

8
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:29,379
How can you say that when you just lost your child?

9
00:00:29,379 --> 00:00:32,990
What?

10
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:33,990
All right.

11
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:38,090
Given the circumstances, I think the best thing is to just stick to the plan.

12
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:40,890
We wait till your father's over his operation and we get a divorce.

13
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:47,890
And I'd appreciate it. If there are no more pancakes or you walking around like this, it doesn't help.

14
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:54,679
Wait, you think that's just having my baby?
