1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
But we need it. Wait.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,990
You think Nancy's having my baby?

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:07,990
I don't want to hear your excuses, Ellen.

4
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:09,990
Well, it seems to me.

5
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:12,789
I wouldn't even think to touch Nancy.

6
00:00:12,789 --> 00:00:17,219
You've got to take this.

7
00:00:17,219 --> 00:00:20,640
Best-selling author accused of plagiarism?

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:32,340
Self-published author Nancy claims she wrote the book about her deceased husband, Tom, who died heroically fighting a fire.

9
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,340
That lying bitch!

10
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:37,340
People are gonna crucify me, Angie.

11
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:39,340
Other authors are already denouncing me.

12
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:41,340
We will find a way to clear your name.

13
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,340
Okay, I promise.

14
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:55,939
Good. They got the photo I sent them.

15
00:00:56,939 --> 00:01:15,290
Take my man.

16
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:19,290
Oh, I'm gonna take everything you have.
