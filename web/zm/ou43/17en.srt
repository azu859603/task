00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:05,790
So, what did your publisher say?

2
00:00:06,309 --> 00:00:10,470
They believe me, but they've withdrawn my book until I can prove that I've wrote it.

3
00:00:11,029 --> 00:00:12,390
It is.

4
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:17,140
I drew it to me. Oh my god! I drew it? What the fuck?

5
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:19,140
My eyes are in. It's okay. It's okay.

6
00:00:19,539 --> 00:00:26,210
How are your eyes feeling now?

7
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:30,199
Much better.

8
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:32,840
Thank you for coming over so quickly.

9
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,770
I was so scared when my eyes started burning.

10
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:42,579
You were so lucky. Whatever you need it is. I'm here for you, okay?

11
00:00:42,579 --> 00:00:45,350
We both are.

12
00:00:45,350 --> 00:01:11,510
Nancy's the writer. What's this bullshit?

13
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:17,379
Either.

14
00:01:17,379 --> 00:01:20,599
Say the rest, sell it.

15
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:25,189
I mean, it's work.

16
00:01:25,189 --> 00:01:29,189
Your wife's just been attacked because of Nancy's lies and you're here playing in your phone?

17
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:32,189
No, hang on. Nancy didn't even fucking like this stuff.
