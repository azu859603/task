1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,600
No, hang on. Nancy didn't even fucking write this stuff.

2
00:00:04,209 --> 00:00:05,089
What the fuck, man?

3
00:00:05,089 --> 00:00:07,330
If you're not gonna look after Rita, then I will.

4
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:08,769
It's a fucking backup.

5
00:00:08,769 --> 00:00:10,609
She's my white asshole.

6
00:00:10,609 --> 00:00:11,970
Then act like a husband.

7
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,449
She could have gone blind tonight from those attacks.

8
00:00:14,449 --> 00:00:15,609
Attack?

9
00:00:15,609 --> 00:00:26,899
Edith! Edith! Edith, you okay?

10
00:00:26,899 --> 00:00:39,420
I don't know when I'll be back.

11
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,189
Or even if I will be back.

12
00:00:42,189 --> 00:00:49,479
Hey, where is she?

13
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:50,880
Frankie said she'd been attacked.

14
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,240
Okay, she's not here.

15
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,679
And even if she was, she does not want to speak to you.

16
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:57,659
Put in.

17
00:00:57,659 --> 00:00:59,259
Now I want to see for myself that she's okay.

18
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:01,020
Why do you suddenly care?

19
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,819
You are honestly the worst thing that has ever happened to Edith.

20
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:05,700
And you know what?

21
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,620
I can't wait till that divorce is final

22
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,939
and you're left with that sick bitch, Nancy.

23
00:01:09,939 --> 00:01:11,859
You two deserve each other.

24
00:01:11,859 --> 00:01:17,870
No, wait, hang on a second.

25
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:19,950
When is all of this gonna be over?

26
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:26,659
You know what you need?

27
00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:28,560
Some bambering.

28
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,599
And you have come to the right means.
