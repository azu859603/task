00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome to our very own days of life.

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,439
You're thinking about him again, aren't you?

3
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:12,439
Thinking about the day I really fell for him.

4
00:00:12,439 --> 00:00:24,289
Just because you've got no friends doesn't mean you can take over a whole table just for yourself.

5
00:00:24,289 --> 00:00:26,289
Oh, I'm sorry.

6
00:00:26,289 --> 00:00:37,570
Sorry, I'm late.

7
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:41,850
This table's taken. I find another one.

8
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:44,479
Thank you.

9
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:47,500
And a problem.

10
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:53,500
I hadn't seen him since we were kids, and he still jumped in to save me.

11
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:58,270
When his father called and suggested we marry.

12
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:02,549
I thought it was a dream come true.

13
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:04,549
So stupid.
