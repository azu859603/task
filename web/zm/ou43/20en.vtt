00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.710
I didn't think I'd see you again after you brought me off from the hospital.

2
00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:16.620
Well, let's not talk about that, okay?

3
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.620
I heard Edith disappeared on you.

4
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.859
She has no idea how lucky she is.

5
00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:23.620
I don't want to think about her either.

6
00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:25.420
But while you're here.

7
00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:26.420
You're right.

8
00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.420
That's not waste anytime.

9
00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.989
That reminds me.

10
00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:37.020
Okay.

11
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.630
For your widow's pension, yeah?

12
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:40.630
Sure.

13
00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:41.630
No.

14
00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:42.630
Where do I sign?

15
00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:01.969
You know your handwriting looks nothing like the manuscript you put online to prove you

16
00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:04.439
wrote a textbook.

17
00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.439
Might as well admit it.

18
00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:06.569
You're the plagiarist.

19
00:01:06.569 --> 00:01:07.569
Not Edith.
