1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,600
You're the plagiarist, not Edith.

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:04,240
What handwriting changes? That doesn't prove anything.

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,240
Edith has a dozen other manuscripts in the same handwriting that proves this book is hers.

4
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:11,119
This bullshit isn't going to convince anyone.

5
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:12,880
Why are you talking to me like this?

6
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:18,960
Hey, Tom, chose you, trusted you, over everyone to look after me.

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,640
No, don't. Don't bring Thomas.

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,260
Well, he thought you were his friend. He made you promise on his deathbed to look after me.

9
00:00:27,179 --> 00:00:29,019
You're supposed to protect me.

10
00:00:29,019 --> 00:00:32,060
The only person I'm protecting is Edith, my wife.

11
00:00:33,009 --> 00:00:36,049
You're seriously going to choose her over me.

12
00:00:39,229 --> 00:00:42,590
You have 24 hours to publicly apologize, Edith, or I will

13
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:44,350
sue you for defamation and slander.

14
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:46,820
Is that serious enough for you?

15
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:55,420
Fire down town. We're rolling.

16
00:00:56,979 --> 00:01:04,909
24 hours, Nancy.
