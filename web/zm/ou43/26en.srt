1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,600
You killed Andy!

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:04,540
That wasn't me. I've been on a fire all night with my whole crew.

3
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:06,500
I saw your car!

4
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,339
It just listened to me. Frankie was with me the whole time. He'll tell you.

5
00:00:10,339 --> 00:00:13,500
No, no. I know what I saw. I know what you texted.

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,599
You killed Andy because you thought she was me.

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,300
You just wanted to get rid of me so you could be with Nancy.

8
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,460
I can't want to get rid of you, Ed. Please.

9
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:24,339
You're not making sense.

10
00:00:24,339 --> 00:00:25,839
No, don't touch me.

11
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:29,839
Just listen to me. My car was at the station. My phone was...

12
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:35,979
My car keys, my phone. They were on my bunk when I left.

13
00:00:35,979 --> 00:00:37,280
I mean, someone could have taken them.

14
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,479
I'm not listening to the bullshit.

15
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:40,479
Oh, Nancy. Nancy was there when I got the call out.

16
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:42,609
I mean, she could have taken my car.

17
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:47,109
Even if it was her, it's still your fault, and he is dead.

18
00:00:47,109 --> 00:00:51,109
You let that voice and the psycho into our lives. This is all on you.

19
00:00:51,109 --> 00:00:55,000
Thank you.
