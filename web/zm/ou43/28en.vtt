00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I'm going through with the divorce, this pathetic marriage is over.

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.000
You don't mean that.

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.030
Give me a little more time to fix things, please.

4
00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:09.029
Okay, you bring Angie back to life?

5
00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:14.029
Because that is what it's going to take for me to be in the same room as you.

6
00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:17.030
Don't you understand what you've done, Angie?

7
00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.739
Angie is dead.

8
00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:22.960
I'm so sorry.

9
00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.730
Let her go.

10
00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.730
Back off, you've done enough.

11
00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.469
That's why I want to help.

12
00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:35.469
You've been a shit husband to her, hurting her over and over.

13
00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:37.920
She doesn't want you near a Nolan.

14
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.920
You know, the least you could do would be to listen to her when she says, leave her alone.

15
00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.920
I need to do something.

16
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.920
Her best friend is dead.

17
00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.979
Angie is dead.

18
00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:49.979
Angie is gone.

19
00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:55.920
You want to do something right for once?

20
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.920
Make sure you catch her and do this.
