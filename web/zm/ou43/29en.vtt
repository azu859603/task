00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:07.769
Going somewhere?

2
00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:08.859
No one.

3
00:00:08.859 --> 00:00:09.859
You scared me.

4
00:00:09.859 --> 00:00:11.859
How did you get in here?

5
00:00:11.859 --> 00:00:14.820
It doesn't matter.

6
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.820
What matters is that you killed Angie.

7
00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.820
I don't know what you're talking about.

8
00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.820
You stole my phone in my car.

9
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.820
You texted either to find out where she was but when you got there...

10
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.910
You killed Angie cause you thought it was either.

11
00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.910
Why are you being so awful to me?

12
00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.910
Isn't it enough that I already lost my house?

13
00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:32.909
No, this has nothing to do with Tom!

14
00:00:32.909 --> 00:00:36.329
Well you have Tom to the fire when he died.

15
00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.450
How do you think people are gonna react when they...

16
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.450
Here, that you are trying to blame me for your crimes.

17
00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.469
Tom didn't die who he is.

18
00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:50.079
He had a drug note.

19
00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:52.500
He was high on drugs the night of the fire.

20
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.500
That's why he died.

21
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.500
No!

22
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.500
Don't pretend like he didn't know.

23
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.500
There's no way he could have been that addicted and you had no idea.

24
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.500
I did it!

25
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.500
Do you ever tell the truth?
