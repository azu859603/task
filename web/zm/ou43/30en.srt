1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,600
Do you ever tell the truth?

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:05,019
Why are you being so horrible to me?

3
00:00:05,019 --> 00:00:08,019
I did my best to help you because of Tom.

4
00:00:08,019 --> 00:00:11,630
I broke Edith's heart a hundred times to be there for you.

5
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:14,820
How did you repay me?

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,820
You like to eat it that I got you pregnant?

7
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:17,820
What, and killing Angie?

8
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,820
You can't prove anything.

9
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,820
These are just stories that you're making up

10
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:25,820
because your stupid bitch wife wants to divorce you

11
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:27,820
and you don't want it to be your fault!

12
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:32,859
You're right.

13
00:00:32,859 --> 00:00:33,859
I can't prove it.

14
00:00:33,859 --> 00:00:37,780
Yet, but I will.

15
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:42,600
In the meantime, I'll be suing you for defending Edith.

16
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,829
Seeing court.

17
00:00:47,829 --> 00:00:52,679
My husband is a hero!

18
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:57,119
Then no one is going to believe you over me.

19
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:00,619
His husband is a hero.
