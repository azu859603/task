00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.520
No, none of this is your fault.

2
00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:03.279
Yes, it is.

3
00:00:03.279 --> 00:00:05.639
It is my fault for loving you for so long

4
00:00:05.639 --> 00:00:07.000
when you treated me like dirt.

5
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.240
It's my fault for wasting so much time

6
00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.410
if I just listened to energy just still real life.

7
00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:17.500
It's gonna be okay.

8
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.710
I've got her.

9
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.550
So am I.

10
00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.469
She told you to leave her alone.

11
00:00:23.469 --> 00:00:26.469
You're only supposed to talk to her through a lawyer, okay?

12
00:00:26.469 --> 00:00:28.469
How about you stay out of my marriage?

13
00:00:28.469 --> 00:00:30.550
You're getting into wars.

14
00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.109
Maybe if you backed off and still have a chance

15
00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:32.950
to work things out.

16
00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.750
I'm not interested in either of you.

17
00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.950
I just buried my best friend.

18
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.140
See, back off.

19
00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.829
You first.

20
00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:47.630
I can't wait for our divorce to come through.

21
00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.990
I really can't.

22
00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:51.350
You're getting into wars.
