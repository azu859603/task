1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:05,219
Our marriage has never really been happy.

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,120
No one always resented me.

3
00:00:07,219 --> 00:00:09,820
Well, that's because I forced him into marriage

4
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:12,849
like a stubborn old man.

5
00:00:12,949 --> 00:00:20,739
You were trying to help him.

6
00:00:20,839 --> 00:00:26,530
You know, after he couldn't save his mother from that fire,

7
00:00:26,629 --> 00:00:33,049
he became obsessed never to let that happen to anyone else.

8
00:00:33,049 --> 00:00:38,549
Nolan is the most dedicated fireman I know.

9
00:00:38,649 --> 00:00:44,159
And I hoped having a wife, starting a family,

10
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:46,320
I hoped it would change that.

11
00:00:47,539 --> 00:00:53,219
Maybe I just wasn't enough of an incentive for him to change.

12
00:00:53,609 --> 00:00:57,039
No, never say that to you go.

13
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:03,619
You were so, so lucky to have you.

14
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:09,180
Now, you tell me what you want to happen next, hmm?

15
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:13,290
Don't hold back on my account.

16
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:36,329
Thank you, for everything.

17
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,230
What have you been talking about for so long?

18
00:01:38,329 --> 00:01:40,480
I told her to divorce you.

19
00:01:40,579 --> 00:01:42,870
Chat has.

20
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:43,969
You what?
