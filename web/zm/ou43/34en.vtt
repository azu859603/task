1
00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:28.760
I used to believe in happy ever after, in love conquering all, but real life isn't fair

2
00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:29.760
tale.

3
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.729
I wanted to believe we could rekindle what we lost, but sometimes the flames burn too

4
00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:37.399
bright.

5
00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:40.850
Angie, I miss you so much.

6
00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.939
I'm so sorry you got caught up in my mess.

7
00:00:43.939 --> 00:01:06.590
If I could take it back, I'd do everything different.

8
00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:29.209
I need a favor.

9
00:01:29.209 --> 00:01:34.370
Angie's parents asked me to pack up her place.

10
00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.780
Is that what you wanted to ask me about?

11
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.620
Because I'm happy to help out.

12
00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.859
No, it's something else.

13
00:01:43.859 --> 00:02:01.069
When he gives a drink, he can fill me in.

14
00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:02.620
You're usually wearing hair.

15
00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:03.620
Good question.

16
00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.280
Edithites call.

17
00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:23.099
You just waste your money for a raspberry, right?

18
00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:24.099
People change.

19
00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:26.060
No one.

20
00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.060
She asks you to go?

21
00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.060
No one?

22
00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.060
It's about Nancy, because...

23
00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.280
It's about Tom.

24
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.800
I looked up the rules for Nancy's widow's pension.

25
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.560
If Tom's drug addiction comes out, she loses everything.

26
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.030
I've told her about the drugs.

27
00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.909
You're still protecting Nancy, unbelievable.

28
00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:46.270
And trying to protect Tom, okay, who isn't around to defend himself.

29
00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:47.949
What about Angie?

30
00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:51.110
That murderous bitch Nancy thinks she's gotten away with what she did.

31
00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.550
This is the only way I can make her pay, and I don't care if that means trashing Tom's

32
00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:56.550
precious reputation.

33
00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:57.550
No, no, no.

34
00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.430
There has to be another way.

35
00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.699
Look at the great team later, defending his man until the end.

36
00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:13.449
Angie was on your team too, no one.

37
00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:17.740
She's not to stay at Angie's, it's probably full of sad memories.

38
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:18.740
Stay at home now.

39
00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:19.740
I'll stay at Dad's.

40
00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.060
What?

41
00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:26.960
What's out?

42
00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:31.219
Idiot.

43
00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:40.620
I'll move back.

44
00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:41.710
Thank you.

45
00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:48.969
You think you could come home early tonight?

46
00:03:48.969 --> 00:03:49.969
Yeah.

47
00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:53.419
I can get some stuff at dinner, if you like.

48
00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:55.419
I don't care about food.

49
00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:57.419
We need to discuss the divorce.

50
00:03:57.419 --> 00:04:12.860
This is the talk screening from Tom's autopsy.

51
00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:22.170
I know you love Tom, but you've been protecting him long enough.

52
00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:30.589
Hey, get a seat if she hates me too much to accept it from me.

53
00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:42.160
Where's Nolan?

54
00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.579
He asked me to give you this.

55
00:04:44.579 --> 00:04:53.089
This will prove that Tom was in breach of the fire frighters code when he died.

56
00:04:53.089 --> 00:04:58.350
They'll cancel his pension straight away.

57
00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:59.350
Thank you.

58
00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:04.209
Look, I really want to...

59
00:05:04.209 --> 00:05:07.779
I'm sorry, I have to get back to the station.

60
00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:11.230
But I'd really like to take you out to dinner sometime.

61
00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:13.230
I like that.

62
00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:23.089
I can't believe no one's going to blow me off again.

63
00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:30.180
Howard, we're not turning out.

64
00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.810
I'm going to change anything either.

65
00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:45.670
I'm going to divorce me, and I don't know how to stop it.

66
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:46.670
Where's Dad?

67
00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:49.019
He said it was emergency.

68
00:05:49.019 --> 00:05:53.019
I asked him to call you because I knew you wouldn't come on your own.

69
00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:59.500
I'll save you reading them.

70
00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.500
I don't want the house, or your car, or your money.

71
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:08.300
I just want you out of my life as soon as possible.

72
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:31.129
If I hadn't been such a bad husband, things could have been so different.

73
00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:33.449
Well, what's good from you?

74
00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:35.449
Your favorite?

75
00:06:35.449 --> 00:06:37.600
Yeah.

76
00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:58.860
Oh, my favorite.

77
00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:06.220
Better than that.

78
00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:09.220
Please just sign so we can both get home without our lives.

79
00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:13.430
It doesn't have to be this way.

80
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:15.819
It's too late, Nolan.

81
00:07:15.819 --> 00:07:19.420
You've hurt me too much.

82
00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:22.420
If you care about me at all, just give me my freedom.

83
00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:51.040
Thank you.

84
00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:59.750
Where are you going?

85
00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:04.439
I don't know yet.

86
00:08:04.439 --> 00:08:06.560
Stay here.

87
00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.560
I want you to have these places.

88
00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:10.660
Zero home more than mine stuff.

89
00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:13.899
I suppose that's true.

90
00:08:13.899 --> 00:08:17.779
You're wearing never here.

91
00:08:17.779 --> 00:08:19.839
All right.

92
00:08:19.839 --> 00:08:21.060
I'll take it.

93
00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:22.060
Thank you.

94
00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:27.110
I guess it's goodbye to him.

95
00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:32.600
Hey, I'm Simon because I know that's what you'd want.

96
00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:37.490
I want you to feel like a troll at what happens next.

97
00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:41.379
I want it to be your choice.

98
00:08:41.379 --> 00:08:43.379
Where are you talking about?

99
00:08:43.379 --> 00:08:45.379
Give me three months to change your mind about yours.

100
00:08:45.379 --> 00:08:47.429
Three months.

101
00:08:47.429 --> 00:08:51.960
Just give me a chance to turn things around.

102
00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:56.240
If you still want to follow divorce papers after that then.

103
00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:03.529
I can file them right now and this will be over.

104
00:09:03.529 --> 00:09:05.529
All I'm asking for is a chance.

105
00:09:05.529 --> 00:09:08.360
I used to make it up to you for everything.

106
00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:42.419
Wait, give it to me?

107
00:09:42.419 --> 00:09:43.580
Fucker you doing here.

108
00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:45.580
Please, Frankie, you gotta help me.

109
00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:46.580
Why would I do that?

110
00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:47.580
For Tom.

111
00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:50.580
I know he saved your life more than once when you were a rookie.

112
00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:54.240
What do you want?

113
00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:58.299
If no one has proof they can discredit Tom, I'm gonna lose everything.

114
00:09:58.299 --> 00:10:01.750
I've already lost Tom and the baby.

115
00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:09.980
I just need to destroy any evidence of Tom on drugs.

116
00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:10.980
Think about it.

117
00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:13.100
Please.

118
00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:14.100
For Tom.

119
00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:19.460
For Edith.

120
00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:21.460
I overheard everything she said.

121
00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:22.460
Tell her you'll do it.

122
00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:24.460
Oh, but she killed Angie.

123
00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:25.460
Is that her?

124
00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:29.460
Tell her you'll meet her in the radio room tomorrow and you'll hand over the evidence.

125
00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:33.500
Okay, and then what?

126
00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:46.480
It's time to make her pay.

127
00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:47.480
Things are going my way.

128
00:10:47.480 --> 00:11:05.580
Why are you waiting for something?

129
00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:06.580
What?

130
00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:07.580
What's going on, Frankie?

131
00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:08.769
Nothing.

132
00:11:08.769 --> 00:11:09.769
All good.

133
00:11:09.769 --> 00:11:22.100
You wanna do the next step?

134
00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:24.100
He's a shit, Frankie.

135
00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:27.720
Oh, Nancy.

136
00:11:29.299 --> 00:11:30.299
Looking for this?

137
00:11:30.299 --> 00:11:33.149
Hello, Nancy.

138
00:11:33.149 --> 00:11:35.379
Looking for this?

139
00:11:35.379 --> 00:11:37.379
It's amazing Tom could walk that night.

140
00:11:37.379 --> 00:11:39.379
He had so many drugs in the system.

141
00:11:39.379 --> 00:11:40.379
Give me that.

142
00:11:40.379 --> 00:11:43.379
Not until you admit you killed Angie and framed me for plagiarism.

143
00:11:43.379 --> 00:11:44.379
How do I know that?

144
00:11:44.379 --> 00:11:51.840
I know they'll never be able to prosecute you because you got rid of all the evidence, but I need to hear you say it.

145
00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:53.480
All right.

146
00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:57.590
But it was supposed to be you.

147
00:11:57.590 --> 00:11:59.590
She had that stupid face.

148
00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:00.590
You didn't say anything about me.

149
00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:01.590
Oh, yeah.

150
00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:02.590
All the police.

151
00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:07.139
And the plagiarism.

152
00:12:07.139 --> 00:12:10.139
I'm so fucking proud of you and her hair.

153
00:12:10.139 --> 00:12:16.139
What better way to hurt you than steal your book and tell everyone that it was mine.

154
00:12:16.139 --> 00:12:18.659
Now, give me that.

155
00:12:18.659 --> 00:12:19.659
Sure.

156
00:12:19.659 --> 00:12:20.820
Why not?

157
00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:22.820
I've already got enough witnesses to your confession.

158
00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:25.580
Oh.

159
00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:26.740
That?

160
00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:27.740
That's just a copy.

161
00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:30.629
Oh, you bitch.

162
00:12:30.629 --> 00:12:34.200
I'm gonna kill you.

163
00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:38.590
No!

164
00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:42.320
I'm gonna kill you.

165
00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:46.330
No!

166
00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:47.330
You're about to lose everything.

167
00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:48.330
You're home.

168
00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:49.330
You're freedom.

169
00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:51.330
All the sympathy you've been milking as Tom's widow.

170
00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:54.330
Don't let her do this to me.

171
00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:56.330
You and I would be so much better together.

172
00:12:56.330 --> 00:13:00.330
How can you choose this pathetic bitch over me?

173
00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:02.490
I never chosen.

174
00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:04.490
Not even once.

175
00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:05.490
What's going on here?

176
00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:06.490
Frank.

177
00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:07.490
Franky.

178
00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:10.490
You know how much I suffered half the time, guys.

179
00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:12.490
Don't listen to their lives.

180
00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:13.490
None of it's true.

181
00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:15.490
No one will ever believe you again.

182
00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:18.490
You killed Angie and your own child.

183
00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:20.490
You're an vicious, twisted monster.

184
00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:32.669
And they're gonna lock you up and throw away the key.

185
00:13:32.669 --> 00:13:33.669
No one.

186
00:13:33.669 --> 00:13:34.669
No one.

187
00:13:34.669 --> 00:13:35.669
Please.

188
00:13:35.669 --> 00:13:52.960
I love you.

189
00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:53.960
Please.

190
00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:55.950
I'm hurting you.

191
00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:56.950
No, it's fine.

192
00:13:56.950 --> 00:13:58.659
You should really go to the hospital.

193
00:13:58.659 --> 00:14:02.350
It's not that deep.

194
00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:03.350
No, she out.

195
00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:06.759
She missed everything important.

196
00:14:06.759 --> 00:14:13.019
Why did you risk your life like that?

197
00:14:13.019 --> 00:14:18.509
What would your father do if you died?

198
00:14:18.509 --> 00:14:20.950
What about you?

199
00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:25.000
Did you be upset if I died?

200
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
Listen, I don't want you to die.

201
00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.419
No, that's not what I asked.

202
00:14:32.419 --> 00:14:34.419
When we signed those divorce papers,

203
00:14:34.419 --> 00:14:39.500
asked you to give me more chance.

204
00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:40.500
You didn't say no.

205
00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:43.220
I just figured that.

206
00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:46.279
That was still hope for us.

207
00:14:46.279 --> 00:14:53.460
Don't let us go.

208
00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:56.220
Come on.

209
00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:57.220
Tell her.

210
00:14:57.220 --> 00:15:04.899
Nancy Anderson has pleaded diminished capacity

211
00:15:04.899 --> 00:15:06.899
due to mental illness.

212
00:15:06.899 --> 00:15:09.899
Please tell me you're not letting her claim insanity.

213
00:15:09.899 --> 00:15:12.899
She has been diagnosed with multiple

214
00:15:12.899 --> 00:15:14.899
anti-social personality disorders.

215
00:15:14.899 --> 00:15:16.899
The court has ordered that she be confined

216
00:15:16.899 --> 00:15:20.120
to a psychiatric institute indefinitely.

217
00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:23.470
But she could still get out?

218
00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:26.240
No, Mrs. Blair.

219
00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:29.820
It's unlikely Nancy will ever be released.

220
00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:34.220
Then Angie has her justice.

221
00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:36.440
Thank you.

222
00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:46.730
Hey, how'd it go?

223
00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:50.919
Nancy is being sent to a psychiatric hospital

224
00:15:50.919 --> 00:15:54.080
probably for the rest of her life.

225
00:15:56.200 --> 00:16:00.409
That's great news.

226
00:16:00.409 --> 00:16:02.409
Listen, if I was thinking maybe...

227
00:16:02.409 --> 00:16:03.409
Hey.

228
00:16:03.409 --> 00:16:18.279
Hopefully they'll hold our table for lunch still.

229
00:16:18.279 --> 00:16:19.919
Mine too late.

230
00:16:19.919 --> 00:16:29.600
She already moved on with someone new.

231
00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:30.600
I need your help.

232
00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:34.549
I've tried everything with Edith,

233
00:16:34.549 --> 00:16:36.669
but I don't know.

234
00:16:36.669 --> 00:16:37.669
She just wanted me back in.

235
00:16:37.669 --> 00:16:41.429
Leave it with me.

236
00:16:41.429 --> 00:16:42.429
I'll give her a call.

237
00:16:42.429 --> 00:16:44.820
See if she's willing to talk.

238
00:16:44.820 --> 00:17:27.539
Yeah.

239
00:17:27.539 --> 00:17:28.539
Nice work.

240
00:17:28.539 --> 00:17:31.180
Well, you better have finished changing up.

241
00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:33.920
Edith said she's going to be here at seven.

242
00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:47.339
Okay?

243
00:17:47.339 --> 00:17:49.339
She's not coming as she.

244
00:17:49.339 --> 00:17:51.170
I didn't invite her.

245
00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:52.170
I'm sorry, son.

246
00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:54.130
I...

247
00:17:54.130 --> 00:17:56.130
What did you do to experience your marriage?

248
00:17:56.130 --> 00:17:58.960
I had felt...

249
00:17:58.960 --> 00:17:59.960
buried a throat...

250
00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:06.730
for many years.

251
00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:08.730
You're the one who taught me how to be a bad husband.

252
00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:40.779
You don't even know I came to it for advice.

253
00:18:40.779 --> 00:18:42.819
I haven't too long.

254
00:18:42.819 --> 00:18:44.819
It's just to tend to light us from writing too much.

255
00:18:44.819 --> 00:18:45.819
Hmm.

256
00:18:45.819 --> 00:18:48.259
What are you doing here, Nolan?

257
00:18:48.259 --> 00:18:51.839
I can't stay at Dad's dorms for the station.

258
00:18:51.839 --> 00:18:55.789
Can I stay here tonight?

259
00:18:55.789 --> 00:18:57.269
Just one night.

260
00:18:57.269 --> 00:18:58.269
I promise.

261
00:18:58.269 --> 00:19:03.220
You can have the couch.

262
00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:04.339
Thanks.

263
00:19:04.339 --> 00:19:07.500
I can put those wiffy for that house.

264
00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:10.000
Yeah.

265
00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.000
That'd be good.

266
00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.819
I'm just gonna grab a quick shower.

267
00:19:14.819 --> 00:19:45.359
Edith, you okay?

268
00:19:45.359 --> 00:19:46.359
I thought you slipped.

269
00:19:46.359 --> 00:19:51.210
I knocked the shampoo over.

270
00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:52.210
Oh.

271
00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:54.140
Sorry.

272
00:19:54.140 --> 00:20:00.700
I'm embarrassing.

273
00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:11.880
You need help?

274
00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:14.960
It's fine.

275
00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:23.299
You really have changed, haven't you?

276
00:20:23.299 --> 00:20:25.940
You know that saying?

277
00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:29.180
No, he got into what's gone.

278
00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:32.069
I understand.

279
00:20:32.069 --> 00:20:36.630
I had the greatest gift in the world.

280
00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:37.630
And I threw it away.

281
00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:41.349
Hmm.

282
00:20:41.349 --> 00:20:45.710
Just a kiss.

283
00:20:45.710 --> 00:21:00.440
What do you want?

284
00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:08.990
I mean, going to bed.

285
00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:15.299
I know I hurt you.

286
00:21:15.299 --> 00:21:17.299
I know I missed a chance just to get it right.

287
00:21:17.299 --> 00:21:41.180
Hey.

288
00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:49.579
I thought you were working on your book.

289
00:21:49.579 --> 00:21:51.339
It's finished.

290
00:21:51.339 --> 00:21:52.339
Are you happy?

291
00:21:52.339 --> 00:21:55.329
I dedicated it to you, Jay.

292
00:21:55.329 --> 00:21:57.779
I think it's the best thing I've ever written.

293
00:21:57.779 --> 00:21:59.289
I'm so happy for you.

294
00:21:59.289 --> 00:22:01.859
You're amazing.

295
00:22:01.859 --> 00:22:04.200
Edith, I promise you.

296
00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:07.619
I'm not a chair shoeing up in the way you deserve now.

297
00:22:07.619 --> 00:22:08.619
You're amazing.

298
00:22:08.619 --> 00:22:10.380
Edith, I promise you.

299
00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:14.630
I'm not a chair shoeing up in the way you deserve now.

300
00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:19.109
Edith, I know I promise to be a good husband.

301
00:22:19.109 --> 00:22:30.019
Frankie, there's no easy way to say this.

302
00:22:30.019 --> 00:22:46.460
So I'll just say it.

303
00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:50.470
I'm getting back with you.

304
00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:51.470
I don't know you.

305
00:22:51.470 --> 00:23:00.170
If I do, it'll take a long time for me to trust you.

306
00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:03.130
You might never be at the team.

307
00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:04.480
I'm happy to wait.

308
00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:06.480
You're worth it.

309
00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:13.490
I know what it's like to wait for someone you care about.

310
00:23:13.490 --> 00:23:19.089
I know what it's like to wait for someone you care about.

311
00:23:19.089 --> 00:23:21.089
I don't want to do that to you.

312
00:23:21.089 --> 00:23:25.779
I'm sorry if you hurt me.

313
00:23:25.779 --> 00:23:31.779
Don't be a stranger, okay?

314
00:23:31.779 --> 00:23:38.609
My manuscript isn't in here.

315
00:23:38.609 --> 00:23:46.660
Head over the back, asshole.

316
00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:47.980
Make me.

317
00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:48.980
What is he?

318
00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:56.609
I think we should call the police.

319
00:23:56.609 --> 00:23:57.609
What if he's hurt?

320
00:23:57.609 --> 00:23:59.609
No one knows how to handle himself.

321
00:23:59.609 --> 00:24:03.180
No, I've got a bad feeling about this.

322
00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:04.180
Trust me.

323
00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:05.750
It'll be fine.

324
00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:18.779
Sorry.

325
00:24:18.779 --> 00:24:20.980
He took so long at that.

326
00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:22.650
He didn't give it up.

327
00:24:22.650 --> 00:24:25.319
I can't believe you did that.

328
00:24:25.319 --> 00:24:28.420
This manuscript needs everything to me.

329
00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:30.420
The thought of losing it.

330
00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:34.240
So I had to get it back.

331
00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:37.549
Thank you, Nolan.

332
00:24:37.549 --> 00:24:45.029
I was asked if you cared if I died.

333
00:24:45.029 --> 00:24:48.400
You didn't answer.

334
00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:52.130
The answer was yes.

335
00:24:52.130 --> 00:25:06.309
And you can't hide, no.

336
00:25:06.309 --> 00:25:07.309
Please, Frankie help!

337
00:25:07.309 --> 00:25:14.460
You're still right this time.

338
00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:21.319
I can't help you.

339
00:25:21.319 --> 00:25:22.319
I'm sorry.

340
00:25:22.319 --> 00:25:23.319
Do you?

341
00:25:23.319 --> 00:25:34.460
Please.

342
00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:35.460
I'm sorry.

343
00:25:35.460 --> 00:26:47.279
You deserve better.

344
00:26:47.279 --> 00:26:48.279
You deserve better.

345
00:26:48.279 --> 00:28:10.809
Thank you for coming, Frankie.

346
00:28:10.809 --> 00:28:12.809
Take care of yourselves.

347
00:28:12.809 --> 00:28:43.099
I thought we had more time.

348
00:28:43.099 --> 00:29:09.980
Do you smell that?

349
00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:13.890
It's like...
