1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I can't believe I'm marrying a man I've only met once.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Take the car. The password is $6.60.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
It's as bad as you like.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,099
I'm going to hire you to get to Europe for business.

5
00:00:09,099 --> 00:00:10,099
I'll contact you when I get back.

6
00:00:10,099 --> 00:00:13,099
There is no need to. I've got enough money.

7
00:00:13,099 --> 00:00:18,440
You can leave me money right after getting our marriage license.

8
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:22,179
This still does only to please his parents.

9
00:00:22,179 --> 00:00:26,179
But does he or he want to spend the rest of his life with me?

10
00:00:26,179 --> 00:00:30,179
Ginny, I failed to protect you three years ago.

11
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:34,179
Round your reputation and you couldn't go home.

12
00:00:34,179 --> 00:00:37,179
I'm no longer healthy anymore.

13
00:00:37,179 --> 00:00:44,179
And my greatest wish now is that you can marry a man that takes good care of you.

14
00:00:44,179 --> 00:00:47,179
Houston is the grandson of my bestie.

15
00:00:47,179 --> 00:00:50,179
He promised me to take good care of you.

16
00:00:50,179 --> 00:00:52,179
I'll marry him, Grandma.

17
00:00:52,179 --> 00:00:57,179
As long as it puts Grandma's worries to rest, does it matter who to marry?

18
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:07,019
We've got the license.

19
00:01:07,019 --> 00:01:11,019
I'm so happy for you, Ginny. Wish you two a happy life and have children soon.

20
00:01:11,019 --> 00:01:23,730
Guy ran away right after getting the license. What do you look like?

21
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:31,349
Mr. Mike, I heard the President Miller have been in Europe for a year for business and just got back today.

22
00:01:31,349 --> 00:01:35,349
Yes. So she just got transferred from the subsidiary to the headquarters.

23
00:01:35,349 --> 00:01:37,349
We have got a chance to be Mr. Miller.

24
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:48,769
Mr. President, Mr. Miller.
