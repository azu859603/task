1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,740
You've gone away, Mr. Miller. You're not having a thing for him, are you?

2
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:16,739
There was a girl from the secretary's office who attempted to hook up with Mr. Miller and was fired right away.

3
00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:17,739
I'm not.

4
00:00:17,739 --> 00:00:21,870
Ginny, where do you get the boss to leave your eyes on Mr. Miller?

5
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:26,870
Isn't that the weirdo who mess with you all the time after you've rejected his advances?

6
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:30,870
Right, you may not know. We're the nowadays. Like the punch above their weight.

7
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:36,869
The easy-on-the-eyes wines are all dreaming about marrying and the load of families.

8
00:00:37,869 --> 00:00:49,090
Ignore the douche pack. I've got big news. The president will pick one from over 20 people in the secretary's office to join me, as a special assistant.

9
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:55,979
You gotta seize the opportunity.

10
00:00:55,979 --> 00:00:56,979
Come in.

11
00:00:56,979 --> 00:01:04,900
Mr. Miller, the two best candidates from the secretary's office are here.

12
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:11,019
Mr. Miller, my name is David and I've been working in the president's office for five years.

13
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,180
By the way, my uncle Jamie asked me to pause all his greetings.

14
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:20,819
I hate those who exploit connections the most.

15
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:28,109
I still feel like I've seen him somewhere.

16
00:01:28,109 --> 00:01:31,420
What are you doing?

17
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:35,120
Hi, Mr. Miller. My name is Ginny and I...

18
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,120
Ginny?

19
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,569
Why does the name Ginny ring a bell?

20
00:01:39,569 --> 00:01:44,239
Let her stay here and be my personal secretary.

21
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:46,239
Personal secretary?
