00:00:02.319 --> 00:00:03.319
Alice.

2
00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:04.320
Grandmother?

3
00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.880
How can you be a husband like this, leaving your wife behind right after marrying her

4
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.480
last year and hustling in Europe for a year?

5
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:23.649
If you do not take her home, I will never leave this summer resort until my dying day.

6
00:00:23.649 --> 00:00:27.050
Grandma, I was planning to call for her today.

7
00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:37.210
Oh, I'll send you her address and number and you go pick her up yourself after work.

8
00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:43.130
I'm telling you, you have to make it up to her.

9
00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:44.130
Sure.

10
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.700
I will make up for what I owe this past year and be a good husband.

11
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:54.740
What do you think I should prepare before meeting a woman, depending on what woman?

12
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:55.740
My wife.

13
00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:01.740
So Mr. Miller is married and smiling so gently speaking of his wife, they must love each other

14
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:02.740
so much.

15
00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:07.739
Mr. Miller, the netless name's still there that you specifically want the parents to spend

16
00:01:07.739 --> 00:01:09.739
ten million dollars for.

17
00:01:09.739 --> 00:01:10.739
Is for your wife?

18
00:01:10.739 --> 00:01:11.739
Who else?
