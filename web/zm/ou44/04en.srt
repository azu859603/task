1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,179
With the $10 million dollar necklace in hand, you're already prepared.

2
00:00:05,179 --> 00:00:13,250
Mr. Miller, it takes a young girl to know the interest of young girls.

3
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:19,250
Mr. Miller, I think girls would adore jewelry for sure, but I think the little things like

4
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:24,250
getting your wife at bouquet, taking her out to dinner, catching a movie together, are priceless.

5
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:27,250
Good. You go arrange these.

6
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:34,039
Remember, Mr. Miller really hates loose subordinates who have a secret crush on them.

7
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:35,039
Don't ruin your own career.

8
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:39,039
Thanks for the heads up, Mike. I only fancy to double pay, not himself.

9
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:45,850
I'm finally done with the grind.

10
00:00:45,850 --> 00:01:08,469
These rich folks can do nothing without bossing others' room.

11
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:09,469
Who is it?

12
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:16,890
How can my own wife not even know my number?

13
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:17,890
Test him.

14
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:19,560
Who rings a bill?

15
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,390
Alokistan, is there anything I can help you?

16
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:29,700
My confused babe has even forgotten my name on the marriage license.

17
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:30,700
I'm your sweetie.

18
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,700
Come for dinner, if you are up.

19
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:38,420
How can there be another man's voice in my wife's house?

20
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:46,930
Turns out my so-called good wife is a slut.
