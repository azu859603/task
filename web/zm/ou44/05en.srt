1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,429
Hanged up like that, it's such a weirdo, but how do you know my private number?

2
00:00:07,429 --> 00:00:13,529
Come for dinner, Jeannie! Come for dinner, dinner's ready.

3
00:00:13,529 --> 00:00:18,510
This looks wonderful, thank you so much!

4
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:29,960
So President of the top-notch conglomerate, M Group, the top-notch conglomerate, has never shown his face in the public media.

5
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,179
How does he look? Are you charmed off your feet?

6
00:00:34,179 --> 00:00:42,179
He's got the looks for sure, but as far as it fits to the extent that Trump's feet off, that's for his wife to answer.

7
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:45,179
Oh, really? Oh, he's married!

8
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:51,340
And he loves his wife dearly. He does look familiar. I couldn't remember what I'd seen before.

9
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,340
Don't forget you married, lady.

10
00:00:53,340 --> 00:01:01,340
Do you really expect Jeannie to spend the rest of her life waiting for that bastard, who vanished right after marrying her?

11
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:11,700
That irresponsible jerk? I swear, even if he gets down and begs me, I won't lay eyes on him.

12
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:19,629
Mr. Miller seems to be really upset today. You think maybe he didn't get what he wanted from his wife last night?

13
00:01:19,629 --> 00:01:23,629
Is that something we can gossip about as subordinates?
