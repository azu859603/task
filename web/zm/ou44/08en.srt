00:00:11,339 --> 00:00:17,039
Um, Mr. Miller, I know that a last minute change to the partnering company will cause a great loss to Engroup.

2
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,739
I am really grateful for you for helping me out.

3
00:00:19,739 --> 00:00:23,940
It's the main fault of the man who sexually harassed you, not you.

4
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:28,620
When you are bullied in the workplace, no matter what the occasion is.

5
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:31,519
And you gotta fight back, bravely.

6
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,920
And there's no need to hold your tongue.

7
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,119
Engroup will always be supporting you.

8
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:45,439
If somebody stepped forward to defend me,

9
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:48,439
when I was pushing around back in the old days,

10
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:53,479
it wouldn't have gotten back rep.

11
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:58,679
Thank you, Mr. Miller. I know what to do going forward.

12
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:01,179
You weren't backing off when you pushed you around, you know.

13
00:01:01,179 --> 00:01:04,829
And look, now you are weeping.

14
00:01:04,829 --> 00:01:10,129
Um, Mr. Miller, I'm going to shop around for some local specialties before we leave.

15
00:01:10,129 --> 00:01:11,829
Do you want to bring your wife a gift?

16
00:01:11,829 --> 00:01:14,030
Last time I heard a man's voice here with a phone call there.

17
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:15,430
Of course, it doesn't prove anything.

18
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:17,629
It might be just a misunderstanding.

19
00:01:17,629 --> 00:01:20,629
Okay, I'll go with you. I'm taking my wife to dinner tonight.

20
00:01:20,629 --> 00:01:22,629
You booked the restaurant ready, okay?

21
00:01:22,629 --> 00:01:25,629
Yeah, no problem. Leave it to me, Mr. Miller.
