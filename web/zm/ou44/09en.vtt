00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:07.530
A diamond bracelet costs ten million dollars, three purses, for more than four million.

2
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:11.730
The decadence of the rich is truly beyond my wildest imagination.

3
00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:21.859
Mr. Thomas of YU Corporation, who had been investigated for corruption, was involved in a car accident while escaping,

4
00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:23.859
and his right hand was permanently disabled.

5
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.100
Hey, if Mrs. White doesn't know how to play, I can teach you!

6
00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:35.229
What is it?

7
00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:39.729
Um, Mr. Miller, Mr. Thomas of YU Company had an accident, did you?

8
00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:42.229
You should be glad to have lost only one hand.

9
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.270
The word has it that Mr. Miller is restless and cruel.

10
00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.130
What? Scared?

11
00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:54.130
No, I'm not.

12
00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:56.159
Are you sure?

13
00:00:56.159 --> 00:01:05.920
It doesn't matter what the rumors say about Mr. Miller, being ruthless or what.

14
00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.420
That Mr. Miller I know smiles softly when speaking of his wife,

15
00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:16.450
and prefers gifts, no matter how busy he's at work, any defenses, board units,

16
00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.120
and I'm a resistant and not your enemy. Why should I be afraid of you?

17
00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:27.760
Do you think I'm promiscuous or a man within your reach?

18
00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.260
I just want to add you as friend on WeChat's app.

19
00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:35.599
Beat it.

20
00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:45.310
A woman she has to make Mr. Miller diss faithful.
