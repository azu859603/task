00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:06,049
Mr. Miller, their bracelet is in the bouquet, and I have arranged a restaurant as well as the after-dinner entertainment.

2
00:00:06,049 --> 00:00:07,549
The details are sent to your phone.

3
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:09,050
Have a nice date.

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:18,030
Whoever the president's wife is, she's darn happy.

5
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:22,129
Finally, to call it a day.

6
00:00:22,129 --> 00:00:23,129
Hi, Grandma.

7
00:00:23,129 --> 00:00:34,130
Alice, do you have any idea that ever since you finished the paperwork and jet it off for work abroad, leaving your newlywed wife behind?

8
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:39,130
I haven't had the nerve to face her for this whole year.

9
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:47,179
You'd be driving me crazy if you don't go now to pick up Ginny and bring her home.

10
00:00:47,179 --> 00:00:50,310
Grandma, what did you say your name is?

11
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:53,439
Oh, oh my goodness.

12
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:55,439
What am I going to do with you?

13
00:00:55,439 --> 00:01:00,920
Ginny, her name is Ginny.

14
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:05,590
All right. You don't even remember what your wife's name is.

15
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:07,590
I can take no more of you.

16
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:10,590
Hi, Mr. Miller. My name is Ginny.
