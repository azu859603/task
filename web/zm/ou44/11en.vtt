1
00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.860
No wonder rings a bell. It's the same name as my wife.

2
00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:08.609
Grandma, I was just about to go pick her up.

3
00:00:08.609 --> 00:00:11.609
When I get her, I will bring her to you first.

4
00:00:11.609 --> 00:00:13.810
Keep your word this time.

5
00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:16.989
Don't come.

6
00:00:16.989 --> 00:00:18.390
I tell you what.

7
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.179
Keep your butt to have married her.

8
00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:26.780
Be grateful for what you have.

9
00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:30.359
Grandma, I trust your good read of people.

10
00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.500
I want to share what will be responsible for her.

11
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:39.350
Mr. Miller, it's here. You want me to call for Mrs. Or...

12
00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.770
She's my wife. Of course I'll call myself.

13
00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:50.859
My dear, I hope you'll enjoy the gift I've prepared for you.

14
00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:51.859
Come on, come on, come on.

15
00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:54.859
Shake a like and fetch a bottle, catch up. The fried fish is almost done.

16
00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:56.859
Okay, I'm on my way.

17
00:00:56.859 --> 00:01:46.659
You're looking for her?

18
00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:50.390
Junior lives here?

19
00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:51.620
Yeah.

20
00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.379
And what is your relationship with her?

21
00:01:55.379 --> 00:01:57.859
Honey, who is it?

22
00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:03.099
Who are you? Who are you looking for?

23
00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:08.099
This is a woman that I married. Not only is she fooling around with another man, but she also doesn't recognize me.

24
00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.569
What is your relationship?

25
00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:15.139
How are the things between us having anything to do with you?

26
00:02:15.139 --> 00:02:20.139
I'm warning you, don't you ever bother us again, or I'll make you suffer.

27
00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:26.909
Come on, my Superman.

28
00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:32.909
All right, sugar, let me fill in the place left by the cheap husband of yours.

29
00:02:32.909 --> 00:03:02.150
Mm-hmm. That looks like Mr. Miller.

30
00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.629
And the flowers look familiar, too.

31
00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:10.629
God, you're okay.

32
00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:13.629
Come back home quickly. Go, go, go, go.

33
00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:21.610
Ugh. Must be another rejected word. What a waste.

34
00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.919
There seems to be something...

35
00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:29.330
Jeweled necklace.

36
00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:42.050
Guys, what are you doing?

37
00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:45.139
Did you see weird guy?

38
00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:48.610
What's wrong?

39
00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.090
There was a man knocking on our door.

40
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.090
She should know something evil because I answered honestly to every question he asked.

41
00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:01.090
Yeah, yeah. The man looked at me like he was trying to swallow me alive, scared the shit out of me.

42
00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.090
Luckily, Jason came around quickly.

43
00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.439
This neighbor has a large micro population.

44
00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:09.439
I heard about a robbery and murder case a few days ago.

45
00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:11.439
We had to stay vigilant from now on.

46
00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:14.439
I'll order a surveillance camera to be installed at the doorway.

47
00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:17.439
From today, onward, if you're late from work.

48
00:04:17.439 --> 00:04:20.439
Give me a call in advance and I'll pick you up downstairs, okay?

49
00:04:20.439 --> 00:04:25.160
Yeah. It's this shit.

50
00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:38.300
Forget it. I must have misread it.

51
00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.850
How could the bouquet I bought from Mr. Miller appear on my doorstep?

52
00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:50.399
Alice.

53
00:04:50.399 --> 00:04:51.399
Grandma.

54
00:04:51.399 --> 00:04:53.399
Where's Jenny?

55
00:04:53.399 --> 00:04:55.779
Jenny?

56
00:04:55.779 --> 00:05:00.149
What are you doing here without her?

57
00:05:00.149 --> 00:05:09.329
Yeah. She's with another man.

58
00:05:09.329 --> 00:05:10.329
What?

59
00:05:10.329 --> 00:05:13.420
What are you talking about?

60
00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:17.420
Jenny is not that kind of person. She would never do things like that.

61
00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:20.420
You ought not to tarnish her reputation.

62
00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:27.209
I saw it with my own eyes. What do you say?

63
00:05:27.209 --> 00:05:35.139
Alice, is there some kind of misunderstanding?

64
00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:38.139
Do you want grandma to call and ask?

65
00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:43.139
I called her when I came back from abroad and I just heard a man's voice on the phone.

66
00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:47.370
And I just lied to myself that it could be some misunderstanding.

67
00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:50.370
And today I went out to pick up some flowers for her.

68
00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.370
I saw her with another man.

69
00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.649
What are you going to do now?

70
00:05:55.649 --> 00:05:58.610
Divorce.

71
00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:03.819
Alice, I know you're seeing red now.

72
00:06:03.819 --> 00:06:05.819
But put yourself in Jenny's shoes.

73
00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:08.819
Girl Flush marries a guy she only met once.

74
00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:11.819
And her husband disappears right after they got the license.

75
00:06:11.819 --> 00:06:15.819
And there's nothing romantic between her and her Flush married husband.

76
00:06:15.819 --> 00:06:19.819
There's nothing wrong with meeting the right person during this time.

77
00:06:19.819 --> 00:06:20.819
So?

78
00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:24.069
Why don't we wait for her to file for divorce?

79
00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:29.420
That way we can both try and maintain some decency.

80
00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:31.740
What do you think?

81
00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:32.740
Decency?

82
00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:33.870
Grandma.

83
00:06:34.899 --> 00:06:38.899
If it wasn't for you, I'd have made this filthy couple disappear from New York City.

84
00:06:38.899 --> 00:06:41.899
And now you want me to give them decency?

85
00:06:41.899 --> 00:06:48.129
And does she ever think about my decency when she's having sex with another man?

86
00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:53.879
So I completely, I cannot.

87
00:06:53.879 --> 00:06:57.879
Please, prepare my divorce papers immediately.

88
00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:05.079
Alice, seems like I made a mistake.

89
00:07:05.079 --> 00:07:09.459
Alice, I just don't want your marriage to end up being the exchange.

90
00:07:10.459 --> 00:07:13.459
Like your parents.

91
00:07:13.459 --> 00:07:35.980
Hello Mr. Miller?

92
00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:40.519
Mrs. Alice's friend Ken, your president is drunk.

93
00:07:40.519 --> 00:07:43.519
Come to me use and get him back.

94
00:07:43.519 --> 00:07:49.949
Mr. Middle of the night, Mr. Miller should be with his wife.

95
00:07:49.949 --> 00:07:51.949
How is he drunk at the club?

96
00:07:51.949 --> 00:07:56.810
Never mind getting a drunk and president at home.

97
00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:58.810
This was in the duties of a personal secretary.

98
00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:06.860
I'm here to think of Mr. Miller.

99
00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:20.810
You're Alice's new assistant?

100
00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:26.259
It's a shame for such a hot shake to hang around this summer.

101
00:08:26.259 --> 00:08:30.670
They say on the internet that this kid is a playboy.

102
00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:31.670
They eat.

103
00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:35.399
It's white.

104
00:08:35.399 --> 00:08:37.460
Do you have a boyfriend?

105
00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:41.899
It's my personal business.

106
00:08:41.899 --> 00:08:44.149
They're not.

107
00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:46.250
I can be your boyfriend.

108
00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:49.409
Sorry, I'm not interested in Mr. Smith.

109
00:08:49.409 --> 00:08:50.409
Mmm.

110
00:08:50.409 --> 00:08:51.409
Not interested in me?

111
00:08:51.409 --> 00:08:53.409
Are you interested in...

112
00:08:53.409 --> 00:08:55.049
Alice then?

113
00:09:01.549 --> 00:09:05.120
I guessed it, right?

114
00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:11.830
Mr. Smith, is it this hard to learn to be respectful?

115
00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:16.830
You're so full of yourself to think that all the women would fall for a rich guy like you.

116
00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:19.539
Whoa.

117
00:09:19.539 --> 00:09:21.919
Interesting.

118
00:09:21.919 --> 00:09:25.720
Alice, your new assistant's got a lot of nerve.

119
00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:26.720
Who's back at her?

120
00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:29.259
Me?

121
00:09:29.259 --> 00:09:30.259
Why?

122
00:09:30.259 --> 00:09:32.259
Okay, okay, fine.

123
00:09:32.259 --> 00:09:35.960
Mr. Miller, you want to go home?

124
00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:46.179
Yes, let's go.

125
00:09:46.179 --> 00:09:53.220
Miss White, if you're looking for a guy, look for somebody as good looking as handy as I am.

126
00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:55.220
Not somebody like you, Mr. Miller.

127
00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:59.220
He's only got a pretty face, but not good and bad.

128
00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:23.019
Mr. Miller, are you having a fever?

129
00:10:23.019 --> 00:10:25.019
Why are you so warm and turning red?

130
00:10:25.019 --> 00:10:28.080
It doesn't look like just being drunk.

131
00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:32.519
Are you allergic to alcohol?

132
00:10:32.519 --> 00:10:34.519
Mr. Miller, wait a moment.

133
00:10:34.519 --> 00:11:04.899
Ginny?

134
00:11:04.899 --> 00:11:07.409
Are you sober now, Mr. Miller?

135
00:11:07.409 --> 00:11:09.700
Why did you get this awful name?

136
00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:12.559
I got my name from my grandma.

137
00:11:12.559 --> 00:11:16.100
I saw this out at night when nonsense has been uttering.

138
00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:19.549
Mr. Miller, you'd better rest.

139
00:11:19.549 --> 00:11:34.929
You couldn't speak.

140
00:11:34.929 --> 00:11:51.259
Mr. Miller, water is here.

141
00:11:51.259 --> 00:11:54.259
Mr. Miller, if you're okay, I'll leave.

142
00:11:54.259 --> 00:12:05.480
Must be his wife.

143
00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:08.480
Me and Mr. Miller are in the same room in the middle of the night.

144
00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:26.259
What's going on?

145
00:12:26.259 --> 00:12:30.360
What's going on?

146
00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:32.360
Mr. Miller, should I hide somewhere?

147
00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:33.360
What are you hiding from?

148
00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:36.679
It would be bad if your wife misunderstood.

149
00:12:36.679 --> 00:12:38.129
Don't worry.

150
00:12:38.129 --> 00:12:42.129
She won't misunderstand, and I'm not interested in you either.

151
00:12:42.129 --> 00:12:43.159
Fine.

152
00:12:43.159 --> 00:12:47.159
If you have nothing to worry about me neither, whatever.

153
00:12:47.159 --> 00:12:57.139
Alice, you knew you are a allergic tool.

154
00:12:57.139 --> 00:13:05.139
If she dares tell anyone about my weakness, I'll have to tell Bruce to throw her into the New York City River and feed her to the fish.

155
00:13:05.139 --> 00:13:09.139
I've been working my butt off all night, and instead of thanking me,

156
00:13:09.139 --> 00:13:12.139
you're going to feed me to the fish?

157
00:13:12.139 --> 00:13:15.139
You know you can't drink any alcohol.

158
00:13:15.139 --> 00:13:18.139
Why you still did it? You are risking your own life.

159
00:13:18.139 --> 00:13:20.139
I was feeling down, so I had a few drinks.

160
00:13:20.139 --> 00:13:24.059
Why were you feeling down?

161
00:13:24.059 --> 00:13:33.750
Mrs. White, please come over and give me a hand.

162
00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:38.750
Alice, take off your clothes, and let Miss White help apply the medicine.

163
00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:44.539
No, I'm fine now, and I don't need any ointment.

164
00:13:44.539 --> 00:13:50.820
If you don't cooperate, I'll have to call your grandma.

165
00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:54.820
Mr. Miller, you better listen to Dr. Mary.

166
00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:59.019
Felix, come here.

167
00:13:59.019 --> 00:14:02.019
Alice, Felix hurt his hand and has not healed.

168
00:14:02.019 --> 00:14:04.019
Better than Miss White do it.

169
00:14:04.019 --> 00:14:12.139
I'm going to do this for you. If it wasn't for the double salary, I wouldn't do it even if you bit me.

170
00:14:12.139 --> 00:14:15.139
Mr. Miller, bear with me, please. I will try not to hurt you.

171
00:14:15.139 --> 00:14:25.580
I'll do it myself.

172
00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:28.580
Mr. Miller, did I hurt you?

173
00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:30.580
Felix, take her home.

174
00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:42.600
I want to do it for you.

175
00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:44.659
Mr. Miller?

176
00:14:44.659 --> 00:14:56.110
What did you do to have mess with Mr. Miller?

177
00:14:56.110 --> 00:15:03.669
Could it be the wife of the president found out that I took Mr. Miller back home the other day,

178
00:15:03.669 --> 00:15:05.669
and she misunderstood it?

179
00:15:05.669 --> 00:15:07.669
Mr. Miller gave me that cold walk.

180
00:15:07.669 --> 00:15:19.220
Looks like I can't have any contact with Mr. Miller, except for West.

181
00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:24.350
So, failed in your attempt to seduce Mr. Miller with your look?

182
00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:28.769
Can I expect anything other than a grunt for me, David?

183
00:15:28.769 --> 00:15:33.769
You're so good at cursing without sinking into foul language.

184
00:15:33.769 --> 00:15:37.799
Impressive, but we've got a long way forward.

185
00:15:37.799 --> 00:15:40.799
And let's see who gets to come out on top, and...

186
00:15:40.799 --> 00:15:52.080
Yeah, well see you.

187
00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:58.580
You asked for us ready, and can compensate you $10 million for moral damages.

188
00:15:58.580 --> 00:15:59.580
Good.

189
00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:02.580
Those who have the guts to betray me will have to suffer the consequences.

190
00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:04.779
You contact that woman tomorrow.

191
00:16:04.779 --> 00:16:07.929
And ask her to initiate the divorce.

192
00:16:07.929 --> 00:16:11.929
I promised grandma I'd wait for the other party to file for divorce,

193
00:16:11.929 --> 00:16:19.559
but I didn't say to hold my lawyer back from spurring her on.

194
00:16:19.559 --> 00:16:21.559
Mr. Miller, you asked for me?

195
00:16:21.559 --> 00:16:22.559
You're coming with me.

196
00:16:22.559 --> 00:16:26.870
To the Smith family banquet tonight.

197
00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:28.870
You're not mad at me anymore?

198
00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:31.539
I'm the one who took it out on her.

199
00:16:31.539 --> 00:16:34.539
She just happened to share the name of that despicable woman, Miss White.

200
00:16:34.539 --> 00:16:51.399
Miss White? May I ask you for a dance?

201
00:16:51.399 --> 00:16:56.580
Mr. Smith, I'm sorry, I don't know how to dance.

202
00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:58.580
I can teach you.

203
00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:02.639
Didn't Mr. Smith ask me if I had a boyfriend last time?

204
00:17:02.639 --> 00:17:06.059
You're going to turn me down by pretending to have a boyfriend.

205
00:17:06.059 --> 00:17:08.059
I don't have a boyfriend.

206
00:17:08.059 --> 00:17:11.140
Then I can court you.

207
00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:14.329
I have a husband.

208
00:17:14.329 --> 00:17:25.019
It's the first time I've ever met a woman rejecting me with such a creative excuse.

209
00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:30.220
Mr. Smith, I'm really not interested you at all. Not now, not ever.

210
00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:35.859
Don't waste your time on me.

211
00:17:35.859 --> 00:17:37.859
Well, well.

212
00:17:37.859 --> 00:17:42.859
Instead of entertaining the guests as the host, you're hiding here, flirting with my assistant.

213
00:17:42.859 --> 00:17:45.859
How much of what Ken and I said to you here?

214
00:17:45.859 --> 00:17:50.809
Mr. Miller.

215
00:17:50.809 --> 00:17:54.809
Alice, your assistant is bullying me around all the time.

216
00:17:54.809 --> 00:17:56.970
Teach her some discipline.

217
00:17:56.970 --> 00:18:00.220
Are you bullying him?

218
00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:04.500
No way. How dare I pick on Mr. Smith's in his territory.

219
00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:09.789
Alice, you changed. You're placing women above friends now.

220
00:18:09.789 --> 00:18:10.789
Stop your nonsense.

221
00:18:10.789 --> 00:18:14.750
Okay. Okay. So?

222
00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:16.750
Let's get a drink then.

223
00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:18.779
Mr. Miller, you can't drink tonight.

224
00:18:18.779 --> 00:18:21.779
Dr. Mary called me and said you can't drink any alcohol.

225
00:18:21.779 --> 00:18:25.779
Alice, your assistant is bossy like your wife.

226
00:18:25.779 --> 00:18:28.779
Mr. Smith, could you hold your tongue for a minute?

227
00:18:28.779 --> 00:18:30.880
Alice, look. She's bullying me again.

228
00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:33.880
Well, I'm not in the mood for any drink tonight.

229
00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:37.829
Let's go for something else.

230
00:18:37.829 --> 00:18:40.829
Hey. So? Let's play Truth or Dare tonight.

231
00:18:40.829 --> 00:18:42.829
See you, Alice. Here.

232
00:18:42.829 --> 00:18:45.119
There's the guts.

233
00:18:45.119 --> 00:18:48.119
I'm game for anything that doesn't give up money.

234
00:18:48.119 --> 00:19:07.819
Okay, then. Truth or dare? It is.

235
00:19:07.819 --> 00:19:11.910
You lost. Truth or dare?

236
00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:13.900
Truth?

237
00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:22.950
Um, the excuse you used tonight when you turned me down is a truth or a made-up excuse.

238
00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:27.460
I don't have a boyfriend.

239
00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:28.460
So I can court you?

240
00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:37.430
I have a husband.

241
00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:45.619
The excuse you used tonight when you turned me down is a truth or a made-up excuse.

242
00:19:45.619 --> 00:19:48.539
It's true.

243
00:19:48.539 --> 00:19:50.539
I miss white between you and Mr. Smith.

244
00:19:50.539 --> 00:19:54.089
You've already asked one question. Ask a kid after you win the next hand.

245
00:19:54.089 --> 00:20:07.619
Okay. You lost. Truth or dare?

246
00:20:07.619 --> 00:20:09.740
Truth?

247
00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:14.940
Jenny, it's your turn to ask.

248
00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:16.940
Why are you always making fun of me?

249
00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:21.349
Because, Jenny, you're so cute.

250
00:20:21.349 --> 00:20:25.589
I can't help it.

251
00:20:25.589 --> 00:20:27.589
Why don't you tell Alice and come work for me?

252
00:20:27.589 --> 00:20:30.690
Where do you get the balls to snatch my people?

253
00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:33.839
Next hand, next hand.

254
00:20:33.839 --> 00:20:50.710
Again.

255
00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:54.710
The paparazzi says that you're dating that super hot Jennifer. Is that true?

256
00:20:54.710 --> 00:21:00.859
I just got out of her bed this morning. What do you think?

257
00:21:00.859 --> 00:21:01.859
Ooh.

258
00:21:01.859 --> 00:21:04.109
The gossip gets her carried away.

259
00:21:04.109 --> 00:21:13.589
Next hand, Alice's winning streak can't go forever and beat me every hand.

260
00:21:13.589 --> 00:21:23.759
No one can beat me if I don't want to lose.

261
00:21:23.759 --> 00:21:27.690
This man is not a man. What a god.

262
00:21:27.690 --> 00:21:36.150
I don't care Alice.

263
00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:40.150
You're gonna answer a question even if you win to amend my little heartburn by you.

264
00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:46.769
What's going on with you and your wife?

265
00:21:46.769 --> 00:21:48.769
What's going on with you and your wife?

266
00:21:48.769 --> 00:21:59.059
It's so curious as to what happened.

267
00:21:59.059 --> 00:22:04.819
Let's go. That's it? Yes. You guys have ruined the fun.

268
00:22:04.819 --> 00:22:12.170
What else do you have fun in besides work?

269
00:22:12.170 --> 00:22:16.170
Mr. Miller, what are those many people flocked over to make a toast?

270
00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:25.569
I almost got hammered. I have drunk that much for you and you're calling me a fool how unfair.

271
00:22:25.569 --> 00:22:28.569
You think just anyone is qualified to drink with me?

272
00:22:28.569 --> 00:22:33.140
No one will force me to drink if I don't want to.

273
00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:38.490
Mr. Miller, why did you say that earlier? That's what I didn't have to drink that much.

274
00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:41.490
You're being foolish and you have the nerve to blame me now?

275
00:22:41.490 --> 00:22:49.450
Where's your place? Tell Bruce to drive you back.

276
00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:55.180
No need thanks Mr. Miller. I've got somebody to pick me up.

277
00:22:55.180 --> 00:23:00.799
Your husband? Your husband?

278
00:23:00.799 --> 00:23:04.799
Oh no, it's where my husband has been fooling around. There's no way for him to come for me.

279
00:23:04.799 --> 00:23:07.799
Take care of this stuff and my trunk for me, okay?

280
00:23:07.799 --> 00:23:23.730
Yes sir. Mr. Miller, aren't these gifts for your wife? What have you given them out?

281
00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:31.140
They have no use now. So throw them away, sell them or use them yourself. What have you wanted to do with them?

282
00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:33.140
Mr. Miller, what happened to you and your wife?

283
00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:35.140
You're again in front of me.

284
00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:37.849
Mr. Miller, Dr. de Villa.

285
00:23:37.849 --> 00:23:43.579
Later. Hasn't the guy coming to pick you up arrived yet?

286
00:23:43.579 --> 00:23:51.630
Traffic is bad around here today and he's been stuck in it for a while. He's coming.

287
00:23:51.630 --> 00:24:13.630
Oh my guy's here. Bye Mr. Miller. Jason, I'm here.

288
00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:17.079
Mr. Miller, Ms. Whitener, husband are so sweet.

289
00:24:17.079 --> 00:24:18.079
Drive.

290
00:24:18.079 --> 00:24:32.410
You're such a silly little girl. Are you really going to put yourself through all that trouble to get a double paycheck?

291
00:24:32.410 --> 00:24:38.569
They're bullied if you have money.

292
00:24:38.569 --> 00:24:43.980
Ginny, it's been three years. It's all over.

293
00:24:43.980 --> 00:25:00.230
Really weak to alcohol. Crying up every time.

294
00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:07.460
It's okay, it's fine. You can cry all you want to. There's news. I really need to share to you.

295
00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:14.460
Guess what? Your novel has received really good reception and SH pictures wanted by the movie and TV rights.

296
00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:15.460
Really?

297
00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:26.160
Yeah, they asked to meet us this weekend. They sounded very sincere and you'll get a ticket to go to DC on Friday, okay?

298
00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:27.160
Yeah?

299
00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:36.279
By the way, this looks very expensive. You didn't even tell us. You made a fortune. Look at you.

300
00:25:36.279 --> 00:25:44.410
These are the gifts my boss bought. I think they had a fight or something, so he asked me to deal with them.

301
00:25:44.410 --> 00:26:24.950
Oh Ginny, I'm sorry I didn't see you. Did it burn you?

302
00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:38.769
How's it taste to be in the brink of disaster? I want to fuck you up.

303
00:26:38.769 --> 00:26:43.619
I want to fuck you up.

304
00:26:43.619 --> 00:26:46.519
Fuck off you bastard!

305
00:26:46.519 --> 00:26:51.519
Ginny, I warned you long ago not to compete with me for the position of special assistance to the President.

306
00:26:51.519 --> 00:26:58.900
Yes, you don't listen. I would just have to let you get out of angry and the most shameful amount of money.

307
00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:00.900
This is who you will...

308
00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:08.980
Ginny looks pure and innocent, but her private life turns out to be this messy.

309
00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:15.039
Who knows how many men she's slept with. Maybe she hooked up with some guy to get the chance to be transferred to HQ.

310
00:27:15.039 --> 00:27:20.039
It's the least of her and a girl who's trying to get ahead, but it's kind of pretty.

311
00:27:20.039 --> 00:27:27.650
Just make up rumors about her private life and accuse her of seducing men, and then everyone will come to believe in abuse.

312
00:27:27.650 --> 00:27:31.650
Look at that piece of yours, what a vamp messing around with married men at this young age bitch.

313
00:27:31.650 --> 00:27:34.059
Keep making it up.

314
00:27:34.059 --> 00:27:37.059
Stop trying to shit the blimp. Get her out. Pour away from here. Never come back.

315
00:27:37.059 --> 00:27:49.599
The whites did not have a place for a shameful someone like you.

316
00:27:49.599 --> 00:27:52.660
Your father would turn over in his grave knowing that it ultimately you committed.

317
00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:54.660
Get out of here!

318
00:27:54.660 --> 00:28:02.230
Just like what happened to me three years ago.

319
00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:07.750
Ginny, is any of this true?

320
00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:12.730
Ginny, is any of this true?

321
00:28:13.730 --> 00:28:15.730
Is Mr. Miller here yet?

322
00:28:15.730 --> 00:28:16.730
Just arrived.

323
00:28:16.730 --> 00:28:24.150
Mr. Miller, there are rumors in a company that I have been sleeping around in private.

324
00:28:24.150 --> 00:28:26.150
Can I buy you for two minutes to explain?

325
00:28:26.150 --> 00:28:34.539
I'm not interested in your private life, but if there's a possibility that M Group's image could be tarnished by your fairs, then I'm sorry.

326
00:28:34.539 --> 00:28:36.700
M Group cannot keep you.

327
00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:39.730
But, Mr. Miller, please let me explain before.

328
00:28:39.730 --> 00:28:48.529
You say it's a rumor, then show me the rebuttal evidence.

329
00:28:48.529 --> 00:28:51.529
I'll give you two hours to get it right.

330
00:28:51.529 --> 00:28:54.529
Or how do you expect me to trust your abilities?

331
00:28:54.529 --> 00:29:00.980
Thank you, Mr. Miller.

332
00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:07.299
Mr. Miller, you asked for me?

333
00:29:07.299 --> 00:29:10.299
Have the tech department fully back up Ginny.

334
00:29:10.299 --> 00:29:11.299
Okay.

335
00:29:11.299 --> 00:29:17.089
Since one has such trivial things start to concern, Mr. Miller.

336
00:29:17.089 --> 00:29:32.930
The evidence is all gathered. I know David was behind us.

337
00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:33.930
What are you doing?

338
00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:37.930
Do you know who my uncle is? Let me go. I'll make you all fly us.

339
00:29:37.930 --> 00:29:46.920
Men know any means other than making up rumors to slow shaming a woman?

340
00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:48.920
Shini, I'm not talking with you.

341
00:29:50.269 --> 00:29:59.250
HR department?

342
00:29:59.250 --> 00:30:06.250
Notify everyone in the company that anyone who conspires to slander coworkers will be blacklisted permanently by M Group.

343
00:30:06.250 --> 00:30:10.869
You've all seen what happened today.

344
00:30:10.869 --> 00:30:16.869
If I can get David, the rumor monger out of your family, I can get any other crooks to go as well.

345
00:30:16.869 --> 00:30:21.869
Because, behind me, stands Mr. Miller.

346
00:30:21.869 --> 00:30:22.869
Mr. Miller.

347
00:30:22.869 --> 00:30:41.569
Thank you.

348
00:30:41.569 --> 00:30:42.569
Thank me for what?

349
00:30:42.569 --> 00:30:47.569
I know you called the tech department, otherwise I would have no way to track down the IP address David used.

350
00:30:47.569 --> 00:30:50.569
Mr. Miller made me make that call. Thank him if you want.

351
00:30:50.569 --> 00:30:58.339
I thought it was Mr. Miller who suspected me enough sleeping around.

352
00:30:58.339 --> 00:31:00.339
So he said those cruel words.

353
00:31:00.339 --> 00:31:04.339
I never thought it was for me to turn up evidence to prove my innocence.

354
00:31:04.339 --> 00:31:11.339
Only Grandma, Jason, and Maggie trusted me unconditionally, but Mr. Miller believed me as much as those closest to me.

355
00:31:11.339 --> 00:31:13.339
I'll work hard and stay loyal.

356
00:31:13.339 --> 00:31:15.339
Sure up, I believe in you.

357
00:31:15.339 --> 00:31:25.809
Mr. Miller is as pleasant to die as the world's famous paintings.

358
00:31:25.809 --> 00:31:27.900
What are you looking at?

359
00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:29.900
I think Mr. Miller, you're the best boss in the world.

360
00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:34.700
I think Mr. Miller, you're the best boss in the world.

361
00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:38.019
Mr. Miller doesn't like the ass kissing thing.

362
00:31:40.359 --> 00:31:46.359
In terms of varying, no one compares to Mr. Miller who remains so elegant and reserved, even when eating.

363
00:31:46.359 --> 00:31:50.359
What? Mr. Miller is simply stunning. His features are so...

364
00:31:50.359 --> 00:31:51.359
So what?

365
00:31:51.359 --> 00:31:57.339
So... so thankful to you.

366
00:31:57.339 --> 00:32:02.079
Then work harder. Attend to the file after you finish your meal.

367
00:32:02.079 --> 00:32:03.079
Yes, sir.

368
00:32:03.079 --> 00:32:22.619
I was not doing you a favor, but the way you handled it and the efficiency today showed me your value.

369
00:32:22.619 --> 00:32:26.619
Dr. Miller will be here later. Go ask her for some medicine yourself.

370
00:32:26.619 --> 00:32:37.000
Mix these topicals and apply twice a day. It will itch a little bit when the skin peels off.

371
00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:42.490
Just don't scratch it.

372
00:32:42.490 --> 00:32:50.309
Dr. Mary, thank you.

373
00:32:50.309 --> 00:32:55.910
Mr. Miller, your wife is not answering the phone.

374
00:32:55.910 --> 00:33:01.230
No one answers the phone. Can't you go knock on her door?

375
00:33:01.230 --> 00:33:03.230
Most loyal was Mr. Miller.

376
00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:10.269
Do I have to teach you how to find people myself?

377
00:33:10.269 --> 00:33:12.269
Go grind me a cup of coffee.

378
00:33:12.269 --> 00:33:13.849
Yes, sir.

379
00:33:13.849 --> 00:33:16.849
Even the lawyers can't get hold of that unfaithful woman.

380
00:33:16.849 --> 00:33:29.299
Then there's no way to cut ties with her right away.

381
00:33:29.299 --> 00:33:30.299
Piece of shit!

382
00:33:30.299 --> 00:33:35.109
Would I go down this much?

383
00:33:35.109 --> 00:33:38.109
The lawyer said that he failed to find that woman at her own place.

384
00:33:38.109 --> 00:33:41.109
What the hell is she up to? Did she fancy me coming to her in person?

385
00:33:41.109 --> 00:33:45.619
This is Kesta. The man you married a year ago.

386
00:33:45.619 --> 00:33:51.849
Come out and meet me right away to discuss her divorce.

387
00:33:51.849 --> 00:33:53.849
How is her cell beeping?
