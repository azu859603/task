00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:05.370
I'm toast, and I prefer to move on on me, and it just happened to be right now.

2
00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:07.370
This is Kesta.

3
00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.369
The man you married a year ago, come out and meet me right away to discuss her divorce.

4
00:00:11.369 --> 00:00:15.939
Hello? Mr. Miller, I'm sorry.

5
00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:17.940
You two can finish today.

6
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.059
Yes, sir.

7
00:00:19.059 --> 00:00:22.059
Yes, sir. Holy crap, gonna miss the flight.

8
00:00:22.059 --> 00:00:28.910
Sorry, guys. I'm sorry. I've been working extra hours.

9
00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.909
Why do you work overtime every day? Is your boss running a sweatshop?

10
00:00:32.909 --> 00:00:36.909
No bad works, my boss. He's the best boss in the world.

11
00:00:36.909 --> 00:00:39.909
Oh, Ginny, you've suddenly become so defensive for him.

12
00:00:39.909 --> 00:00:43.619
Is there something going on between you two?

13
00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:44.619
What are you doing?

14
00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:47.679
To find out if you smell of men.

15
00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:51.679
No smell of men, only medications.

16
00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:53.679
What's with the burns? Who did this to you?

17
00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:55.679
What's sort of a bitch to this to you? I'll finish him.

18
00:00:55.679 --> 00:00:58.679
Save it, you guys. I've already sent him to prison.

19
00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:06.730
This is Kesta.

20
00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.730
The man you married a year ago, come out and meet me right away to discuss her divorce.
