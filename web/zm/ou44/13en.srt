1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:03,240
Why are you? Why don't you answer my message?

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:09,240
The man that disappeared after I married him was heard from Loughan that year later, looking for divorce.

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,439
And on the same day I was slender?

4
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:20,620
Ginny, is this happening to Ginny again, like three years ago?

5
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:23,820
How could you give it to those bastards?

6
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,320
It was that scumbag who tried to rape you.

7
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:32,320
And now since you've agreed to come with terms with them, everyone would assume that you seduced him.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,500
Don't pressure Ginny.

9
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,200
They outnumber at her and have made a scene of the school.

10
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,000
Ginny almost got expelled. What could she do?

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,500
You're right.

12
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,130
Ginny, I'm sorry.

13
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:52,289
I'm just very touched by the fact that you and Jason were the only ones besides Grandma.

14
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:54,789
I've always trusted me when it happens.

15
00:00:54,789 --> 00:01:00,289
Ginny, you still have your boyfriend. He has faith in you as well and he's coming to pick you up.

16
00:01:00,289 --> 00:01:04,790
Yeah. And he loves you so much and his family is so well off.

17
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:07,790
He might even figure out a way to help you Ginny.

18
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:16,129
I'm here.

19
00:01:16,129 --> 00:01:20,129
Ginny, I know all of your shitty things. We're done.
