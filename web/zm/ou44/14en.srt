1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,899
The Panos is a prestigious family in MC City.

2
00:00:02,899 --> 00:00:04,580
We can't afford to take this shit.

3
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:07,219
If we meet again, please pretend you don't know.

4
00:00:08,769 --> 00:00:09,570
Okay.

5
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,130
Burn and help, you asshole!

6
00:00:16,609 --> 00:00:18,750
Jenny couldn't sleep well for a long time afterwards,

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,429
and was always woken up by nightmares in the middle of the night.

8
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:25,429
And Jenny's comeback, X, went at Europe to study,

9
00:00:25,429 --> 00:00:26,870
and was never heard from again.

10
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:30,929
Jenny stopped believing in love since then.

11
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:36,560
That's why she promised her grandmother to marry a stranger.

12
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,859
Is Jenny running into another scumbag like three years ago?

13
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,500
I don't have time for a divorce today.

14
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,100
8 p.m. Monday night, you decide to place.

15
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:53,609
This woman is finally willing to come out.
