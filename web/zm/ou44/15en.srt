1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,009
Shinni, you've given so easily men are all bastards.

2
00:00:07,009 --> 00:00:09,410
Not all men are bastards, just douche-batics.

3
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:12,369
Okay, no more talk about bastards.

4
00:00:12,369 --> 00:00:13,369
It's spoiling the mood.

5
00:00:13,369 --> 00:00:20,530
Let's go to DC and meet the head of the studio tomorrow and hopefully get a good deal.

6
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:37,659
No way the stupid men are above money.

7
00:00:37,659 --> 00:00:42,500
We have made more money, go buy a house and settle down to New York City.

8
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:43,700
What's going on?

9
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:44,700
Wait, what's going on?

10
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:57,159
Hi Miss White.

11
00:00:57,159 --> 00:00:59,159
I'm the lawyer.

12
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:00,159
I'm sitting in Kestin.

13
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:02,340
I'm in it.

14
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,340
They disappeared for a year ago holding me.

15
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:05,340
They are asking for the vote.

16
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,340
Today a lawyer comes up.

17
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,739
Something happened to him, baby.
