00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:06.790
Could it be that he's in debt in the solvent and the authorities have found out that we're

2
00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:11.839
married and they want me to pay it off for him knowing I have money?

3
00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:14.599
I don't have any money, don't look for me.

4
00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:24.559
For money, just a reminder that you and this marriage between you and it's not good for

5
00:00:24.559 --> 00:00:26.679
each other to keep dragging it out.

6
00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:30.679
As you said, come to wins at 8 o'clock tonight and we'll talk it over.

7
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:37.759
As long as they don't ask me to pay back to debt, okay, I'll see you tonight at 8 p.m.

8
00:00:37.759 --> 00:00:39.479
Okay, I'll see you at 8 p.m.

9
00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:42.340
Thank you.

10
00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.020
I've got a hold of your wife and made an appointment to talk about her 8 o'clock tonight.

11
00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.020
Are you coming?

12
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.020
Me?

13
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.149
Then what do I need you for as my lawyer?

14
00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:53.149
Yikes.

15
00:00:53.149 --> 00:01:02.380
Yes, tomorrow.

16
00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:10.760
You don't have to come to the office today, meet me at the airport and we'll fly to the west.

17
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:37.099
The one in the west makes me uncomfortable, luckily it's not affecting the world.

18
00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:39.700
Miss White, it's past 8 already, why aren't you here?
