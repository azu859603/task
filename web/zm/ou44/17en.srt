00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Ms. White, it's past eight already. Why aren't you here?

2
00:00:04,009 --> 00:00:07,509
I'm sorry, I've been rather busy lately. I can't see you now.

3
00:00:07,509 --> 00:00:10,509
Well, then when will we meet? Give me an exact time.

4
00:00:10,509 --> 00:00:13,509
Oh, Tony, go back. I'll get back to you when I'm available.

5
00:00:13,509 --> 00:00:16,510
You don't have time? Oh, you don't have one to divorce. Please tell.

6
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:32,929
People allow me to rest.

7
00:00:32,929 --> 00:00:51,229
Ginny, I see you feel uncomfortable, so I brought you some medicine.

8
00:00:51,229 --> 00:00:54,380
Thank you, Sophia.

9
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:59,299
Can I have a few words?

10
00:00:59,299 --> 00:01:01,299
What do you want to say?

11
00:01:01,299 --> 00:01:04,099
Do you know that Mr. Miller is married?

12
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:05,099
Yes.

13
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:10,099
If that's the case, you should be more wary of your conduct and not drive any wedge between Mr. and Mrs. Miller.

14
00:01:10,099 --> 00:01:13,099
Do you think there's something wrong with my conduct?

15
00:01:13,099 --> 00:01:16,959
Not really.

16
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:24,540
Then what's your point of telling me this? Going to call it a day.

17
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:40,719
Mr. Miller's new assistant is indeed young and pretty, but I can see she doesn't have a thing for Mr. Miller.

18
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:44,719
In case she thought Mr. Miller won't keep her around without you asking.

19
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:53,519
Yes, I'll keep an eye on her in the days to come.

20
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:54,519
Sophia?

21
00:01:54,519 --> 00:02:04,709
Mr. Miller, you...

22
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:08,969
That woman told you to spy on me and you had the balls to listen to her.
