1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,669
Mr. Miller, I think Madam was concerned.

2
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:03,830
Concerned about me?

3
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:06,030
Do I need her concern?

4
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,390
And what does that have anything to do with Ginny?

5
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:11,789
As you know, Madam likes the young lady from the Garcia family

6
00:00:11,789 --> 00:00:14,429
and has always wanted you two to be together.

7
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:15,869
And so she's worried that you're

8
00:00:15,869 --> 00:00:18,510
falling for other women.

9
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:21,030
Instead of worrying about my wife on paper,

10
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:24,510
she's concerned about my young assistant.

11
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,789
Madam knows that you married to appease your grandmother.

12
00:00:27,789 --> 00:00:29,070
But Ginny is different.

13
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,829
She is young, beautiful.

14
00:00:30,829 --> 00:00:33,429
And your personal secretary, the most important thing

15
00:00:33,429 --> 00:00:35,109
is that you began to fight for divorce

16
00:00:35,109 --> 00:00:37,229
shortly after Ginny became your secretary.

17
00:00:37,229 --> 00:00:39,789
For whatever reason I married that woman,

18
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:42,990
as long as that marriage license is there, she's mine.

19
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:45,909
Your boss should be glad that she didn't touch that woman.

20
00:00:45,909 --> 00:00:49,429
Or I will make her regret it for the rest of her life.

21
00:00:49,429 --> 00:00:50,990
Mr. Miller, then I am.

22
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:54,390
And keeping your job at M. Group

23
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,469
is the greatest mercy I've ever shown.
