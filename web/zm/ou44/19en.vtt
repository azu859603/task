00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:03.879
Good morning, Mr. Miller. There's something I need to clear up with you.

2
00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:05.980
What is it?

3
00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:10.980
Mr. Miller, my feelings for you are the respect that a subordinate has for a superior. That's it.

4
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.480
Do you think that I would think otherwise of you? A married woman?

5
00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.980
Mr. Miller, you're mocking at me. I'm very self-aware.

6
00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.480
I said this to you because I don't want the people around you to misjudge me.

7
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.140
Ginny White, your despicable name itself is enough reason for me to not fall for you.

8
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.929
Last time, Mr. Miller said my name was awful. I thought he was drunk.

9
00:00:33.929 --> 00:00:37.929
This time he's sober. How the hell did my name offend him?

10
00:00:37.929 --> 00:00:42.140
Ginny, are you feeling better?

11
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.140
Yeah, I'm back on my feet after a good night's sleep.

12
00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.140
Puts on a self-conscious mirror, willing to mask in front of me. It flicks freely with other men.

13
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.140
Mr. Miller, after visiting the villagers from door to door today, we've learned a lot of important information to better out these villagers.

14
00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.140
Ginny, you're as filthy as a monkey.

15
00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.140
Sir, your hands are much filtered in my face.

16
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.140
Mr. Miller, watch out.
