00:00:01.419 --> 00:00:03.419
Oh my god. Oh my god.

2
00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:07.049
Mr. Miller, are you okay?

3
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.759
What do you do to hurt yourself?

4
00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:14.259
I'm lucky to have not hurt any critical parts. I'm fine.

5
00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.440
Mike, call the doctor right now.

6
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:19.440
Consider it done.

7
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.440
Mr. Miller, there's no reception here. It doesn't get through.

8
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.500
Go to the hotel and fetch help!

9
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.500
Jenny, I'm going to take off your jacket and dress your wound to stop the bleeding first.

10
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.500
Bear with me.

11
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.500
Don't worry, Mr. Miller. I can take the pain.

12
00:00:37.619 --> 00:00:40.619
Cry out if it hurts, okay? Nobody would laugh at you.

13
00:00:40.619 --> 00:00:43.619
It's not a big deal. It's tolerable.

14
00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:46.009
Why tolerate it?

15
00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:52.009
Why tolerate it? I don't know. It's like ever since that passed away after the car accident.

16
00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:56.009
And I was mocked as a walking disaster. I've learned to tolerate.

17
00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:59.009
Are you hurt? Anywhere else?

18
00:00:59.009 --> 00:01:00.009
No.

19
00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:03.899
Okay. Let's get back.

20
00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.900
Of the doctor, run a thorough examination on you later.

21
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:13.689
Okay. Mr. Miller, we're both married. This doesn't look good. Please put me down.
