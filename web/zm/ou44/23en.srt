1
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:13,730
Grandma, why are you still up at this time?

2
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:17,129
I couldn't get hold of you. I'd be worried sick.

3
00:00:17,129 --> 00:00:20,629
Oh Grandma, I was too drowsy and passed out.

4
00:00:20,629 --> 00:00:22,129
Did you have dinner, Ginny?

5
00:00:22,129 --> 00:00:25,129
Have you been under a lot of pressure at work lately?

6
00:00:25,129 --> 00:00:29,129
Get another job if it's too demanding. Don't wear yourself out.

7
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:32,130
I'm fine Grandma. Don't worry about me.

8
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:35,630
What about you? Are you two tutoring the students?

9
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:38,130
I've got plenty of time.

10
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:44,799
Tutoring is not just earning me money, but also keeping my mind active.

11
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:46,799
Ginny, it's been a year.

12
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:49,789
Is my husband in love still work?

13
00:00:49,789 --> 00:00:52,289
I haven't had the chance to meet him at all.

14
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:54,289
Grandma, ever since I got married.

15
00:00:54,289 --> 00:00:57,289
All you talk about is your grandson in line the phone.

16
00:00:57,289 --> 00:00:59,289
Do you still care about me anymore?

17
00:00:59,289 --> 00:01:03,789
Oh, how could your grandma not care for you?

18
00:01:03,789 --> 00:01:13,159
I'm happy. I know you guys are busy with work and I'm going to go to New York.

19
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:18,159
To see you two and to drop by my long time BFF.

20
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:24,480
Shit, Grandma comes to New York City. There's no way to keep the divorce under wraps.
