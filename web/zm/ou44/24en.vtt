00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
You know, they have to give Grandma a heads up, or she will get too mad by that for sure.

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Grandma, a lot of people are not marrying these days, and nevertheless, they live a good life.

3
00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.269
It's other people's business if they don't get married.

4
00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.019
Now that you are married, you've got to take care of each other.

5
00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:22.019
But what if he doesn't want to take care of me?

6
00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:24.519
My granddaughter is a ten.

7
00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:32.259
There's a luck in the way he would not treasure you.

8
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.320
What if he's blind?

9
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.320
What? Is he blind?

10
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.820
No, I know he's been good to me.

11
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.320
Honest, Grandma is my long time-

12
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:47.869
Bestie trust her grandma's character, which was why I agreed to your marriage in the first place.

13
00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:50.210
Is he?

14
00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:51.210
Let's get a divorce.

15
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.210
I don't care.

16
00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:55.689
Grandma, I love you.

17
00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:58.189
I love you too, my dear granddaughter.

18
00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:59.189
Bye.

19
00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.030
Still awake?

20
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.030
How does he know I'm still up?

21
00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.530
He's not trying to get me up for work and in a middle of the night, is he?

22
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.530
And Mr. Miller, is there anything I can do for you?

23
00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:42.159
Male superior is knocking on the door of his female sub-born in his room in the middle of the night.

24
00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:46.969
Mr. Miller, you can just say it over the phone without knocking on my door.

25
00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:48.469
Who knocked on your door?

26
00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:52.180
It was not Elias who was knocking.

27
00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.180
Mr. Miller, I'll call you back later.

28
00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:06.890
Ginny, I shouldn't have said those things to you last night.

29
00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.389
I apologize to you.

30
00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:11.389
Will you talk to Mr. Miller and ask him not to fire me?

31
00:02:11.389 --> 00:02:15.389
I accept your apology, but as Mr. Miller wants you to leave.

32
00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:19.389
No, Ginny, you can change his decision because Mr. Miller is doing all this for you.
