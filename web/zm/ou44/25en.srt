1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,799
Ginny, I'm bad at you. You're the only one who can help me. If you don't see it for me, I'll kill myself.

2
00:00:05,799 --> 00:00:07,799
Sofia, let go of my arm.

3
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:10,300
I'm not letting you go where I'm dead. Don't you understand that?

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:11,300
Let it go!

5
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:22,140
Mr. Miller, I've apologized to Ginny. Please forgive me. Don't kick me out.

6
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,140
Bruce?

7
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:37,490
No, no.

8
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:46,409
I need to call Dr. Mary. Dr. Mary, I need you here right now. Please come.

9
00:00:46,409 --> 00:01:16,120
I told Sofia to leave M Group. It had nothing to do with you. Okay.

10
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:19,120
I know. I'm not as stupid as she is.

11
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:26,159
Sofia has been transferred to the West, not for long, but she's already lying her pocket pretty well.

12
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,390
Sofia looks like a decent person. I never thought that she would do it under your nose.

13
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:40,349
The situation here is quite complex. I'm gonna have to stay for a while. If you can't handle the climate, I'll have Bruce take you back first.

14
00:01:40,349 --> 00:01:42,849
It's okay. I can handle it.

15
00:01:42,849 --> 00:01:48,629
Ginny, don't be so stupid if this happens again.

16
00:01:48,629 --> 00:01:55,299
I didn't want to be stupid. It was an instinctive reaction at the moment.

17
00:01:55,299 --> 00:01:57,299
Does your husband know that you hurt?
