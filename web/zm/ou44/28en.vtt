00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.520
How many people know about this?

2
00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:04.000
It circulated all over the four families.

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.750
You've gone too far this time, bringing my grandma in.

4
00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:12.150
That young lady of the Garcia family is gorgeous and from my society.

5
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.150
And she's always been fascinated with you.

6
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.350
Yet you didn't, even lay your eyes on her.

7
00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:19.949
And instead, married and...

8
00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:27.980
You've gone too far this time bringing my grandma in.

9
00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.780
But let's talk about business.

10
00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.780
Let me do my job, okay?

11
00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.820
I can get your cheating wife to sign a divorce papers tonight.

12
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:36.619
Just say it.

13
00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:38.619
You have two hours.

14
00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:41.219
Two hours I want to see her sign divorce papers.

15
00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:59.380
Understand?

16
00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:05.810
Miss White, I'm your husband, Kasten's new term.

17
00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.810
Do you want to come out or should I come to your place?

18
00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.010
I'll go to your place.

19
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.469
Name a place?

20
00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:12.670
Moon Cafe?

21
00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:13.670
Right, okay.

22
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.030
I'm on my way.

23
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.629
Having coffee this late?

24
00:01:16.629 --> 00:01:19.230
Aren't you worried I'll keep you up all night?

25
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:20.230
What coffee?

26
00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:21.629
I'm going to divorce.

27
00:01:21.629 --> 00:01:26.430
Your husband really wasted no time coming to divorce you the moment you landed.

28
00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.420
What a son of a bitch will go with you.
