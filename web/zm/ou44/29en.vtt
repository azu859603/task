1
00:00:07.889 --> 00:00:14.589
Ms. White, my name is Pertus, and I will be handling the divorce case between you and Kastin from now on.

2
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.379
Take a look at this agreement.

3
00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.399
And sign it if you have no questions, please.

4
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.789
I gotta go through this. I never divorced before.

5
00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:37.679
You are a woman with a great sense of humor. No rush. Take your time.

6
00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:45.320
Alice is really trusting in a relationship, leaving such a beauty behind to go abroad alone.

7
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.780
Now some other guys weeping the benefit.

8
00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.939
Ms. White shall pay Mr. Miller $10 million for your emotional distress.

9
00:00:54.259 --> 00:01:00.640
Our grandparents arranged this marriage in the first place, and I haven't even met him once one year after we married.

10
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.739
Neither have we had any disputes. They ought to be a peaceful divorce, but I don't see how he would ask for this much money.

11
00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:10.049
Excuse me, Mr. Lin.

12
00:01:10.129 --> 00:01:15.390
Would you make a case for the $10 million in moral damages?

13
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:22.450
Ms. White, you shouldn't know the best what you've done. This woman must be a player, keeping her accord as by being cut into an act with her lover.

14
00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.659
What did I do?

15
00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.790
Ms. White, there are things that we should keep a little.

16
00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.890
But if you keep playing innocent, I'll have to get rough with you.

17
00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.500
You must sign this divorce agreement. It's not an option.
