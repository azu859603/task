1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,599
What are you gonna do if I don't sign it this what sign the agreement and everything else is negotiable

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,039
Do I look stupid to you?

3
00:00:08,439 --> 00:00:13,750
Tell kistan if he really wants a divorce

4
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:19,329
Let's make an appointment and go to civil affairs bureau if he wants to cheat money from me that I'm sorry

5
00:00:19,329 --> 00:00:21,329
He won't get a dime

6
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:41,909
Any problems Alice your wife is stunning

7
00:00:42,549 --> 00:00:44,619
You have half an hour

8
00:00:44,619 --> 00:00:49,390
Your wife won't sign the divorce papers why is she acting like that?

9
00:00:49,609 --> 00:00:51,109
Who the hell is she?

10
00:00:51,109 --> 00:00:56,229
It's not that she's not willing to sign it. It's that she's not willing to pay the ten million dollars and damages

11
00:00:56,229 --> 00:00:58,229
I don't care you take care of it

12
00:00:58,229 --> 00:01:19,750
The compensation clause is taken out miss white. Would you check it again?

13
00:01:34,489 --> 00:01:35,969
What else do I need to do?

14
00:01:35,969 --> 00:01:39,239
You're in the dark about what your husband does for a living aren't you?

15
00:01:39,969 --> 00:01:41,969
Does it have anything to do with me?

16
00:01:42,859 --> 00:01:45,260
Seems like she does have no idea who Alice is

17
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:50,799
She's gonna cry over the spilled milk after Alice reveals it to her after the divorce goes into effect

18
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:53,799
I will now file the divorce petition with the court

19
00:01:54,519 --> 00:02:00,040
And I will notify you and kistan to complete the procedures in one month

20
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:02,829
Okay
