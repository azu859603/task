1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
You can let that married woman go, okay?

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:06,030
What's the problem with being married?

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:14,029
Her husband is definitely not as good-looking rich as I am, but I really want her.

4
00:00:14,029 --> 00:00:16,030
She won't be able to escape no matter what.

5
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:17,030
She's mine!

6
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:21,250
Don't try to lay a finger on her.

7
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,250
Is she yours?

8
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,250
What do you mean one of yours?

9
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:28,859
She's your assistant, not your wife.

10
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:31,859
I caught her, and she falls from me.

11
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:33,859
What does it have anything to do with you?

12
00:00:33,859 --> 00:00:42,979
Alice, if you want her, go get her.

13
00:00:42,979 --> 00:00:44,979
Regardless if she's married or not.

14
00:00:44,979 --> 00:00:51,070
I don't believe there is a woman in this world who would say no to Alice.

15
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:56,979
Do I really want her? I don't know.

16
00:00:56,979 --> 00:00:59,979
But it doesn't just be off to see her being so intimate with that guy.

17
00:00:59,979 --> 00:01:08,290
Maybe because my marriage was a failure.

18
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:11,290
I envy her husband for having such a nice woman.

19
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:29,269
Ginny, your boss's wife is cheating on him,

20
00:01:29,269 --> 00:01:33,200
and he's sobbing and heart broke.

21
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,200
You better come and take him home.

22
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:41,609
I've done everything I can to get a pretty ear, and it's up to Alice himself to make a move.

23
00:01:41,609 --> 00:01:51,049
That's what happened to him. His wife cheated on him.
