00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.820
Guys, I'm going to Muse, boss is asking for me.

2
00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:07.820
What?

3
00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:11.769
Isn't your boss crossing the line now?

4
00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:13.449
Calling you out this late?

5
00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:16.170
As his personal assistant, it's unavoidable.

6
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.059
Can you quit the scrying?

7
00:00:19.059 --> 00:00:20.059
Yeah.

8
00:00:20.059 --> 00:00:21.059
Should we come with you?

9
00:00:21.059 --> 00:00:22.059
It's unsafe out night.

10
00:00:22.059 --> 00:00:26.059
Yeah, you've got to have a big man like me to protect you.

11
00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:27.059
Ouch.

12
00:00:27.059 --> 00:00:28.059
It's my job.

13
00:00:28.059 --> 00:00:30.059
I can't have your company every time.

14
00:00:30.059 --> 00:00:31.059
Don't worry, guys.

15
00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:32.060
I'm invincible.

16
00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.060
Okay.

17
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:34.060
Be careful.

18
00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:35.060
Bye.

19
00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:36.060
See ya.

20
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:52.289
Miss White has been a long time and missed you a lot.

21
00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:58.100
Mr. Smith, you lied to me?

22
00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.100
How dare I lie to you?

23
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:13.379
Do you want to make a move?

24
00:01:13.379 --> 00:01:15.469
What do you mean?

25
00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:23.359
You're Mr. Miller's wife cheated on him and is spreading like wild fire in our circle.

26
00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:28.579
Now many women want to win him over, but they have no chance to beat him.

27
00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:30.579
But you are different.

28
00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:33.700
You're with him every day.

29
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.540
This is your chance.

30
00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.549
You better keep your mouth shut.

31
00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:44.870
Alice's money is good looking and sexy.

32
00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.319
And he never falls around.

33
00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:52.900
Don't you have the slightest idea to marry him?

34
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:53.900
No, Mr. Smith.

35
00:01:53.900 --> 00:02:03.260
If you don't want me to lose my job, please be cautious it's your worst coming forward.

36
00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:04.260
Mr. Miller?
