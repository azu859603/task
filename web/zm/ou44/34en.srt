1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,200
Did she come to me? Why are you here again?

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:04,059
It's my duty?

3
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:11,250
You may go back and have Bruce pick me up.

4
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:14,050
Alice, cut the crap if you're drunk!

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,250
And let Miss White take you home.

6
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:19,449
Mr. Miller, let's go.

7
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:40,600
Not at all. It's my duty.

8
00:00:51,299 --> 00:00:54,200
Mr. Miller, are you allergic to alcohol again?

9
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,200
Grab me some water.

10
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:14,260
I know what it's like to be betrayed.

11
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,959
It ripped your heart out.

12
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:22,620
Mr. Miller, have some water, and then you can go to bed.

13
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,219
Mr. Miller, you should get some rest. I'll take off now.

14
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:39,890
Sleep here tonight.

15
00:01:40,689 --> 00:01:41,489
And don't leave.

16
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,379
Sleep here tonight. And don't leave.
