00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.580
You can't get an Uber at night in this villa area.

2
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.580
There were guest rooms on the second floor,

3
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.580
and you could just pick one to stay for the night.

4
00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.580
That's why Mr. Miller meant I'm the one who's making things up.

5
00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.579
No, thank you. I'm afraid I'll disturb your rest.

6
00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:20.829
I will be sleeping on the third floor, and you're on the second.

7
00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:23.829
So, how are you going to disturb me?

8
00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:29.339
It's 2am, and you will come over here tomorrow morning for work.

9
00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:33.039
You sure you want to go back?

10
00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:36.039
Okay, then I'll stay. I'm gonna go now.

11
00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:38.039
Good night, Mr. Miller.

12
00:00:38.039 --> 00:01:11.450
Mr. Miller got not even the pretty face, but also a hot body.

13
00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.450
What woman would cheat on such a flawless man?

14
00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.450
Unless...

15
00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.930
He's only got a pretty face, by not good and bad.

16
00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.989
Oh, guess Mr. Miller could not satisfy his wife,

17
00:01:23.989 --> 00:01:25.989
so she had an affair with another man?

18
00:01:25.989 --> 00:01:34.459
Mrs. Miller, you're back!
