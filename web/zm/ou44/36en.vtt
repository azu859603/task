I'm Jeannie. Mr. Miller's assistant. Mr. Miller got drunk last night, so I drove him back, and it was too late, so I stayed in the guest room on the second floor.

2
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
So, it's Miss White. I thought Mr. Miller had brought back his wife.

3
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.030
You, Miss White, do you have a boyfriend?

4
00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:23.030
I'm married.

5
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:27.030
No. You got married. So young.

6
00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:40.609
If only I could see her every day when I wake up.

7
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.640
Mr. Miller? Would you like some spaghetti?

8
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.640
No, thanks.

9
00:00:45.640 --> 00:01:01.109
He's not having it. Then I'll have another ball. I seem to be able to see his abs even now he's dressed up.

10
00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:05.420
Are you sure you can eat two balls?

11
00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:12.129
No, that the auntie has cooked this much. It'd be a waste if we throw them out as one might as well have two balls.

12
00:01:12.129 --> 00:01:17.780
Mr. Miller, would you like to try?

13
00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.480
Yeah, why not?

14
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:34.500
There you go. How is it? I'm not bad at it.

15
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.750
It's perfect.

16
00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.879
Mr. Miller, the spaghetti is made by Miss White, actually.

17
00:01:44.239 --> 00:01:49.239
Your husband is so lucky to have you, Miss White, to have married a woman who can cook so well.

18
00:01:49.239 --> 00:01:53.239
That's for sure. The man doesn't even appreciate me. It's his lack of taste.

19
00:01:53.239 --> 00:02:01.450
What's wrong with Mr. Miller?

20
00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.569
No idea.
