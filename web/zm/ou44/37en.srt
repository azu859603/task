1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,779
Mr. Miller, this is his schedule of activities for your birthday party.

2
00:00:03,779 --> 00:00:05,780
Oh, such a perfect match.

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:07,780
If only Chinyu was his wife.

4
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:10,580
Ah, what a pity he married someone else.

5
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:23,149
Alias, I'm back. I missed you so much.

6
00:00:23,149 --> 00:00:25,780
Who are you? What did you miss me?

7
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:29,179
That's a pretty director and brutal way to turn down a wall.

8
00:00:29,179 --> 00:00:31,179
Alice, don't you remember me?

9
00:00:31,179 --> 00:00:32,780
I'm Olivia Garcia.

10
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:35,780
You used to hug me, we were both kids.

11
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:40,380
You're Alice's wife?

12
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,380
Where did you get the balls to stay here?

13
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:44,380
You shameless bitch.

14
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:47,380
Have you not disgraced him enough? Get out.

15
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,380
What? What are you doing here?

16
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,380
Apologize to her right now.

17
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:52,380
Have you lost your mind?

18
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:55,380
You're being mean to me because of a woman who cheated on you?

19
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,380
This woman has slipped without the man.

20
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:00,859
Are you going to pretend nothing happened?

21
00:01:00,859 --> 00:01:03,859
Ms. Garcia, I'm Mr. Miller's assistant.

22
00:01:03,859 --> 00:01:06,859
And what does it have to do as Mr. Miller who I sleep with?

23
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:08,859
Chinyu's right. It's none of my business who she sleeps with.

24
00:01:08,859 --> 00:01:10,859
Why am I feeling upset about it?
