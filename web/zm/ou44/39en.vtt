00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320
This girl is gentle as a lamb in front of Mr. Miller, and as soon as Mr. Miller leaves,

2
00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.000
she throws her true colors.

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.140
Hmm, Auntie, I'm hungry.

4
00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:13.580
Can you make me something to eat?

5
00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:17.309
Hi, I'm at Alice's Place.

6
00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.309
I miss the old days, hang out with him as a little girl.

7
00:00:21.969 --> 00:00:23.010
Miss, what about it?

8
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.359
He's been shoulder all along.

9
00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:26.559
What do you fancy about him?

10
00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:28.800
Do you need a reason to like someone?

11
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.939
Anyway, I've been thinking about being Alice's bride

12
00:00:33.939 --> 00:00:36.340
since I was a little girl, you know?

13
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.219
And I'm not going to marry anyone.

14
00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:42.420
You can just point out where my performance is not up to scratch.

15
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.020
I'll try hard to meet your expectations.

16
00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:51.969
Did I say you're not performing?

17
00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:58.530
Then what did you mean, Alice?

18
00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.250
Here you are.

19
00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:03.600
You think just because you want it, you'll be my bride?

20
00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:06.030
Let me repeat this.

21
00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:09.620
If you don't want to disgrace the Garcia family,

22
00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.019
you better put away your fancy ideas.
