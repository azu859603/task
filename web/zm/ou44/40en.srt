1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,459
Alice, sorry.

2
00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:05,459
I know that if I say I like you now,

3
00:00:05,459 --> 00:00:08,460
it will make people think that you got divorced because of me

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:12,460
and overlooked the fact that that woman cheated on you first.

5
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:17,460
But I like you so much that I can't wait for the whole world to know.

6
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,460
I know. You don't have to like me.

7
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,460
But please don't hurt my heart.

8
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:28,190
First straight trauma it is, but I may work on men.

9
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:30,800
Don't play that game in front of me.

10
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,990
You think I got divorced because of you?

11
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:35,990
You think too highly of yourself?

12
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:37,990
You get the hell out of my house right now.

13
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:39,990
I don't want to waste another second with you.

14
00:00:41,539 --> 00:01:02,170
It has always rejected women from his life.

15
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:06,170
I've tried so many ways to get close to him and he turned me down.

16
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:08,170
All along.

17
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:13,519
How did that woman come and go from his house as she pleases?

18
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:16,519
And get so close to him.
