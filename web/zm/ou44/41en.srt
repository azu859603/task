1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,710
It's not that men can recognize a scheming woman, it's just that some men pretend dumb.

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:06,209
What are you laughing at?

3
00:00:06,209 --> 00:00:08,240
Am I laughing?

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,880
I had nothing to do with that woman.

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,880
Mr. Miller, this is your private stuff, you don't have to tell me.

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,879
Mr. Miller, if there's nothing else...

7
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:20,230
Jenny, remember what I told you.

8
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:21,329
What?

9
00:00:21,329 --> 00:00:25,329
Remember that you're my assistant, at or out of workplace.

10
00:00:25,329 --> 00:00:28,329
Nobody gets to push you around because you're one of mine.

11
00:00:28,329 --> 00:00:30,329
You don't have to be afraid of Olivia.

12
00:00:30,329 --> 00:00:33,329
You're the Garcia family behind her.

13
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:36,060
Mr. Miller.

14
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,799
As long as you're still working for me.

15
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:40,799
I'm group. We'll protect you.

16
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:42,500
You got it?

17
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,979
I got it. Thank you, Mr. Miller.

18
00:00:45,979 --> 00:01:06,650
Ms. White, somebody would like to see you. Please get in.

19
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:07,650
Who is that somebody?

20
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:12,340
Ms. White, you'll know when you get there.

21
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:24,719
Now she's here.

22
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:30,269
Leave us alone.

23
00:01:30,269 --> 00:01:33,269
Ms. White, excuse me for inviting you here in this manner.
