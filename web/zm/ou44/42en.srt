1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:03,069
I am Mr. Miller's mom.

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,620
Mrs. Miller, what do you want to see me?

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:08,939
Miss Wyatt, have a seat.

4
00:00:08,939 --> 00:00:09,939
You can just say it.

5
00:00:09,939 --> 00:00:13,939
Why don't you sit down and have a cup of tea and we'll talk about it.

6
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:40,270
Are you afraid that I poisoned the tea?

7
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:42,270
Do I look like a bad person?

8
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:45,270
Well, not a bad person who might take a guess like this.

9
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,270
I just want to know what you think about Alice.

10
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:49,270
What do you feel about him?

11
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:51,270
Would any girls fancy him?

12
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:56,270
These years Mr. Miller has been at the top of the list of men in New York City would like to marry.

13
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:58,299
Of course girls fancy him.

14
00:00:58,299 --> 00:01:00,299
So do you like him?

15
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:01,299
Do you want to marry him?

16
00:01:01,299 --> 00:01:03,299
You could tell me the truth.

17
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:08,299
And if you like him, I'll let him marry you and we'll be mother and daughter-in-law.

18
00:01:08,299 --> 00:01:14,370
Mrs. Miller, I'm Mr. Miller's assistant and our past only crossed out of workplace.

19
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:17,370
I don't have anything for him that I'm not supposed to have.

20
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:20,370
What do you mean something you're not supposed to have?

21
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:28,120
Love is the most wonderful thing in the world and the most uncontrollable emotion.

22
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,120
How is it something you're not going to have?

23
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:36,280
Mrs. Miller, I'm married and I love my husband so very much.

24
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:40,299
So much. Really?

25
00:01:40,299 --> 00:01:42,299
Do you believe yourself when you say that?

26
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:50,689
Last Friday night, after you signed the divorce papers, you ran off to Alice's place and stayed for the night.

27
00:01:50,689 --> 00:01:54,930
Love your husband.

28
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:58,909
You're stalking me?

29
00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:01,010
More than stalking you.

30
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:06,010
I've got to the bottom, including how you seduced your neighbor in your sophomore year.
