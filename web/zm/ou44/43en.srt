00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:18,289
Mrs. Miller you can just stop beating around the bush. What exactly is your point? Leave your job right now and leave Alice

2
00:00:18,289 --> 00:00:22,910
Leave New York City and never said put in this town again. I'm sorry, but I'm going to let you down

3
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:26,050
I'll never leave my job much less New York City

4
00:00:26,449 --> 00:00:30,890
You two look fairly cute, but there are many girls prettier than you

5
00:00:31,129 --> 00:00:35,219
Are you sure you can have Alice wrapped around your finger?

6
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:40,659
My job is not having him wrapped around my finger. I'm giving you two choices right now

7
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:47,219
One is to leave New York City right now. The other is to leave after you fall from grace

8
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:52,020
Ginny, you're smart. You know what to choose

9
00:00:52,939 --> 00:00:58,100
My butt off day and night only to make money so I can have a place of my own in New York City

10
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:01,899
I've never been so delusional about this man. I did nothing wrong

11
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:07,459
You shouldn't have forgotten how you left MC City in the Inglorious manner back there

12
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:12,120
Said I'm not leaving my job, and I'm not leaving New York City

13
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,920
Mrs. Miller if you want to play dirty and go ahead. I'll play along
