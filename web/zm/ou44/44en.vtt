00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:08.869
Mrs. Miller, I know that the Miller family has the power, but, you touch me?

2
00:00:08.869 --> 00:00:10.869
It means you inverse Mr. Miller.

3
00:00:10.869 --> 00:00:21.449
You think too much of yourself.

4
00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.449
Do you think my own son would turn against me for an assistant like you?

5
00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:28.449
You should know his personality better than me.

6
00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:32.119
And what are you afraid of?

7
00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.490
Otto, send Miss White them.

8
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:52.539
Oh, oh.

9
00:00:52.539 --> 00:01:00.810
Madam, are you really worried that Mr. Miller will turn against you for this assistant of his?

10
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:01.810
What, assistant?

11
00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.810
She's the woman the old lady told Alice to marry.

12
00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:06.810
What?
