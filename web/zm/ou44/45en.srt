1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
What?

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,799
Ginny is the woman we've been trying to turn off but in vain.

3
00:00:03,799 --> 00:00:08,400
Then an old lady was worried about me going after her and protected her well.

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,800
For more than a year, I wasn't able to find out who Alice was married to, however I tried.

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,399
So Ginny is Mr. Miller's wife?

6
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:19,600
Then why didn't she reveal herself?

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,800
That's what's so spooky about this woman.

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:27,800
She goes to great length to get close to Alice, first to make Alice fall in love with her over time

9
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:34,799
and reveal who she is when the time is right so that she can secure her position if the new Mrs. Miller.

10
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:38,799
Mr. Miller is kept in the dark about it?

11
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:45,799
Alice has always been obedient to the old lady and was serious about forming a family with that woman.

12
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:50,799
It was only after he misidentified someone else as Ginny

13
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:56,799
and thought that his wife was cheating on him that he wanted a divorce.

14
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:00,340
So what do we do now?

15
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:04,620
They have signed the divorce agreement.

16
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:09,620
In a month they will inevitably meet as they go to court to walk through the procedures.

17
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:12,620
Ginny presumably is waiting for this day.

18
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:25,670
So we have one month to either seal the divorce without letting them meet each other or come up with the smoking gun.

19
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:28,670
Proving Ginny was cheating on him.

20
00:01:29,769 --> 00:01:35,060
Okay, I'll take care of that madam.

21
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,060
Mr. Miller!

22
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:40,099
How much has Alice heard?
