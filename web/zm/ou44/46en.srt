1
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,449
Bruce, send this woman to Africa.

2
00:00:10,449 --> 00:00:13,449
No, please Mr. Miller, forgive me, I won't dare to do something.

3
00:00:13,449 --> 00:00:14,449
Let's go.

4
00:00:14,449 --> 00:00:22,019
Please, honey, wish us you a happy birthday.

5
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:26,019
And get rid of that filthy woman who cheated on you.

6
00:00:26,019 --> 00:00:30,960
Did he really hear it?

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,960
For all of these years, I've done so many things for your benefit.

8
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,960
How dare you say something today about Chining?

9
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,960
This is the very last time.

10
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,960
Otherwise, you'll be soon seeing some of my tricks.

11
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:51,640
You came all this way today to warn me not to touch your young assistant.

12
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,640
Are you serious?

13
00:00:53,640 --> 00:01:07,510
It seems he hasn't found out who Jenny is yet.

14
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:12,280
But he knows that she's on our radar.

15
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:16,280
This has to be done discreetly and our names must not get involved.

16
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,280
Yes, ma'am.

17
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,280
Just do it now!

18
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,500
Let's get her out of New York City today in the most glorious way possible.

19
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,500
Thank you.
