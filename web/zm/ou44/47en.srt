00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:27,140
Sofia, where are we going to get the wedding invitations for you and Mr. Miller?

2
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:28,140
Look at her.

3
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,980
It's clear around the corner the new Miss Miller is right on the way.

4
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:32,979
I know right.

5
00:00:32,979 --> 00:00:35,140
Geez, stop making fun of me.

6
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:49,189
We're not.

7
00:00:49,189 --> 00:01:10,200
Assistant Jenny, my feet hurt.

8
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,000
Go get me a glass of juice.

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,540
Little bitch, are you deaf?

10
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:20,269
Why would you order me around?

11
00:01:20,269 --> 00:01:22,829
You're just an assistant serving tea around.

12
00:01:22,829 --> 00:01:24,840
How come we a pride?

13
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,010
Believe it or not, I can get you kicked out of New York City.

14
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:32,849
Another one wanting me to get the hell out of New York City.

15
00:01:32,849 --> 00:01:37,129
I am Mr. Miller's assistant and the only orders I take are from Mr. Miller.

16
00:01:37,129 --> 00:01:41,450
Try to become Mrs. Miller first, then you can bark orders at me and I'll be happy to lick

17
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:44,719
her boot.

18
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:45,400
Go off me!
