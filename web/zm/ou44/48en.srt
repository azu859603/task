1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
Alice, please don't blame Jenny. She didn't mean to hit me.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,000
Her tells she is the junior, spoils the fuck.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Of course I won't blame her.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Be glad your fist didn't hit her just now, otherwise.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,140
Hey, you good?

6
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:19,140
We're going to play murder mystery, Alice.

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,140
Jenny, you guys wanna join us?

8
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:24,140
You guys have fun, I'm not in.

9
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:28,260
Not interested either.

10
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:34,049
Alright then, let's go. Let's go have fun.

11
00:00:34,049 --> 00:00:37,679
Olivia, come on.

12
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:46,979
Mr. Miller, thank you.

13
00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:48,979
Why don't you go play the game?

14
00:00:48,979 --> 00:00:53,659
Is there anything you want to tell me?

15
00:00:53,659 --> 00:00:56,729
Yes, but I don't dare to say it.

16
00:00:56,729 --> 00:01:03,179
Miss White, if you tell Mr. Miller about the ladies' visit today, your grandmother and MCC will be in danger.

17
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:07,180
You have so much to attach you.

18
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:09,180
Your grandma doesn't.
