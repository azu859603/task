1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,399
Mr. Miller, I'm going to see if the guests are having a good time.

2
00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:09,500
I'm sorry. I'm sorry about what happened today, but I've taken care of it.

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:15,660
And she won't dare to bother you again. You can concentrate on your work, okay?

4
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:21,660
With a few words, Mr. Miller had the fear and the sense of how the loss hit within me smashed to pieces.

5
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,660
If I were her husband, I would have held her tightly in my arm.

6
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:29,660
You're sharing that with me by her side. There's nothing to fear.

7
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:34,719
I'm just a boss. The man who's entitled to hug her can never be me.

8
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:40,270
Thank you.

9
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:43,270
I'll let the driver take you back if you're not in the mood.

10
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:45,270
Well, have you ever played murder mystery before?

11
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,270
I'm never played, but it sounds fun.

12
00:00:47,270 --> 00:01:00,990
Hey! I thought you guys were incoming. I got upset about it for a while. Come and join us.

13
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:02,920
Have a seat.

14
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:08,230
We are a team, Olivia. Let's go over there.

15
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:26,180
You're my wife. There's no rush.

16
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:36,930
We got plenty of time later back in the room.

17
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:42,780
It's my date. I've got such a gorgeous wife.

18
00:01:46,219 --> 00:01:49,219
Want to play husband and wife with Ginny?
