1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Afro-dizi?

2
00:00:07,349 --> 00:00:21,000
Jenny. Jenny.

3
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:38,020
Mr. Miller, who drugged us? Why did he set us up?

4
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:41,759
There's a strange scent in the room.

5
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:46,820
I smelled it as soon as I entered the house. I thought I was perfume.

6
00:00:48,369 --> 00:00:51,369
So, Mr. Miller, the drug was put in the room first.

7
00:00:52,369 --> 00:00:54,369
It's possible that it wasn't aimed at you and me?

8
00:00:54,369 --> 00:00:58,369
Oh no. This room was originally arranged for me and Ken.

9
00:00:58,369 --> 00:01:01,369
If I had been honored to influence of drugs and sex with Ken,

10
00:01:01,369 --> 00:01:07,370
I would have been ashamed and forced to leave New York City in the most possible and glorious manner.

11
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:12,659
It's not random. Everyone thinks Ken is a playboy and will ace fingers on every woman.

12
00:01:13,659 --> 00:01:18,049
You think it's me?

13
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:22,049
No. Your mother. I think she's coming from me.

14
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:26,340
And Ken is nothing more than a randomly picked tool.

15
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:31,340
But no one expected you and him to switch rules before the game started.

16
00:01:38,989 --> 00:01:42,989
Jenny, don't worry. Nobody's gonna walk away from this.
