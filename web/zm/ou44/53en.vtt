00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.839
I didn't seduce. I didn't.

2
00:00:02.839 --> 00:00:04.200
Jenny, wake up.

3
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.639
You're having a nightmare.

4
00:00:05.639 --> 00:00:06.639
Jenny. No.

5
00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:07.960
Jenny, wake up.

6
00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.039
Jenny.

7
00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:10.080
Silly girl.

8
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.800
Take her time off to go home if you miss your mom.

9
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.109
You don't have to keep it to yourself.

10
00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:18.679
Don't marry us, you.

11
00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:25.989
Oh, Mr. Miller, is he all right?

12
00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:31.179
Yes, he's got a strong body, and he'll be fine.

13
00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:39.799
Pigs will fly if she's fine after getting drugged with him.

14
00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:42.399
Mr. Miller, the birthday gift from the scion

15
00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:43.920
of the Precious family.

16
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.560
He demanded you to open it yourself.

17
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.479
I've checked it, and there's no hazardous material.

18
00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:56.950
You want to open it?

19
00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.070
Mr. Miller, why is the sign of the Precious family?

20
00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.670
The rumors circling out there say that Mr. Miller never

21
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.269
could close to woman, and the big four families

22
00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:07.989
gossip about the president's wife cheating on his arm.

23
00:01:07.989 --> 00:01:11.189
Does Mr. Miller really have some kind of unspeakable disease?
