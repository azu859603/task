1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,639
Wrap them up with transparent material, and deliver it to purchase his office when he gets back.

2
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:07,000
Yes, sir.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,789
Mr. Miller, I'll leave you to it then.

4
00:00:15,789 --> 00:00:18,289
Felix, you ask Bruce to send her off.

5
00:00:18,289 --> 00:00:27,379
You better get back now, and I'll put you back on the trip.

6
00:00:27,379 --> 00:00:32,880
The second you heard that the assistant Jenny has woken up, you pulled the trip and came over, and you ignored her.

7
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,380
What's on your mind?

8
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:41,079
Miss White, Mrs. Miller has already flown abroad, and those minions under her have been taken care of.

9
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:47,030
No one will be looking to trouble you again.

10
00:00:47,030 --> 00:01:01,219
I appreciate it.

11
00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:03,719
Miss White, what a coincidence.

12
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:05,719
Mr. Purchase?

13
00:01:05,719 --> 00:01:07,510
You remember me.

14
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:11,010
Are you dining alone with your friends?

15
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:14,010
With my boyfriend, got a problem with that?

16
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,010
Oh, looks like the cheating is real.

17
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:31,480
Alice, if a man is betrayed, how would you comfort him?

18
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,420
What are you trying to say?

19
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:38,920
I just saw your wife, and her lover, dining at this restaurant.

20
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,920
Would you like to go over and say hello?
