1
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:16,129
Timoth, Alice, wait, you were a husband and wife after all, and you're not the only man

2
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:22,800
in the world who's been betrayed and form her about the divorce proceedings tomorrow, understand?

3
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:39,789
Consider it done, don't worry, as long as she's in New York City she can't get away with it

4
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:49,119
to come to New York City Courthouse tomorrow and the proceedings, okay?

5
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:53,409
What is it? One of the three great things in life.

6
00:00:53,409 --> 00:00:58,530
Oh, let's see, promotion? Is it salary raise or husband dead?

7
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,989
You're close. The lawyer notified me to go to the divorce proceedings tomorrow.

8
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:11,150
I'm going to be a single woman again soon, although my previous life was not much different

9
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:17,500
than being single. The marital status does complicate things, and I did not

10
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,260
to have any fancy ideas towards other students.

11
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:22,299
Join your day, huh? We must celebrate tonight.

12
00:01:22,299 --> 00:01:25,629
Cheers! Cheers! To a single life!

13
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,980
Grandma, I'm out having me all with Jason and Mick.

14
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,859
It's Jenny, right? It's MC Central Hospital.
