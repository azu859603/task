1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,500
It was all just hearsay, and nobody saw what happened back then, and we all must have our own judgment about what's wrong and what's right.

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:13,000
Here's say, the video clip of her cotton bed is still here, I'll offer it to anyone interested, for free.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm not interested. I'm busy here.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,190
You've been defending this little bitch.

5
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:20,190
I'm not interested in that.

6
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:21,190
Does she teach you how to seduce men?

7
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:24,190
You filthy slanderer. Go away!

8
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:29,750
Oh, what are you doing? What are you doing?

9
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:35,750
I'm not interested in stirring up trouble in the hospital and slandering. We are now taking you back for questions.

10
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:39,850
When did I slander anyone? This is arbitrary arrest. I'm suing you for slandering.

11
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:49,850
Come on, officer. This phone contains video clips, showing how this couple acted up in the hospital, as well as their verbal abuse and defamation behaviors.

12
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:55,850
Oh, rest them. I did swear. So what? I was swearing at my own family. Does that have anything to do with others?

13
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:57,850
I'm not the same genie anymore.

14
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:01,850
But you guys are still the same, as nasty as ever.

15
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:04,849
You guys are not worth the time of day.

16
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:06,849
You watch your little bitch.

17
00:01:06,849 --> 00:01:14,329
Miss White, you foretell a thing like a prophet.

18
00:01:14,329 --> 00:01:17,329
I'm not a prophet, but it will have its eye heart for that couple.

19
00:01:17,329 --> 00:01:20,329
Now they're both going to be in custody for a while.

20
00:01:20,329 --> 00:01:24,329
A few days' detention is too lenient on them. Take the evidence I gave you earlier and submit them.

21
00:01:24,329 --> 00:01:27,329
I'm going to make everyone who has sent me a back then pay the price.

22
00:01:27,329 --> 00:01:30,579
Don't worry. I'm on it.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,340
Grandma.

24
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:39,700
Genie. My grandson-in-law didn't come with you?

25
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,700
Grandma, he is not available to see you. Why don't you come with me to New York City for him?

26
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:46,700
This way I can trip Grandma to go to New York City for better health care.

27
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:47,700
What? My condition!

28
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,700
Grandma, do you want to see him or not?

29
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:55,790
Grandma has so much to tell him. I'm only afraid he won't want to listen to.

30
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:57,790
An old woman nagging.

31
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:01,790
You're a senior. If he didn't listen to you, I'd make him regret.

32
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:05,859
How am I going to come and feast and play along by then?

33
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:10,719
Sounds like my granddaughter has a big say in the new family.

34
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:13,719
Okay. I'll go to New York City as you said.

35
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:15,719
Okay. I'll make the arrangement then.

36
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:18,909
No hurry. I have something for you.

37
00:02:18,909 --> 00:02:27,199
Genie. Your father's compensation for the car accident

38
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:31,199
and the money I left you are all in this card.

39
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:33,199
The passcode is your birthday.

40
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:38,199
Grandma, I am making money. I don't want your money. I just want you to be healthy.

41
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:42,199
Full girl. I know you are making money.

42
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:47,199
Some of the money is the compensation for your father's death and some is saved by me.

43
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:50,199
I hope you will be good to yourself. You've got to take it.

44
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:52,199
Grandma, I'll take it then.

45
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:54,840
That's my girl.

46
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,840
I'll figure out a way to return the money to Grandma.

47
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,840
Genie. It's been a year and a half since you and Caston got married.

48
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,969
But I don't see your belly getting round.

49
00:03:05,969 --> 00:03:13,099
Grandma, we're still young. There's no rational babies.

50
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:18,099
Caston is 28 and you'll be 24 in a few days.

51
00:03:18,099 --> 00:03:20,099
Isn't it about the time?

52
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:27,060
Although, baked in the character of the child brought up by my longtime bestie.

53
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:30,060
Oh, men are playful creatures in nature.

54
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:35,069
It's more settled.

55
00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:37,069
Be a miracle to my belly round up.

56
00:03:37,069 --> 00:03:40,069
Caston and I haven't even had the chance to get laid.

57
00:03:40,069 --> 00:03:43,069
Grandma is getting late. He should get the rest.

58
00:03:43,069 --> 00:03:47,069
Do you think your grandma is nosy? Or are you hiding things from me?

59
00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:53,069
No, Grandma, you know that I haven't even promoted for six months and I traveled a lot for work.

60
00:03:53,069 --> 00:03:55,069
It's not the time to have babies.

61
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:58,259
Cast, you're right.

62
00:03:58,259 --> 00:04:00,259
To have a stay in the family.

63
00:04:00,259 --> 00:04:05,259
Totally. The inside of a veteran teacher is indeed something else.

64
00:04:05,259 --> 00:04:08,259
Yeah, Grandma, you should rest.

65
00:04:08,259 --> 00:04:20,730
Miss White, what the hell do you want?

66
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:25,879
Mr. Lin, please tell Keith that I can't divorce him for the time being.

67
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:27,879
Miss White, we can't go back on our words.

68
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:29,879
You signed the divorce agreement.

69
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:33,740
Today's the day to wrap this up. Why are you backing out now?

70
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,740
I just want to postpone it and not cancel it all together.

71
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:37,740
Why so?

72
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:41,740
Because my grandma is sick and is bringing up her grandson in the hall day long.

73
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:45,740
If I tell her I'm divorcing, it will only make her conditions worse.

74
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:50,379
So I thought of waiting for her before going through the divorce thing.

75
00:04:50,379 --> 00:04:53,149
Can we have some decency here?

76
00:04:53,149 --> 00:04:57,399
If your grandma's all, just take your boyfriend.

77
00:04:57,399 --> 00:04:59,399
Why must you hold up the thing with Caston?

78
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:00,399
My boyfriend?

79
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:03,500
Right. I told him I had a boyfriend before.

80
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,500
Whatever I got myself into.

81
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:09,689
This woman is obviously stalling because she has found out about Caston's true identity.

82
00:05:09,689 --> 00:05:10,689
She wants more money.

83
00:05:10,689 --> 00:05:12,689
Name your price.

84
00:05:12,689 --> 00:05:13,689
What price?

85
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:16,689
What? You don't know how much you want yourself?

86
00:05:16,689 --> 00:05:19,689
I just want my grandmother to get well.

87
00:05:19,689 --> 00:05:24,170
Do you even believe yourself? You don't love him.

88
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:25,170
So what clicked her?

89
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:29,490
How much money it will take for you to divorce him?

90
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:31,490
Who cares about his money?

91
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:36,060
I'm not accused and is truly a scumbag.

92
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:39,060
It's not like I can't make money. What the hell wants his money?

93
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:47,860
What?

94
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:48,860
It's just unbelievable.

95
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,860
Cheating on you with that straight face.

96
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:53,980
For the divorce proceedings.

97
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,980
And then lying about your grandmother.

98
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:56,980
Grandma, they're getting sick.

99
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,819
It's haunted.

100
00:05:58,819 --> 00:06:02,389
But don't worry. This time, I will make it.

101
00:06:02,389 --> 00:06:04,389
What? Her grandmother's sick?

102
00:06:04,389 --> 00:06:05,389
That's what she said.

103
00:06:05,389 --> 00:06:07,389
Well, send her some money.

104
00:06:07,389 --> 00:06:09,389
So that she will take care of her grandma.

105
00:06:09,389 --> 00:06:12,519
And then you can wait until her grandma gets better.

106
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:13,519
Okay.

107
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:14,519
Are you sure?

108
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:15,519
Yes.

109
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:29,220
Sir, my mom says she doesn't want to hear your voice.

110
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,660
Place.

111
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:36,689
You tell grandma that the woman's grandmother seems to be sick.

112
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:38,230
What?

113
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:42,860
Jenny's grandmother is sick.

114
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:47,709
What is it earlier? You little brat?

115
00:06:47,709 --> 00:07:04,819
Grandma Jane?

116
00:07:04,819 --> 00:07:09,250
Miss Merler, this morning.

117
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,379
Where is Jenny?

118
00:07:10,379 --> 00:07:13,379
Jenny is on her annual leave 10 days.

119
00:07:13,379 --> 00:07:18,379
It's our busiest time toward the end of the year and she takes her annual leave at this time?

120
00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:22,889
If I remember correctly, the president is going to be important.

121
00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:27,139
The coffee is cold. We'll get another one.

122
00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:31,529
Yes, sir.

123
00:07:31,529 --> 00:07:33,529
The president is like a ticking time bomb.

124
00:07:33,529 --> 00:07:49,389
Jenny, come back to rescue me.

125
00:07:49,389 --> 00:07:55,079
Jenny, I want to have a few words with you.

126
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:58,079
Jenny, I want to have a few words with you.

127
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:00,180
What is it, grandma?

128
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,180
This kid isn't just a looker.

129
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:06,180
Those eyes are pure innocence. Hard not to like her.

130
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,180
If you need help, give me a shout.

131
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,180
We're family.

132
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:11,180
As for my grandson.

133
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,180
Until you two officially split.

134
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:15,180
Your husband and wife.

135
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:17,180
And it's his duty to lend a hand.

136
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:22,709
Okay, I won't bother him. I don't owe him a favor.

137
00:08:22,709 --> 00:08:29,980
Jenny.

138
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:33,980
Is Kestin done with his work? Can I see him tomorrow?

139
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:38,259
I'll talk to him tomorrow.

140
00:08:38,259 --> 00:08:43,590
Kestin, I'm really sorry.

141
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:48,590
My grandma is seriously ill and she keeps asking to see her grandson in law every day.

142
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:53,590
I can't break the news to her, so I am not going to divorce you for now.

143
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:57,590
If you are available, could you please come to the hospital to visit her?

144
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:59,590
Just act like a loving couple for a while.

145
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:03,590
And once her conditions have improved, I promise I'll...

146
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:07,690
Jenny, why don't you just call Kestin?

147
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:11,690
Grandma, he's busy at work and it's not convenient for him to answer calls sometimes.

148
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:13,690
Is that right?

149
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:19,129
Kestin, could you reply to my message if you see it?

150
00:09:19,129 --> 00:09:23,710
Sure.

151
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:30,230
Thank you for agreeing to see my grandmother.

152
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:33,230
May I ask when you are coming so I can make the arrangements?

153
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:36,230
Fine. I'll meet your grandma, but I don't want to see you.

154
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:42,080
Let's schedule a time. I'll make sure to avoid you.

155
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,080
Tomorrow afternoon.

156
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:51,389
When the hell is Jenny coming back?

157
00:09:51,389 --> 00:09:55,549
I don't know, Mr. Mother. Get lost.

158
00:09:55,549 --> 00:10:04,279
I've sent you the address. Please don't tell Grandma that we are good and good divorce. Thank you very much.

159
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:07,730
Grandma, Kestin has agreed to come and see you tomorrow.

160
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:13,730
Oh, oh, oh, good, good. Jenny should grab a tidy up a bit.

161
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:17,730
It's the first time meeting your husband. I gotta leave a good impression on him.

162
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:21,730
Grandma, he's your grandson-in-law and not some big shot.

163
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:25,730
Oh, he's more important than any big shot in my heart.

164
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:27,730
Oh, Kestin will speak?

165
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:37,139
Come in. Come in. You must be Kestin.

166
00:10:37,139 --> 00:10:39,139
Grandma, how are you?

167
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:44,870
What a candy on the eyes. Sit down. Let me have a good look at you.

168
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:53,629
You heard from Jenny that you're busy with work.

169
00:10:53,629 --> 00:10:56,629
How are you getting along with Jenny then?

170
00:10:56,629 --> 00:11:02,110
Anna, I want to have a private chat with my grandson-in-law. Would you excuse us?

171
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:06,039
Yeah, sure. That guy is just smoking hot.

172
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:13,039
Thank you. I'm so happy that you took time amid your busy schedule to come see me.

173
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:17,090
It's the least I can do.

174
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:21,090
And Jenny, I hadn't spent any time together before you married.

175
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:24,090
But because there's no spark between you two.

176
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:31,090
It's so important to take time and cultivate the relationship so you can't sacrifice family for work.

177
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:33,090
Yes, sure.

178
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:39,090
Jenny has a strong personality. She doesn't show her weaknesses in front of others.

179
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:43,090
She just keeps it to herself, so please take care of her.

180
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:45,620
Sure.

181
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:49,620
Kestin, did you and Jenny have a spat or something else?

182
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:55,620
Don't worry, Grandma. We are fine. As you just said, we didn't have any chemistry between us before marriage

183
00:11:55,620 --> 00:12:03,690
and have been apart for most of the time after, so we are still in the bonding stage.

184
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:09,750
After more than a year of marriage and they're still just bonding, they definitely have a problem.

185
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:16,820
You know this time, Jenny has been putting on a happy face, coaxing me along the way.

186
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,879
Kestin, just be honest with me.

187
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:24,879
Are you two not doing well in your relationship?

188
00:12:24,879 --> 00:13:27,600
Come in. You must be Kestin.

189
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:33,659
What a candy on the eyes. Sit down. Let me have a good look at you.

190
00:13:33,659 --> 00:13:41,100
How are you?

191
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:46,100
From Jenny, that you're busy with work. How are you getting along with Jenny then?

192
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:53,360
To have a private chat with my grandson-in-law. Would you excuse us?

193
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,100
Yes, sure. That guy is just smoking hot.

194
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,220
Thank you. Thank you.

195
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:04,220
I'm so happy that you took time amid your busy schedule to come see me.

196
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:06,899
It's the least I can do.

197
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:12,899
You and Jenny, I hadn't spent any time together before you married, but because there's no spark between you two.

198
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:20,899
It's so important to take time and cultivate the relationship so you can't sacrifice family for work.

199
00:14:20,899 --> 00:14:22,090
Yes, sure.

200
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:33,220
Jenny has a strong personality. She doesn't show her weaknesses in front of others. She just keeps it to herself, so please take care of her.

201
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,110
Sure.

202
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:39,110
Kestin, did you and Jenny have a spat or something else?

203
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:42,110
Don't worry, grandma. We are fine.

204
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:50,110
As you just said, we didn't have any chemistry between us before marriage and have been apart for most of the time after it.

205
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:53,110
So we are still in the bonding stage.

206
00:14:53,110 --> 00:15:00,269
After more than a year of marriage and they're still just bonding, they definitely have a problem.

207
00:15:00,269 --> 00:15:06,269
At all this time, Jenny has been putting on a happy face, coaxing me along the way.

208
00:15:07,429 --> 00:15:10,429
Kestin, just be honest with me.

209
00:15:10,429 --> 00:15:14,429
Are you two not doing well in your relationship?

210
00:15:14,429 --> 00:15:19,710
Can you handle it if I tell you that your granddaughter has been sleeping around?

211
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:27,679
Take care of yourself, grandma. I'll come to visit again.

212
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:29,679
Are you two divorced?

213
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:32,679
Not officially yet, but we're heading back.

214
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:35,679
Why? No love or...

215
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:37,679
Other reasons?

216
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:39,679
Any chance of patching things up?

217
00:15:42,059 --> 00:15:45,409
Thank you for telling me the truth.

218
00:15:45,409 --> 00:15:50,539
Don't tell Jenny yet until I figure out how to break it to her.

219
00:15:50,539 --> 00:15:55,799
Sure. Take care.

220
00:15:55,799 --> 00:16:01,799
Now, it seems that the marriage I tried hard to set up has a secret, mom.

221
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:18,580
Come to see me.

222
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:23,149
Look, he's also considerate.

223
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:28,860
A single room arranged for two caregivers to take turns looking after me.

224
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:35,309
You don't have to come to the hospital today.

225
00:16:35,309 --> 00:16:37,409
Take a good rest.

226
00:16:37,409 --> 00:16:49,000
Okay then, remember to eat on time. I'll come and see you after work tomorrow.

227
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Me and Kestin are both good kids.

228
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,639
Could it be that fate hasn't dealt the card?

229
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,639
Kestin, thanks for visiting my grandma. She's walking on air now.

230
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,569
She sure knows how to put on a show.

231
00:17:04,569 --> 00:17:11,789
Just remember to not back out at the divorce this time.

232
00:17:11,789 --> 00:17:20,000
You have my word.

233
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Grandma, why switch to the regular word and let go of the caregiver Kestin's grandma arranged for you?

234
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,180
I don't want to waste the money.

235
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:34,619
What should you talk about with Kestin yesterday?

236
00:17:34,619 --> 00:17:39,619
Jenny, if you decide to get divorced, go ahead. I'm backing you up.

237
00:17:39,619 --> 00:17:44,990
Look, Kestin is just tied up with work. We're fine.

238
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:50,990
When I asked you to marry Kestin, I thought he was someone you could entrust your whole life to.

239
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:57,990
I want you to have a complete and happy family and someone who loves and protects you on behalf of me.

240
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:59,990
Grandma, I understand.

241
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:06,990
No, no, you don't, you don't. You marry because of me and try to sustain this broken marriage for my sake.

242
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:12,990
That isn't what I wanted. I have only one wish and that's for you to be happy.

243
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:17,990
If this marriage brings you nothing but pains and stress, why hold on to it?

244
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:19,990
Grandma, you really think so?

245
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:22,500
I'll Kestin now.

246
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,500
Set a time to go through the divorce proceedings.

247
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:33,579
Kestin, I can proceed with the divorce now. When do you think we should do it?

248
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:41,220
Miss White, do all the documents and I hope you'll be on time this time.

249
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:52,339
Grandma, take a rest. Come even need anything. I'm going to get back to get the marriage license.

250
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:58,339
Madam, your grandson-in-law looks like a one-in-a-million man. Is it in a shame to just let him go like that?

251
00:18:58,339 --> 00:19:03,529
However true that is, Ginny's happiness is what matters most.

252
00:19:03,529 --> 00:19:23,569
Ginny?

253
00:19:23,569 --> 00:19:32,670
Grandma agreed to my divorce. I can now get at the divorce. Help me find the marriage license.

254
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:35,670
Absolutely. We're going to turn over every rock that we have to.

255
00:19:35,670 --> 00:20:06,380
Kestin Miller. Kestin Miller.

256
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:12,380
Same last name as my flawless boss, Alice Miller, but the two are worlds apart.

257
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:16,089
When will you go for the proceedings?

258
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:19,089
We'll come along with you and play a festive song then.

259
00:20:19,089 --> 00:20:25,089
It's a divorce. Let's keep it low key, but I'll treat you guys to a feast in advance to celebrate my divorce.

260
00:20:25,089 --> 00:20:26,089
Thank you.

261
00:20:26,089 --> 00:20:30,549
Ginny, what are you so excited about?

262
00:20:30,549 --> 00:20:32,779
Isn't it obvious?

263
00:20:32,779 --> 00:20:35,319
It's got a big carried away and ain't too much.

264
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:37,319
You're not pregnant, are you?

265
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:41,859
It's one of three best things in life.

266
00:20:41,859 --> 00:20:51,250
Mr. Miller, I have something to attend to this afternoon and I need to ask for a half day off.

267
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,250
Look at that happy face. She really pregnant?

268
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:57,049
Both of you can take the afternoon off.

269
00:20:57,049 --> 00:21:00,049
Mr. Miller, extra leave for us again?

270
00:21:00,049 --> 00:21:01,049
Any objections?

271
00:21:01,049 --> 00:21:06,089
No, not at all.

272
00:21:06,089 --> 00:21:09,089
Alice, your wife seems to be really excited this time.

273
00:21:09,089 --> 00:21:14,099
Why is Ginny here?

274
00:21:14,099 --> 00:21:16,099
Your wife is really out of this world.

275
00:21:16,099 --> 00:21:22,339
Even that stereotypical outfit is not going to hide her beauty.

276
00:21:22,339 --> 00:21:26,339
It's a pity that the man who owns her is not you, but another guy.

277
00:21:26,339 --> 00:21:28,339
What are you saying?

278
00:21:28,339 --> 00:21:31,339
Is it that woman in the business to her at the entrance is my wife?

279
00:21:31,339 --> 00:21:34,339
You're not going to tell me you don't even recognize your own wife.

280
00:21:34,339 --> 00:21:35,339
Are you?

281
00:21:35,339 --> 00:21:39,130
Ginny White? It's her.

282
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:42,740
I can't believe that I never had any doubts.

283
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:48,049
Doesn't she know that I am Keston and Alice?

284
00:21:48,049 --> 00:21:54,019
We've been wrong all this time along.

285
00:21:54,019 --> 00:21:57,819
What if this call goes out and it's not Ginny answers?

286
00:21:57,819 --> 00:21:59,819
What are you waiting for? Make the call.

287
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:00,819
Pick up the phone.

288
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:03,259
Pick up the phone, please.

289
00:22:03,259 --> 00:22:06,660
Ginny.

290
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:09,660
Keston, I'm here. Where are you guys?

291
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:14,990
It's really her.

292
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:19,250
Oh my god, so Ginny White is my lawful spouse.

293
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:28,170
And who can rightfully claim her, no matter who she has in her heart,

294
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:32,170
or whose child she cares, it can't change the fact that she is my wife.

295
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:35,170
Alice, what's wrong with you? Get out of the car!

296
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:38,549
No, I'm not getting a divorce anymore.

297
00:22:38,549 --> 00:22:41,099
Are you guys kidding me?

298
00:22:41,099 --> 00:22:44,099
She backed out of it last time and it's your turn now.

299
00:22:44,099 --> 00:22:45,099
Tell her my decision.

300
00:22:45,099 --> 00:22:47,349
I just go.

301
00:22:47,349 --> 00:22:57,779
Mr. Burgess, where's Keston?

302
00:22:57,779 --> 00:23:03,130
Sorry, Miss White. Keston said he doesn't want to go through with this divorce.

303
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:05,859
Are you guys kidding me?

304
00:23:06,859 --> 00:23:10,930
Miss White, you both had your turns. It evens out now.

305
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:15,500
Is this some kind of game to you? Is the voice a joke?

306
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:22,140
Why don't you go back first? I'll let you know when he changes his mind.

307
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:25,210
It was my fault that I missed the appointment the other day.

308
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:28,210
And you guys canceled it today, so let's call it even.

309
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:32,210
Why don't we schedule another date, tomorrow or the day after tomorrow?

310
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:35,210
It depends on Keston's mood.

311
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:39,779
He's the one who asked for the divorce, and now he's backing out of it.

312
00:23:39,779 --> 00:23:41,779
What's wrong with him?

313
00:23:41,779 --> 00:23:46,059
You're right, there is something wrong with him.

314
00:23:46,059 --> 00:23:49,059
Miss White, why don't you leave him alone?

315
00:23:49,059 --> 00:23:51,059
Your marriage has always been a castle in the air.

316
00:23:51,059 --> 00:23:54,059
Why don't you just start over with another guy?

317
00:23:54,059 --> 00:24:03,400
Why the long face? You know she has a boyfriend.

318
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,589
Let me ask you this.

319
00:24:05,589 --> 00:24:08,589
What are the three best things in a woman's life?

320
00:24:08,589 --> 00:24:14,779
Promotions, salary increase, and the demise of her husband.

321
00:24:14,779 --> 00:24:21,839
Oh, Jenny was so happy this morning because she was divorcing me.

322
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:26,400
Keston's really sick.

323
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,400
He's the one who cried for divorce, and now he's going to go back for it.

324
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,400
Does he think marriage is a game?

325
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:38,109
You know how to drive, don't drive.

326
00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:39,109
Mr. Miller.

327
00:24:39,109 --> 00:24:46,849
Just passing by. Happy at work.

328
00:24:46,849 --> 00:24:49,839
And pissed off on your break.

329
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:52,839
Mr. Miller, excuse me if there's nothing else.

330
00:24:52,839 --> 00:24:55,259
I'll give you a ride.

331
00:24:55,259 --> 00:25:14,140
Thank you, Mr. Miller. I'll head home now unless there's anything else you need.

332
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:17,140
Is it possible that she hasn't found out where marriage is like me?

333
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:20,140
Or maybe she knows everything or refused to accept me because she found another guy?

334
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:22,140
Mr. Miller, please stop acting like this.

335
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,140
Who the hell am I to?

336
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:25,529
Mr. Miller, you're on my boss.

337
00:25:26,529 --> 00:25:32,299
And?

338
00:25:32,299 --> 00:25:35,500
Nothing.

339
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:41,400
See you then.

340
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,400
Prom was Mr. Miller today, something's not right.

341
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:54,559
Mr. Miller, here's everything you asked about Jenny.

342
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:56,559
Ms. White had a tough time over the years.

343
00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:01,559
Her father passed away when she was five, and she was almost raped by her neighbor who covered her during her sophomore year.

344
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:06,619
The guy then planted the blame on Ms. White for introducing him in the first place.

345
00:26:06,619 --> 00:26:09,619
What about her uncle and aunt who had been bullying her?

346
00:26:09,619 --> 00:26:12,619
Ms. White has sent them both to prison. They'll be stuck in there for a whole week, the most.

347
00:26:14,259 --> 00:26:18,259
Find a way to have these bastards detained there for the rest of her lives. You understand?

348
00:26:18,259 --> 00:26:22,720
I got it, Mr. Miller.

349
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,720
What about the man who almost raped her in the past?

350
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:29,779
He's from a small family of M.C. City. Mr. Miller, do you want?

351
00:26:29,779 --> 00:26:32,779
This man doesn't need to exist.

352
00:26:32,779 --> 00:26:35,130
Got it. Consider it done.

353
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:48,529
Because of these things you don't believe in love anymore, right?

354
00:26:48,529 --> 00:26:51,529
That's why you married me following our grandmother's advice.

355
00:26:51,529 --> 00:27:02,720
Find me the best doctors from all over the world.

356
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,779
Now, I need to find the best treatment for Ginny's grandma.

357
00:27:06,779 --> 00:27:07,779
Okay?

358
00:27:07,779 --> 00:27:13,839
Hi, grandma.

359
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:14,839
What are you doing here?

360
00:27:14,839 --> 00:27:19,869
Have you come to see me hit the roof over your divorce?

361
00:27:19,869 --> 00:27:21,869
Huh? Is that what it is?

362
00:27:21,869 --> 00:27:26,990
I'm not getting a divorce. Ginny can only be my wife.

363
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:30,819
What did you say? You are not lying to me.

364
00:27:30,819 --> 00:27:37,619
You're right. Ginny is a nice girl, and I had some misunderstanding about her before.

365
00:27:37,619 --> 00:27:42,619
Now, I want to protect her and live the rest of my life with her.

366
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:47,160
Alice, is this all true?

367
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:50,160
But she doesn't want to be with me.

368
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:53,160
What do you want me to do? I've got to make this straight up front.

369
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,160
There's nothing much I can help you with.

370
00:27:55,160 --> 00:28:00,799
It's your wife, and you've got to win her over yourself.

371
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:11,500
Grandma, what? Ginny, the divorce thing didn't go well?

372
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:15,740
He's been walking back on it.

373
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:20,740
But don't worry, Grandma. Whether he divorces or not, it won't affect our lives.

374
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:24,740
Did he say why he's not divorcing? Something must have happened.

375
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,740
No, he didn't say any reason.

376
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:33,740
Oh, Ginny, even though we're not locals of New York City, and you don't have your parents to back you up.

377
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:39,869
As long as I'm still breathing, I won't let Kristen take advantage of you.

378
00:28:39,869 --> 00:28:45,859
Ah, no. I'm going to ask for an exclamation from Kristen's grandma.

379
00:28:45,859 --> 00:28:49,859
She don't on her grandson, and you are also the apple in my eye.

380
00:28:49,859 --> 00:28:54,859
Moses, you're right. I am going to give you and Ginny an explanation.

381
00:28:54,859 --> 00:28:58,859
What Kesta did was just out of line.

382
00:28:58,859 --> 00:29:03,859
He was the one who wanted the divorce in the first place, and now he's backing out.

383
00:29:03,859 --> 00:29:05,859
What does he think Ginny is?

384
00:29:05,859 --> 00:29:13,799
If he dares to show up in front of me again,

385
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:16,799
I'll break his legs. I'm fed up with it.

386
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:20,369
I just can't take this anymore.

387
00:29:20,369 --> 00:29:25,369
Jane, take it easy. You want some water? Easy, don't do it.

388
00:29:25,369 --> 00:29:32,880
Moses, I know you're soft-hearted. You're so soft-hearted.

389
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:46,809
But I can't take advantage of your kindness and just let this go.

390
00:29:46,809 --> 00:29:50,809
It's not possible. I mean, with what he's done.

391
00:29:50,809 --> 00:29:53,809
Pack up and come with me to South Mountain Manor.

392
00:29:53,809 --> 00:29:58,809
You can rest off there and let's blow that brass money.

393
00:29:58,809 --> 00:30:02,279
Let's blow that brass money.

394
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:05,279
Grandma, Jane, I can't afford my grandma's medicine bills.

395
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,279
We can spare keys since money.

396
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:14,549
No. Ginny, you need to wrap your head around this.

397
00:30:14,549 --> 00:30:19,549
As long as that little rascal hasn't divorced you, your grandma is his grandma.

398
00:30:19,549 --> 00:30:23,549
And he's entitled to spend his money.

399
00:30:23,549 --> 00:30:27,549
He must pay the price for his unruly behavior.

400
00:30:27,549 --> 00:30:29,549
Grandma, what do you think?

401
00:30:29,549 --> 00:30:31,549
Ginny, I think Jane has a point.

402
00:30:31,549 --> 00:30:34,549
I'm going to go with her to South Mountain Manor.

403
00:30:34,549 --> 00:30:37,549
No, Grandma, calm down. This is huge.

404
00:30:37,549 --> 00:30:39,549
We have a serious- Calm down.

405
00:30:39,549 --> 00:30:40,549
Calm down.

406
00:30:40,549 --> 00:30:47,839
How on earth am I supposed to calm down when Keston is getting on my nurse?

407
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:52,660
Actually, Keston is a nice boy.

408
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:55,660
It's just that you can't force things like marriage.

409
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:58,660
He's nice. What's so nice about him?

410
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:04,660
He's 28 years old, and he's never been in love, nor does he play around.

411
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:09,589
Then finally, he listened to me to get married.

412
00:31:09,589 --> 00:31:12,589
Then he messed the whole thing up.

413
00:31:12,589 --> 00:31:14,690
That sounds like a compliment.

414
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:18,779
No. It's not as bad as you make it out to be.

415
00:31:18,779 --> 00:31:24,480
Come Ginny, we're going to South Mountain.

416
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:32,660
Grandma, Keston has hired us caregivers who are better at taking care of people than you.

417
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:34,660
Hurry back to your work.

418
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:38,660
Then you two take care of yourself, helping by when I have time.

419
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:43,660
You're a young girl. Go date or something. Don't dwell on us.

420
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:47,660
Leave us alone. You deserve to have a life.

421
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:50,660
Come on. How does a married woman go on dating?

422
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:53,660
I don't want to take the blame for cheating.

423
00:31:53,660 --> 00:32:09,210
Hey Ginny, my shoes got dirty.

424
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:13,769
Come wipe them for me.

425
00:32:13,769 --> 00:32:16,769
Olivia, why would I do that?

426
00:32:16,769 --> 00:32:18,769
I'm not a major client of your company.

427
00:32:18,769 --> 00:32:23,769
Even if you are a big shot customer, it's not my job to wipe your shoes.

428
00:32:23,769 --> 00:32:25,769
Alice should be divorced by now.

429
00:32:25,769 --> 00:32:30,440
So, I'll be the wife of your boss down the road.

430
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:33,440
It's your opportunity to wipe my shoes.

431
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,539
Don't make me fire you.

432
00:32:35,539 --> 00:32:37,539
Big news.

433
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:41,539
Miss Miller said he wasn't getting divorced and bought a giant diamond ring for his wife,

434
00:32:41,539 --> 00:32:44,539
which is worth at least $30 million.

435
00:32:44,539 --> 00:32:46,539
Wow, $30 million?

436
00:32:46,539 --> 00:32:49,569
The president surely loves his wife dearly.

437
00:32:49,569 --> 00:32:58,109
Who was dreaming of Mary and the president?

438
00:32:58,109 --> 00:33:01,400
Why is Alice still dragging about the divorce?

439
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,400
There's shameless bitches of slop from the slums.

440
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:09,759
What trick did she use on Alice?

441
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:11,759
She's squaring off with me now.

442
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:15,890
I miss with Alice's wife, but for sure I can make you suffer, bitch.

443
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:19,420
We've got a problem.

444
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:21,779
What's going on?

445
00:33:21,779 --> 00:33:27,220
The ring I put in the safe for the Mrs. is missing.

446
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:32,349
Someone must have stolen it.

447
00:33:32,349 --> 00:33:34,349
Why me is my privacy?

448
00:33:34,349 --> 00:33:39,680
Did you press out? I need a surgeon.

449
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,809
How could it be my purse?

450
00:33:41,809 --> 00:33:42,809
How could it?

451
00:33:42,809 --> 00:33:44,809
Because I couldn't do it myself.

452
00:33:44,809 --> 00:33:48,789
I found it!

453
00:33:48,789 --> 00:33:50,789
You bitchin' daze?

454
00:33:50,789 --> 00:33:52,789
Come with me to the police station right now.

455
00:33:52,789 --> 00:33:53,980
What are you doing?

456
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:55,980
This little bitch stole the ring you bought for your wife.

457
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:58,980
What are you talking about? I wouldn't do that.

458
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:03,660
It's something you can't afford in your lifetime, so of course you've covered it.

459
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:07,779
She didn't need to steal it. The ring was bought for her.

460
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:11,489
How so? Isn't this meant to be given to your wife?

461
00:34:11,489 --> 00:34:14,489
Yes. Jenny White is my wife.

462
00:34:14,489 --> 00:34:19,389
What?

463
00:34:19,389 --> 00:34:22,389
On the contrary, you are the person who set her up.

464
00:34:22,389 --> 00:34:25,389
I've asked security to pull up the surveillance.

465
00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:33,130
You're going to jail. Security!

466
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:35,130
Mr. Miller, did you make a mistake?

467
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:41,269
No. Jenny. I'm Jane's grandson.

468
00:34:41,269 --> 00:34:47,099
Kestin Miller. The one who married you.

469
00:34:47,099 --> 00:34:52,480
How is it you? Our marriage was arranged by our grandmothers.

470
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:59,300
Mr. Miller, you don't have to accept it, and if you back out now, I'll agree.

471
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,400
I'm only afraid that you'll back out.

472
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:05,400
I love you not because you're my wife, but because you are who you are.

473
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:43,530
I still owe you the proposal. So, Jenny, will you marry me?

474
00:35:43,530 --> 00:37:09,730
I do. You scare me again.

475
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:13,340
Seems you were tired last night. Why didn't you continue?

476
00:37:13,340 --> 00:38:04,730
Come on, we have a meeting in the morning, honey. Go over.

477
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:07,860
Where's the diamond ring I gave you? Why aren't you wearing it?

478
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:13,860
It's $3 million. What if I drop it? Can I buy a super expensive safe and lock it inside?

479
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:19,349
You're happy I'll buy you another one if you drop it.

480
00:38:19,349 --> 00:38:32,400
Give me another ten if I lose it.

481
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,659
Grandma's what are you doing?

482
00:38:34,659 --> 00:38:38,659
It's one year into your marriage, and you're still not pregnant.

483
00:38:38,659 --> 00:38:40,750
We're concerned.

484
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:44,750
You're not shooting blanks, are you, grandson?

485
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:50,750
I was shopping for medication online for you last night.

486
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:52,750
What are you talking about, Grandma?

487
00:38:52,750 --> 00:39:03,269
This family is welcoming a new member!

488
00:39:03,269 --> 00:39:09,920
Oh, this is wonderful news.

489
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:15,070
Oh, finally have a grandchild.
