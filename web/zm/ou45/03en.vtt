You know what? Just because you're good-looking doesn't mean every woman wants you in her bed.

2
00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.239
Trust me. History says otherwise.

3
00:00:17.239 --> 00:00:18.370
Oh, really?

4
00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:23.370
Well, I'm not that. And you should apologize.

5
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:29.059
You knew here? Never seen you before.

6
00:00:29.059 --> 00:00:34.060
Well, if you must know, I'm here for an interview with the president. Robert Kensington?

7
00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.250
Yeah, sure. He's way less of a tool than you are.

8
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.250
Yeah, I hear great things about him.

9
00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.390
By the way, your clone smells disgusting.

10
00:00:43.390 --> 00:01:02.500
Clone is $475. Smell great.

11
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.599
Thank you. Mr. Kensington, welcome back.

12
00:01:05.599 --> 00:01:08.599
Our favorite president is here.
