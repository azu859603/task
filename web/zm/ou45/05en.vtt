Mr. Kensington, hello, excuse me. Mr. Kensington, these are the two candidates that we have

2
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:27.480
today for your personal assistant position. Mr. Kensington, first of all, it is an honor

3
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.520
to be here. I come with experience. I'm qualified in addition to having a sparkling

4
00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.520
recommendation from our Vice President, Mr. Marcus Carter. More of a

5
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:44.509
disadvantage, really. My cousin rarely has good instincts. And I'm so fee. We've

6
00:00:44.509 --> 00:00:49.990
already gotten to know each other in bed. Yes. Yeah, and I like to apologize. I feel

7
00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:55.939
like I overstepped and maybe I have no shot at this so I should just go. You're

8
00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:59.490
hurt. What?
