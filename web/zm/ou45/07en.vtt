00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.810
How did she get there?

2
00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:03.109
No, I don't know how it happened.

3
00:00:03.109 --> 00:00:06.639
He just hired her as his new assistant.

4
00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:09.000
Don't panic, Marcus.

5
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.699
The main task remains the same.

6
00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:16.339
We need to get them officially divorced.

7
00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:18.239
Mom, this is ridiculous. Where is she?

8
00:00:18.239 --> 00:00:21.879
Don't worry, Robert. She is coming.

9
00:00:21.879 --> 00:00:23.519
I'm leaving.

10
00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.019
Rosie, Rosie, I'm here. I'm here.

11
00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:27.019
I'm sorry, I'm late.

12
00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:28.420
I'm so sorry, my dear.

13
00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:29.920
He already left.

14
00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.320
So the wedding's canceled?

15
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.850
Not quite.

16
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.649
Sign here, and you'll be his wife.

17
00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:38.850
Rosie, are you suggesting that we get married blind?

18
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.450
You'll always be like a daughter to me.

19
00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.619
But unfortunately, your father owes us a great deal of money.

20
00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:49.520
So I'm afraid you have no choice.
