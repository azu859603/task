1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
But does he know about that condition?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,129
No, because I never showed him the contract.

3
00:00:05,129 --> 00:00:09,130
Your job is to get him to fire her.

4
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:12,130
Don't allow them to develop any feelings.

5
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:14,130
Or fall in love.

6
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:15,380
I'll take it from there.

7
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:17,379
Understood?

8
00:00:17,379 --> 00:00:18,379
I love it.

9
00:00:18,379 --> 00:00:33,020
Can we get dinner tonight?

10
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:34,020
What are you doing?

11
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,020
You think you're so cool, huh?

12
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,469
You've been here for, what, two days?

13
00:00:38,469 --> 00:00:41,469
And you've already managed to get into Mr. Kensington's camp.

14
00:00:41,469 --> 00:00:44,530
Hey, that is not true.

15
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:48,530
I am watching your every move.

16
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:49,530
Yeah?

17
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:54,539
Is that a threat?

18
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:57,020
Sophie, come to my office.
