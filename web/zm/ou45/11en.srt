1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,150
I'd like it if you just signed the contract.

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:08,400
Okay, I'll sign.

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,400
Great.

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,400
If you kiss me.

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,500
What are you doing?

6
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,500
Stop pretending.

7
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,500
Stop it!

8
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:16,500
I gotta go.

9
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,500
What's up?

10
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,850
What's going on here?

11
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:21,359
You touching my assistant?

12
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:22,359
Robert, no.

13
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:23,359
Come on.

14
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:24,359
She came on to me.

15
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:25,359
I tried to stop her.

16
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,359
Bullshit!

17
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:28,359
He tried to kiss me.

18
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:31,149
Is that true?

19
00:00:31,149 --> 00:00:32,149
Robert.

20
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:36,429
Deals off.

21
00:00:36,429 --> 00:00:38,429
If you go in here again, you're dead.

22
00:00:38,429 --> 00:00:39,429
You understand me?

23
00:00:39,429 --> 00:00:49,490
I'm fine.

24
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:52,100
See you tomorrow at the office.

25
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,100
Lady, I'm sharp.

26
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,100
Don't be late.

27
00:00:54,100 --> 00:01:09,829
Rosie, what's going on?

28
00:01:09,829 --> 00:01:10,829
What?

29
00:01:10,829 --> 00:01:11,829
Yeah, yeah.

30
00:01:11,829 --> 00:01:15,530
Thank you, my dear.

31
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:20,049
Mmm.

32
00:01:20,049 --> 00:01:21,049
I'm so glad you came.

33
00:01:21,049 --> 00:01:22,049
Of course.

34
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:23,049
Of course.

35
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:25,180
Tell me what's going on.

36
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:30,489
I'm losing weight fast and the doctors don't know why.

37
00:01:30,489 --> 00:01:38,019
So I read on the internet that it's a symptom of cancer.

38
00:01:38,019 --> 00:01:39,340
Cancer?

39
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:41,260
What can I do?

40
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:45,319
Oh, tell me what I can do anything.

41
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:51,459
Before I die, I have one request.

42
00:01:51,459 --> 00:01:52,459
Meet my son.

43
00:01:52,459 --> 00:02:01,879
Oh, you rest.

44
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:03,420
Thank you, my dear.

45
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,680
All right, I'll be back soon.

46
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:30,810
Mom, you sit on the phone.

47
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:31,810
You were sick.

48
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:32,810
Why are you drinking?

49
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:33,810
I didn't hear you come in, dear.

50
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:37,810
The doctor said one glass of white wine can actually easily discomfort.

51
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:40,509
Okay, so what happened?

52
00:02:40,509 --> 00:02:42,509
I just feel so bad.

53
00:02:42,509 --> 00:02:44,509
You haven't met your wife yet.

54
00:02:44,509 --> 00:02:45,669
Well, I'm busy.

55
00:02:45,669 --> 00:02:46,669
I told you that.

56
00:02:46,669 --> 00:02:48,669
Please do it for me.

57
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:52,800
I promised your father that we would take care of his daughter.

58
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,659
The family got the money, right?

59
00:02:55,659 --> 00:02:56,659
Do they want more?

60
00:02:56,659 --> 00:02:57,659
Is that what this is about?

61
00:02:57,659 --> 00:02:58,659
We can give them more.

62
00:02:58,659 --> 00:03:01,659
Money is just a cold, hard number, Robert.

63
00:03:01,659 --> 00:03:04,819
Yeah, you give her the warmth of family.

64
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:12,439
Just meet her at the Boulevard Hotel tonight.

65
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:14,439
And if you don't like her, you can divorce her.

66
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,110
Deal?

67
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:36,289
69.

68
00:03:36,289 --> 00:04:26,089
Be kidding me.

69
00:04:26,089 --> 00:04:39,629
It's done.

70
00:04:39,629 --> 00:04:40,819
Fucking relief.

71
00:04:40,819 --> 00:04:53,149
Hello, dear.

72
00:04:53,149 --> 00:04:57,389
Um, he's about here.

73
00:04:57,389 --> 00:04:59,420
I'm so sorry, my dear.

74
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:01,420
I really, really thought.

75
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,699
It's okay.

76
00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:08,180
Just, uh, just wasn't meant to be.

77
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:33,379
So he didn't show up.

78
00:05:33,379 --> 00:05:34,790
Again.

79
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:37,790
Men, you see this is why I don't date.

80
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:40,790
Okay, how long until your father's debts are paid off?

81
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:41,790
Oh, I don't know.

82
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:42,790
Rosie handles all that stuff.

83
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:43,790
Okay.

84
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:47,790
I know I've said this before, but I think it's strange that she set you up with her son,

85
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:48,790
who you've never met.

86
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:52,790
And she's also handling these debts, which you've also never seen in their full detail.

87
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:55,889
You know she's like a mother to me, okay?

88
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:57,889
I trust her with my life.

89
00:05:57,889 --> 00:05:59,300
I know.

90
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,300
He better be rich and tall, okay?

91
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,300
If so, you better find out if he swings both ways.

92
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,850
Oh.

93
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:10,170
He is so angry today.

94
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:13,170
I think he found his wife cheating on him last night.

95
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:17,160
Wait, but he's married?

96
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,160
Look at these nails.

97
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,160
Do you see them?

98
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,160
He said that these are not workplace blue.

99
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,160
What kind of common is that?

100
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,160
Blue?

101
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,060
What is wrong with him?

102
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:31,939
Do I pay you two to chitchat?

103
00:06:31,939 --> 00:06:32,939
No, sir.

104
00:06:32,939 --> 00:06:34,939
We were just talking about paper work.

105
00:06:34,939 --> 00:06:38,699
Yes.

106
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:40,699
Very angry.

107
00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:47,660
Now, I love my job.

108
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:48,660
I love my job.

109
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:49,720
I love my job.

110
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:55,329
Hi, Sophie.

111
00:06:55,329 --> 00:06:58,709
This is Kevin Todd, your husband's divorce attorney.

112
00:06:58,709 --> 00:06:59,709
Divorce lawyer.

113
00:06:59,709 --> 00:07:01,709
Why does he want a divorce?

114
00:07:01,709 --> 00:07:02,709
Why don't we talk when we meet?

115
00:07:02,709 --> 00:07:05,709
How's Pine Tree Cafe 4pm?

116
00:07:05,709 --> 00:07:07,129
Okay, yeah, yeah.

117
00:07:07,129 --> 00:07:08,129
I'll be there.

118
00:07:08,129 --> 00:07:21,319
Sophie.

119
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:23,800
I guess we should get right into it.

120
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,800
Sure.

121
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,149
Hear the divorce papers?

122
00:07:27,149 --> 00:07:30,149
Read them carefully and we can discuss.

123
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:47,250
See, out of his mind, he wants me to pay 30 million in moral damages?

124
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:53,850
Keep reading.

125
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:56,850
On the grounds of deception, I've never even seen him.

126
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:58,850
He should pay me for walking out of the wedding.

127
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:01,850
Hey, inside voices, let's keep it polite.

128
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:08,220
I'll talk to him and have him take that part out, but how soon can you agree to the divorce?

129
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,220
In an instant.

130
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:11,149
Okay.

131
00:08:11,149 --> 00:08:16,930
I'll let him know.

132
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:21,930
Hey, she won't agree to the moral damages, but she will agree to the divorce immediately.

133
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:24,819
Okay?

134
00:08:24,819 --> 00:08:27,350
He agrees.

135
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:38,659
Sophie, where the hell are you?

136
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:39,659
I need you here.

137
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:41,980
I can't find Nick anywhere.

138
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:42,980
Hurry up.

139
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:43,980
I know.

140
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:44,980
I'm sorry.

141
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:45,980
I'm coming back right now.

142
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:46,980
I'm sorry.

143
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:52,269
Look, I really have to go, but I will talk to you soon.

144
00:08:52,269 --> 00:09:03,480
We have an issue.

145
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:10,629
Sir, you were looking for me?

146
00:09:10,629 --> 00:09:13,210
Yeah, I need my lunch.

147
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:17,169
Looks like Nick went to the fucking nail salon.

148
00:09:17,169 --> 00:09:19,169
I'll go get that right now.

149
00:09:19,169 --> 00:09:26,220
Sophie.

150
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,220
Hi.

151
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:32,200
I never congratulated you on your new position.

152
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,200
Welcome to the family.

153
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,289
Thanks.

154
00:09:35,289 --> 00:09:37,480
I'm happy to be here.

155
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:41,659
I'm just going to get Robert's lunch.

156
00:09:41,659 --> 00:09:46,080
Oh, actually, it's just one.

157
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,070
He gets the same thing every day.

158
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:50,070
Okay.

159
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:51,809
Yeah.

160
00:09:51,809 --> 00:09:52,809
Thanks.

161
00:09:52,809 --> 00:09:53,809
I'm going to go play this then.

162
00:09:53,809 --> 00:09:54,809
Oh, yeah.

163
00:09:54,809 --> 00:09:55,899
Have a nice day.

164
00:09:55,899 --> 00:09:56,899
Hey, YouTube.

165
00:09:56,899 --> 00:10:11,169
Here's your lunch, Mr. Kensington.

166
00:10:11,169 --> 00:10:18,700
Sorry.

167
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:28,019
Would you like a water soda or something?

168
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:29,399
This tastes different.

169
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:31,909
This isn't Popeyes, is it?

170
00:10:31,909 --> 00:10:32,909
Oh, no.

171
00:10:32,909 --> 00:10:34,549
It's day of sale.

172
00:10:34,549 --> 00:10:36,639
Hmm.

173
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:37,960
What?

174
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,960
Is everything okay?

175
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:44,940
Mr. Kensington?

176
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:47,639
Mr. Kensington.

177
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:48,639
Mr. Kensington.

178
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:51,179
Hey, somebody help.

179
00:10:51,179 --> 00:10:52,179
Mr. Kensington, wake up.

180
00:10:52,179 --> 00:11:02,909
Good news is we pumped his stomach just in time and got it all out of his system.

181
00:11:02,909 --> 00:11:04,940
He's going to be okay.

182
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,940
Do we know what happened?

183
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,940
He just passed out.

184
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:13,259
Well, Robert has a very severe peanut allergy.

185
00:11:13,259 --> 00:11:14,549
Oh.

186
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:16,549
I didn't know that he didn't tell me.

187
00:11:16,549 --> 00:11:21,049
I've been his doctor for years, so he must not have known what was in his food or what

188
00:11:21,049 --> 00:11:24,549
he was eating because he would have never eaten it.

189
00:11:24,549 --> 00:11:28,549
But he has the same thing for lunch every day, so I don't know how possible.

190
00:11:28,549 --> 00:11:30,549
I need to have an investigation.

191
00:11:30,549 --> 00:11:32,350
Hey, sleepyhead.

192
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:34,350
Mr. President, you're awake.

193
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:44,870
When can he be discharged?

194
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:48,870
I need at least 24 to 48 hours, Robert.

195
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:51,419
Doc, you know me, I'm fine.

196
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:52,419
Uh-uh.

197
00:11:52,419 --> 00:11:53,419
You heard her.

198
00:11:53,419 --> 00:11:55,419
I don't strain yourself.

199
00:11:55,419 --> 00:12:02,980
I have to take this, but I'll be right back.

200
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:08,470
Hey, Kevin, what's up?

201
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:11,470
Sophie, when can you come sign these papers?

202
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:12,470
You're rushed out of the cafe.

203
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:13,470
I know.

204
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:14,470
I know.

205
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:15,470
I'm sorry.

206
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:16,470
I will.

207
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:17,470
I just need 48 hours.

208
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,470
I'm dealing with an emergency.

209
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:30,419
48 hours?

210
00:12:30,419 --> 00:12:32,419
She wants 48 hours.

211
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:33,419
48 hours?

212
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:34,419
Yeah.

213
00:12:34,419 --> 00:12:35,509
Okay.

214
00:12:35,509 --> 00:12:36,509
Fine.

215
00:12:36,509 --> 00:12:37,509
48 hours?

216
00:12:37,509 --> 00:12:38,509
No more.

217
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:42,070
Who are you talking to?

218
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:46,909
My friend.

219
00:12:49,909 --> 00:12:50,909
What kind of trouble?

220
00:12:50,909 --> 00:12:52,909
Maybe I can help.

221
00:12:52,909 --> 00:12:55,940
His mom forced him to marry someone.

222
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:59,320
An arranged marriage.

223
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,629
Totally get it.

224
00:13:02,629 --> 00:13:04,759
Totally understand his pain.

225
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:05,759
It's terrible.

226
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:06,759
You do?

227
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:07,759
Yeah.

228
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:08,759
Yeah.

229
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:11,460
Complicated, but I do.

230
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:14,500
My friend thinks the same thing.

231
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,879
So what's he going to do about it?

232
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:20,320
He wants a divorce.

233
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:25,370
They were going to make a deal, but got her cheating.

234
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:32,100
What's her side of the story?

235
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,000
Like on her cheating.

236
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Who cares?

237
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
So it is you.

238
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,149
Well, to be fair, Nick told me, but...

239
00:13:41,149 --> 00:13:43,340
Of course.

240
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:47,730
Only tell Nick when you want the whole world to know.

241
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:48,730
Oh.

242
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:49,730
We love him for it.

243
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:53,870
But I completely understand.

244
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,379
Really?

245
00:13:55,379 --> 00:13:57,059
Yeah.

246
00:13:57,059 --> 00:14:02,730
My friend is also in an arranged marriage.

247
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:05,730
Except they've never even met because he didn't shop to the wedding.

248
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:09,620
Wow.

249
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:12,620
That guy is a worthless piece of shit.

250
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:18,240
Your friend should be able to divorce him piece.

251
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,529
Thank you for listening.

252
00:14:20,529 --> 00:14:21,529
No, thank you.

253
00:14:21,529 --> 00:14:26,129
It actually helped to talk about him.

254
00:14:26,129 --> 00:14:39,200
Let me get you some water.

255
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,200
Sophie, why don't you stay with me until I'm discharged?

256
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,200
I'll pay you three times your hourly rate.

257
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,200
Absolutely not.

258
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,389
Why?

259
00:14:46,389 --> 00:14:48,389
Do you not want to be around me?

260
00:14:48,389 --> 00:14:49,389
Oh, no, no.

261
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:50,389
It's not that.

262
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,389
I'm objecting to the rays in my rate.

263
00:14:52,389 --> 00:14:54,389
I'm just here doing my job.

264
00:14:54,389 --> 00:14:56,710
I do have a favorite asking you.

265
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:58,940
Anything for you, sir?

266
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,669
Yes.

267
00:15:01,669 --> 00:15:04,789
Right there.

268
00:15:04,789 --> 00:15:05,789
Oh, yeah.

269
00:15:05,789 --> 00:15:08,460
I feel so good.

270
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:11,299
Oh, my God.

271
00:15:11,299 --> 00:15:15,769
Should we close the door so that nobody sees?

272
00:15:15,769 --> 00:15:16,769
It's okay.

273
00:15:16,769 --> 00:15:17,769
It's just lotion.

274
00:15:17,769 --> 00:15:19,769
Yeah, the allergic reaction gave him a rash.

275
00:15:19,769 --> 00:15:21,769
That you decided to scratch.

276
00:15:21,769 --> 00:15:22,769
Why?

277
00:15:22,769 --> 00:15:23,769
What happened?

278
00:15:23,769 --> 00:15:24,769
Nothing.

279
00:15:24,769 --> 00:15:25,769
Nothing.

280
00:15:25,769 --> 00:15:27,769
I wanted to make sure that you were okay.

281
00:15:27,769 --> 00:15:28,769
And, sir?

282
00:15:28,769 --> 00:15:32,070
Okay.

283
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:35,610
He is so weird.

284
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:48,120
One more signature and you are divorced.

285
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,120
He wasn't happy that you needed this extra time.

286
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,220
Well, I'm not his toy.

287
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:56,850
He should have been a man and come to deal with it himself.

288
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:57,850
Okay.

289
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:00,850
I'll pass this along to him and get his signatures.

290
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:01,850
It'll be official.

291
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:12,490
What the hell is wrong with you?

292
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:14,490
I told you to separate them.

293
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:15,490
Not kill him.

294
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:17,490
I didn't know he'd be that allergic.

295
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:21,490
Do you realize this brought them closer together?

296
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:22,490
You.

297
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:28,799
Idiot.

298
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:31,210
Rosie, are you home?

299
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:32,210
Yes, dear.

300
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:33,299
Come on in.

301
00:16:33,299 --> 00:16:34,299
Hey.

302
00:16:34,299 --> 00:16:36,200
It's just you.

303
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,200
I thought I heard voices.

304
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,200
Must be the cat outside.

305
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,200
Always screaming.

306
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,419
I can't stay long.

307
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:48,700
But I wanted to let you know that I signed the divorce papers.

308
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:49,700
Oh.

309
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:52,460
I'm so sorry, my dear.

310
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,909
It's okay.

311
00:16:53,909 --> 00:16:57,299
Once your son signs them, it's over.

312
00:16:57,299 --> 00:17:00,190
I just promised me our relationship won't change.

313
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:02,190
Of course not, dear.

314
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:03,480
Come here.

315
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,480
Give me a hug.

316
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:10,390
I have to go, but I love you.

317
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:11,390
I love you too.

318
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:20,720
What the fuck do you say?

319
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,009
Can I believe my ears?

320
00:17:23,009 --> 00:17:24,009
Ugh.

321
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:26,039
That was some quick handiwork.

322
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:29,039
All you need to do now is get her fired.

323
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:38,380
Nick, who do you think is the best person to take over the Dragon Group deal?

324
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:42,380
Uh, well, Marcus and Hannah did a very good job on the presentation.

325
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,380
I prefer Sophie.

326
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:47,269
Of course you do.

327
00:17:47,269 --> 00:17:48,269
What's that supposed to mean?

328
00:17:48,269 --> 00:17:49,269
Nothing.

329
00:17:49,269 --> 00:17:52,579
You wanted to see me?

330
00:17:52,579 --> 00:17:55,710
Sophie, are you familiar with the Dragon Group deal?

331
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:56,710
Yeah.

332
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:57,710
Yeah.

333
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,710
I was told that it's potentially the biggest deal of the year.

334
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:01,099
That's right.

335
00:18:01,099 --> 00:18:03,099
And I want you to take it over.

336
00:18:03,099 --> 00:18:05,220
Me?

337
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,880
Oh.

338
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,880
Thank you.

339
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,880
Thank you for trusting me with it.

340
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,880
No.

341
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:21,039
Thank you.

342
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,259
Hello.

343
00:18:23,259 --> 00:18:25,259
Do you need anything else?

344
00:18:25,259 --> 00:18:31,059
I'm sure you'll do a great job.

345
00:18:31,059 --> 00:18:32,059
Sophie.

346
00:18:32,059 --> 00:18:35,380
What do you want, Hannah?

347
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:38,430
Dragon Group deal, huh?

348
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:40,430
You really did get into his pants.

349
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:41,430
Oh, please.

350
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:43,430
I earned it through my work.

351
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:44,819
Yeah.

352
00:18:44,819 --> 00:18:56,180
Through your work, we'll see how good you really are.

353
00:18:56,180 --> 00:19:00,130
You're here.

354
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:01,130
You're bold to come here.

355
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:04,130
I'm surprised they haven't fired you yet.

356
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:06,130
I don't know what you're talking about.

357
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:09,130
You didn't notice the three extra zeros in the Dragon Group contract?

358
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,480
Who do you group lost $10 billion because of it?

359
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,480
No.

360
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:26,630
No, I reviewed that contract over and over.

361
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:29,069
Where is it?

362
00:19:29,069 --> 00:19:35,819
Well, I heard what you did with the Dragon Group.

363
00:19:35,819 --> 00:19:37,079
Ooh.

364
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:38,079
Ouch.

365
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:39,079
I didn't do anything.

366
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:40,079
Okay?

367
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:41,079
It's a big misunderstanding.

368
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:43,269
I'm going to figure it out.

369
00:19:43,269 --> 00:19:48,269
Oh, you didn't do anything except cost this company billions?

370
00:19:48,269 --> 00:19:50,589
What exactly do you have against me?

371
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:52,589
What have I ever done to you?

372
00:19:52,589 --> 00:19:56,170
I just don't think unqualified people should be promoted.

373
00:19:56,170 --> 00:20:00,170
Especially not whores who sleep with the boss.

374
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:02,170
I beg your pardon?

375
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:03,200
How dare you?

376
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,200
Sophie.

377
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,220
Sophie, Sophie, Sophie.

378
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:13,339
Now, to this day, I still don't understand why my cousin hired you for this position.

379
00:20:13,339 --> 00:20:17,380
But as the vice president, I am going to have to fire you.

380
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:22,579
Well, that's interesting.

381
00:20:22,579 --> 00:20:27,789
Because as the vice president, you have no authority to fire people.

382
00:20:27,789 --> 00:20:29,819
Only the president does.

383
00:20:29,819 --> 00:20:30,819
And that's me.

384
00:20:30,819 --> 00:20:38,279
Now, everyone can stop gossiping and get back to work.

385
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:45,819
Robert, I think you're looking at this the wrong way.

386
00:20:45,819 --> 00:20:51,849
These losses are making us suffer greatly, and it's all her fault.

387
00:20:51,849 --> 00:20:56,029
Mr. Kensington, I have nothing to do with this.

388
00:20:56,029 --> 00:20:58,099
And being framed, I know it.

389
00:20:58,099 --> 00:21:01,099
You were the last one to see the contracts.

390
00:21:01,099 --> 00:21:05,690
How would you know that?

391
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:08,819
Well, Sophie, I will be taking this very seriously.

392
00:21:08,819 --> 00:21:10,819
But I won't need answers by tomorrow.

393
00:21:10,819 --> 00:21:14,160
I really didn't do this.

394
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,220
I believe you.

395
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:18,730
But I operate off evidence.

396
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:19,730
Not words.

397
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:22,740
Go!

398
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:42,480
I'd like to request the security footage from the office, husband.

399
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,470
What?

400
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:45,819
What do you mean by erased?

401
00:21:45,819 --> 00:21:47,940
Couldn't that be?

402
00:21:47,940 --> 00:22:03,230
I don't think we've been officially introduced.

403
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:05,230
My name is Nick Foster, the president's secretary.

404
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:06,259
Tara.

405
00:22:06,259 --> 00:22:07,259
Tara.

406
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:12,259
I have just been told that some of the surveillance footage from last night has gone missing.

407
00:22:12,259 --> 00:22:13,259
That's true.

408
00:22:13,259 --> 00:22:16,259
Well, who else has access to the footage?

409
00:22:16,259 --> 00:22:17,259
Just me.

410
00:22:17,259 --> 00:22:20,460
So no one else could have erased it.

411
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:25,690
I'm going to need you to tell me exactly what happened.

412
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:26,690
It was Hannah.

413
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:28,690
Well, that was easier than I expected.

414
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:30,980
She made you delete it?

415
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:34,230
Well, you can't necessarily delete it.

416
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:35,230
She has the footage.

417
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:37,230
Oh, really?

418
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,230
I'm sorry.

419
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:41,230
She was really aggressive, and you're not going to fire me, are you?

420
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:42,230
It's okay.

421
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:43,230
She's a bitch.

422
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:45,299
Let me take care of it.

423
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:52,099
Tara, what can you do for me?

424
00:22:52,099 --> 00:22:53,099
Your time, baby?

425
00:22:53,099 --> 00:22:54,099
You did great.

426
00:22:54,099 --> 00:22:57,460
He has no reason not to hire you for the position.

427
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:07,339
Well, let's save our celebration for after she gets fired.

428
00:23:07,339 --> 00:23:08,339
Wait a minute.

429
00:23:08,339 --> 00:23:11,039
Why do you always have to tease me like that?

430
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:12,039
Huh?

431
00:23:12,039 --> 00:23:13,039
Sorry to interrupt.

432
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:16,039
Hannah, is there something that you'd like to tell us?

433
00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:18,039
Um, no.

434
00:23:18,039 --> 00:23:20,039
Nothing about what happened last night?

435
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:22,039
I don't know what you're talking about.

436
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,039
You set me up.

437
00:23:24,039 --> 00:23:25,039
Set you up?

438
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:29,140
I couldn't even pretend to be as dumb as you are.

439
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:32,390
Can't fuck your way out of this one, Sophie.

440
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:33,839
You?

441
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:36,029
You're just really jealous of me.

442
00:23:36,029 --> 00:23:39,029
What's your obsession with my relationship with the president, huh?

443
00:23:39,029 --> 00:23:41,029
Do you have a crush on?

444
00:23:41,029 --> 00:23:42,670
What?

445
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:43,670
Do you?

446
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:44,670
No.

447
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:45,670
Just hand over the video.

448
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:46,740
You can't make me.

449
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:47,740
Uh-huh.

450
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:48,740
Bust it.

451
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,740
And now we take you to the president.

452
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:56,440
Whoa.
