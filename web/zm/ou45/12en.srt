00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,059
Whoa, were you about to hurt Sophie?

2
00:00:05,059 --> 00:00:09,050
No, Mr. President.

3
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:12,179
No, she was about to hurt me. Bullshit!

4
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:13,179
Robert, she was going...

5
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:15,179
Shut the fuck up, sir. If I may,

6
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:18,179
Hannah frames Sophie with regard to the Dragon Group deal.

7
00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:23,480
I think the next words out of your mouth better be the truth.

8
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,480
Well, they have no proof. They're lying.

9
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:42,200
Oh, yeah? What's this? Oh, Hannah, I think it's safe to say you're fired.

10
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,700
Mr. Kenzing...

11
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,450
Goodbye, Hannah.

12
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:52,450
Wait, tell them. Marcus, tell them. Marcus, tell them!

13
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:58,340
I have no idea what she's talking about. She's clearly crazy.

14
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:00,340
I'm so sorry about all this.

15
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,340
Nick, will you please?

16
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,560
With pleasure. Let's go.

17
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,909
Mr. Ken...
