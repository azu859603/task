Mr. Kensington. Where's Kevin? Is this some sort of joke?

2
00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:17.039
I was shocked too.

3
00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.039
Sophie Steele.

4
00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:47.670
I can't believe we worked together this whole time and had no idea.

5
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.060
I know. It's unbelievable.

6
00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.060
You know, I'm still very offended that you didn't show up to the wedding.

7
00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:00.659
Well, now that you worked for me, you know I'm a stickler for punctuality.

8
00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:04.659
It's not my fault that I'll explain everything later.

9
00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:10.549
I gotta say, pretty grateful my husband isn't some fat flop.

10
00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:14.569
He's actually quite handsome.

11
00:01:14.569 --> 00:01:19.219
I definitely lucked out too.

12
00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:20.219
That's what we do now.

13
00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:22.510
We're getting a divorce.
