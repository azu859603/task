00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:01.830
Oh, yeah.

2
00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:05.150
I figured we should get a divorce to start from scratch.

3
00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:08.919
We should have a true marriage from start to finish.

4
00:00:08.919 --> 00:00:11.550
That'd be nice, right?

5
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:12.869
Mr. Kensington, it'd be nice.

6
00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:15.089
I think we're past that.

7
00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:16.820
Call me Robert.

8
00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:22.570
Robert, I just don't think this will work.

9
00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.820
I don't know if this is a good idea.

10
00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.789
Well, I don't want you to feel any pressure

11
00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:35.020
to make a decision right now.

12
00:00:35.179 --> 00:00:37.179
What should have as much time as you need?

13
00:00:37.179 --> 00:00:41.070
The only thing that will ask is

14
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.259
that you do that thinking with me

15
00:00:43.259 --> 00:00:44.500
at my ranch house.
