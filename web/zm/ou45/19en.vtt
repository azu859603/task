00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.549
Okay, you weren't lying.

2
00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:09.869
That was incredible.

3
00:00:09.869 --> 00:00:11.869
Where'd you learn how to do that?

4
00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:13.869
It's actually my first time.

5
00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:17.089
I'm just kidding.

6
00:00:17.089 --> 00:00:21.539
I lived in Italy, actually, for a long time.

7
00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:22.539
Really?

8
00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:24.079
I learned it there.

9
00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:26.079
I loved it ever since.

10
00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:29.210
And your salad isn't too shabby either.

11
00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.210
I don't know.

12
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.210
I won't.

13
00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:37.659
It will take not too shabby.

14
00:00:37.659 --> 00:00:40.780
Is it kind of chilly in here, too?

15
00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:41.780
Yeah.

16
00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.070
Let's go out to the fireplace.

17
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.070
I haven't shown you that yet.

18
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.070
Should we take the wine?

19
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.299
Great idea.

20
00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:53.039
Cheers.

21
00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.420
To good luck.

22
00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.100
They brought us together?

23
00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.579
Twice.

24
00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:07.200
To good luck.

25
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.709
You know, I feel bad.

26
00:01:09.709 --> 00:01:13.099
I don't actually know anything about you.

27
00:01:13.099 --> 00:01:14.099
What do you mean?

28
00:01:14.099 --> 00:01:25.750
For starters, like, we're from parents.

29
00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.750
I didn't mean to cross a little bit.

30
00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.840
I appreciate you wanting to know.

31
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.569
It's just that I...

32
00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:35.569
My parents died.

33
00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:44.900
I was young, so I don't really remember it.

34
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.900
But they told me it was a car accident.
