1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I grew up in a foster home, just outside the city, and then this woman who I now realizes

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,879
your mom took me in when I was 12.

3
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:22,480
She raised me, and the last year she told me that my father actually owes her a lot of

4
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,829
money.

5
00:00:23,829 --> 00:00:29,620
And the only way to pay his debts was to marry her son, who I had never even seen.

6
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:32,780
I guess that's because you're in Italy at the time, like you said.

7
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:40,770
Yeah, I mean, I knew she had taken some money, but obviously I didn't know that was you.

8
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:41,770
That's so weird, though.

9
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:45,289
She would keep us apart our whole lives and then wanted us to get married.

10
00:00:45,289 --> 00:00:46,850
Yeah, that is strange.

11
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:50,530
What about your father?

12
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:53,740
I never knew.

13
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:59,929
He was obviously the one who gave me the Fuji group, and I had the condition that I had

14
00:00:59,929 --> 00:01:03,609
to be married to receive the $100 billion inheritance.

15
00:01:03,609 --> 00:01:07,599
He'd never shut up.
