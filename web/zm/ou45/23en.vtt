00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.240
Hello.

2
00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:02.430
You.

3
00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:04.879
Where the hell am I?

4
00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:06.040
What are you?

5
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.039
Are you fucking crazy?

6
00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:10.039
Let's calm down a little bit.

7
00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:12.199
We can talk about this.

8
00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:14.199
What do you want from me?

9
00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:15.199
Well, it's, um...

10
00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:17.449
It's really quite simple.

11
00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:21.690
I want the Fuji group.

12
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.359
You can understand that, right?

13
00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.359
I can't help you do that.

14
00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:30.120
Your husband can.

15
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.120
See if he divorces you.

16
00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.659
I get the company.

17
00:00:33.659 --> 00:00:35.659
It's, uh, it's actually really quite simple.

18
00:00:35.659 --> 00:00:37.659
You're out of your mind.

19
00:00:37.659 --> 00:00:38.659
Let me go.

20
00:00:38.659 --> 00:00:39.659
Fucking idiot.

21
00:00:39.659 --> 00:00:41.659
Let me go.

22
00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:43.659
You are such a coward.

23
00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:44.659
You're such a coward.

24
00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:47.659
Don't even think about it.

25
00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:52.799
What is wrong with you, man?

26
00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:53.799
What's wrong with me?

27
00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:55.280
Geez.

28
00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.280
Where do we start?

29
00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.500
I want to be honest with you, Robert.

30
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.229
I should have gotten the Fuji group.

31
00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:03.229
Not you.

32
00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:06.680
But your precious daddy decided to give it to you.

33
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.349
You know it's up to you to make things right.

34
00:01:10.349 --> 00:01:11.349
You don't deserve anything.

35
00:01:11.349 --> 00:01:12.349
You piece of shit!

36
00:01:12.349 --> 00:01:13.349
Hey!

37
00:01:13.349 --> 00:01:16.950
You better watch yourself.

38
00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:25.930
I'm calling the shots here.

39
00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.540
No.

40
00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.540
I need from you.

41
00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.540
Sign these divorce papers.

42
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.540
So no one gets hurt.

43
00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.219
You want more money?

44
00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:36.219
No.

45
00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:37.219
Or because if you want more money,

46
00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:38.219
I can give you more money.

47
00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:39.219
You want more money?

48
00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:41.340
I don't want your fucking money!

49
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.340
I want the company.

50
00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.819
Robert.

51
00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:46.849
And if you divorce her,

52
00:01:46.849 --> 00:01:48.849
it's not yours anymore.

53
00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:59.640
I'm not signing them.

54
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:10.310
Made a freakin' second here.

55
00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.180
I might just faint.

56
00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.180
Look at this.

57
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.180
It is.

58
00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.379
You're in love.

59
00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:22.379
Right?

60
00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:23.379
Was this a fucking...

61
00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:24.379
I should have done signing them.

62
00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:25.379
Now let her go.

63
00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:27.430
Mm.

64
00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.430
You always gotta make things so...

65
00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:36.639
Sophie.

66
00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:37.639
Wakey.

67
00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:48.620
Wakey.

68
00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:49.620
I like to bakey.

69
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.680
Have any good dreams.

70
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.099
Fuck you.

71
00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:58.979
Let's try this again, shall we?

72
00:02:58.979 --> 00:03:02.020
Sign it.

73
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:09.939
I thought you might say that.

74
00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:23.139
Everything's gonna be okay.

75
00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:24.460
Marcus.

76
00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.979
This is between you and me, okay?

77
00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:27.979
Leave her out of it.

78
00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:29.389
Okay.

79
00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:32.389
I'm gonna give you to the count of five.

80
00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:33.389
Marcus, stop.

81
00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:34.389
Five.

82
00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:36.419
If you hurt her, I'll fucking kill you.

83
00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:37.419
I swear to God.

84
00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:38.419
Or...

85
00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:40.539
Marcus.

86
00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:42.539
You don't want to do this, okay?

87
00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:43.539
You don't.

88
00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:44.539
I know you don't.

89
00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:46.379
Three.

90
00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:47.919
Marcus.

91
00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:48.919
You're not a killer, okay?

92
00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:49.919
I know you don't want to do this.

93
00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:50.919
Two.

94
00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:51.919
God damn it, Marcus.

95
00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:52.919
Listen to me!

96
00:03:52.919 --> 00:04:08.960
That wasn't so bad, was it?

97
00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.379
You have me going there, man.

98
00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:13.370
Whew!

99
00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:18.120
Let me pull a knife out and everything.

100
00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.120
Can't sign without a hand.

101
00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:43.069
How right you are.

102
00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:44.069
Look at that!

103
00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:45.069
See?

104
00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:46.649
It's all over.

105
00:04:46.649 --> 00:04:47.649
You were great cousin.

106
00:04:47.649 --> 00:04:48.649
Oh, that.

107
00:04:48.649 --> 00:04:50.649
You got John Hancock right there.

108
00:04:50.649 --> 00:04:51.649
Oh!

109
00:04:51.649 --> 00:04:52.649
I almost completely forgot.

110
00:04:52.649 --> 00:04:53.649
Stupid.

111
00:04:53.649 --> 00:04:57.649
You guys have to die in like a tragic accident.

112
00:04:57.649 --> 00:04:59.029
Yeah.

113
00:04:59.029 --> 00:05:00.029
Really, really sad.

114
00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:03.029
Especially since, you know, you just got a divorce.

115
00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:04.029
Tragic day.

116
00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:59.370
Rosie?

117
00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:01.689
I know this is shocking.

118
00:06:01.689 --> 00:06:05.680
I really didn't want it to come to this.

119
00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.680
Robert, give me the document and I'll explain everything.

120
00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:09.680
Explain first.

121
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:14.120
I want revenge on your father.

122
00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:21.120
He swindled me out of the Fuji group and a ten billion dollar inheritance in the divorce.

123
00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.120
And now, oh, this is so poetic.

124
00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:29.660
I get it all back when you two lovers get divorced.

125
00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:31.660
Did you do all this?

126
00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:33.660
All these years, just so I would marry him.

127
00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:36.660
Well, the money became Roberts when he got married.

128
00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:39.819
And now it's going to his next akin.

129
00:06:39.819 --> 00:06:40.819
Me.

130
00:06:40.819 --> 00:06:43.819
So you're doing all this just for more money?

131
00:06:43.819 --> 00:06:46.300
Yeah, I am.

132
00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:47.300
You're sick.

133
00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.370
I'm your son.

134
00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:52.589
Well, actually, no.

135
00:06:52.589 --> 00:06:54.589
You're my stepson.

136
00:06:54.589 --> 00:06:59.509
That idiot on the floor is my son.

137
00:06:59.509 --> 00:07:03.300
That's impossible.

138
00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:04.300
You're lying.

139
00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:07.370
I am known to lie quite a bit.

140
00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:12.100
But unfortunately, not this time.

141
00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.100
Robert, give me the document now.

142
00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.139
I'm not giving you anything.

143
00:07:16.139 --> 00:07:18.420
What about my father's debts?

144
00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:21.649
Oh, I made that one up.

145
00:07:21.649 --> 00:07:24.649
You know, you were always so easy to manipulate.

146
00:07:24.649 --> 00:07:27.000
Light to me.

147
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.060
You raised me just to deceive me.

148
00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:33.540
No offense, my dear.

149
00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:38.610
Robert, the document.

150
00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:40.610
You do that, Robert, and I'll shoot her.

151
00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:42.610
I swear to God, I'll shoot her.

152
00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:44.610
You said money was just a cool part of her.

153
00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:47.610
Shut up and put the lighter down.

154
00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:49.610
I am not giving you this document.

155
00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:52.610
I'm going to give you one last warning.

156
00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:53.610
The gun down.

157
00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:54.610
Now.

158
00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:55.610
Robert!

159
00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:57.610
Put the fucking gun down!

160
00:07:57.610 --> 00:07:58.610
No!

161
00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:09.610
Oh, he was actually the son I really wanted.

162
00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:15.459
You, Sophie, you were my favorite.

163
00:08:15.459 --> 00:08:16.459
Please, please, please, Rosie.

164
00:08:16.459 --> 00:08:17.459
Don't do this, please!

165
00:08:17.459 --> 00:08:19.459
Sorry, my dear.

166
00:08:19.459 --> 00:08:22.459
You're like a mother to me, please.

167
00:08:23.459 --> 00:08:30.800
Who's the idiot now?

168
00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:31.800
Mom?

169
00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:39.870
Marcus?

170
00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:43.590
Marcus?

171
00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:44.590
Marcus?

172
00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:45.980
Marcus?

173
00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:46.980
Marcus?

174
00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:47.980
Stop!

175
00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:48.980
Marcus!

176
00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:49.980
Put it down!

177
00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:50.980
Stop!

178
00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:58.929
Please, you've been shot!

179
00:08:58.929 --> 00:08:59.929
Drop that weapon!

180
00:08:59.929 --> 00:09:03.110
Hey, hey, what's up?

181
00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:04.110
Come here, babe.

182
00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:10.740
Oh, my God.

183
00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:11.740
Sophie.

184
00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:12.740
Robert, are you okay?

185
00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:13.740
He's fine.

186
00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:14.740
You should get him to the hospital.

187
00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:15.740
Sure.

188
00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:19.850
Let's go in.

189
00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:21.850
That's a long story for a different time.

190
00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:23.200
All right, get me out of here.

191
00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.200
Okay.

192
00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:35.659
Robert, do you take Sophie Steele to be your lawfully wedded wife?

193
00:09:35.659 --> 00:09:36.659
I do.

194
00:09:36.659 --> 00:09:42.360
Sophie Steele, do you take Robert Kensington to be your lawfully wedded husband?

195
00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:45.250
I do.

196
00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:51.279
By the power vested in me, I now pronounce you husband and wife.

Again.
