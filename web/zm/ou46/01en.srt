1
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:18,100
Look who this pretty boy is, Ace of Spades, the guy who shot his fucking parents.

2
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:23,429
There's room for only one king in London.

3
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:29,620
Call your boys, tell them to bring back the weapons they stole from me.

4
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:50,210
You have ten seconds.

5
00:00:50,210 --> 00:01:08,930
Nice moves, you're interested in working for me.

6
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:10,930
I don't even know who you are.

7
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:14,060
You haven't heard of Ace of Spades?

8
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:19,290
Not my thing.

9
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,760
See you around.

10
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,760
Wait.

11
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,689
What's your name again?

12
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:36,670
I haven't even told you yet.

13
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:51,019
I'm Max.

14
00:01:51,019 --> 00:02:09,330
Let's try this again and think carefully this time because Ace of Spades doesn't take no for an answer, as well as the catch.

15
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:19,509
Enough?

16
00:02:19,509 --> 00:02:25,659
Maybe.

17
00:02:25,659 --> 00:02:26,659
I'll be waiting.
