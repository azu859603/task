00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:24.579
Boss is on his way back. Go and get him. He's ready.

2
00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:30.199
Yeah, come to my room.

3
00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:32.200
Yeah, set my people to pick you up.

4
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:53.140
Things just got more interesting.

5
00:00:53.140 --> 00:01:03.119
Boss, we've got a bad feeling about Max.

6
00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:05.340
He just came out of nowhere.

7
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.650
What makes you suspicious?

8
00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.739
I don't trust him.

9
00:01:10.739 --> 00:01:12.739
We all know what happens when people fuck with you.

10
00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:14.989
Exactly.

11
00:01:14.989 --> 00:01:16.760
Good job.

12
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.760
And how long have you been here?

13
00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:19.760
Not long.

14
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:20.760
About three months.

15
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.299
Yeah?

16
00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:23.299
What do you know about the boss?

17
00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:25.299
Well, not much.

18
00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:28.689
But you hear things, right?

19
00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:30.980
I mean, his parents.

20
00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.519
Let's just say he's not the type to cross.

21
00:01:34.519 --> 00:01:36.620
He always gets what he wants.

22
00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.620
And the last person that tried to get in his way.

23
00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:46.349
But he takes care of us.

24
00:01:46.349 --> 00:01:48.349
So, I wouldn't worry.

25
00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:49.540
Unless.

26
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:50.540
Unless.

27
00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:57.319
The last person was slaughtered and burned to life.

28
00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:01.500
You reckon history about his parents?

29
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.500
Yeah.
