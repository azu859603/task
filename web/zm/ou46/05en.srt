1
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:20,210
That's my mum. She was quite the beauty, wasn't she?

2
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:37,140
So you've got her eyes?

3
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,259
I'm sure you've, er, heard the story of my parents' death.

4
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:44,259
Heard some rumours.

5
00:00:44,259 --> 00:00:47,060
I don't really believe them.

6
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,700
Who keeps the photo of someone they'd hung right by their bed?

7
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:55,119
What? Me smiles.

8
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:57,359
Who the fuck do you think you are?

9
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:01,100
I'm sorry.

10
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,060
Get out.

11
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:18,140
Get out, get out, leave me alone.

12
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:22,349
The last night, he loved the bosses from at like 3am.

13
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:25,069
I told you, the boss keeps on his shoulder leave.

14
00:01:25,069 --> 00:01:32,769
The bitch.

15
00:01:32,849 --> 00:01:40,750
Don't worry.

16
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:47,090
You son of a bitch!

17
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:48,370
Fucking cunt!

18
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:49,569
Shut your fucking mouth!

19
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:52,689
I don't touch human trafficking.

20
00:01:52,689 --> 00:01:57,250
Robert, who the fuck would do something so disgusting?

21
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:01,120
There's all money at the end of the day, innit?

22
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,719
I don't need to feel like that in my life.

23
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,680
Look at the fuck out.

24
00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:10,530
You fucking prick!

25
00:02:23,789 --> 00:02:24,909
Does it need me to call a doctor?

26
00:02:25,469 --> 00:02:25,949
No.

27
00:02:25,949 --> 00:02:26,509
No.

28
00:02:26,509 --> 00:02:27,310
Nothing serious.

29
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,759
Robert's words upset you.

30
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:37,520
Why?

31
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,180
I'm here to protect you.

32
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,750
It's my job.

33
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:45,009
But I hope it protects you.

34
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:48,419
From me.
