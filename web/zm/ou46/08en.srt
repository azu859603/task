1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,560
Should I keep going?

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,379
Smile.

3
00:00:06,379 --> 00:00:11,140
What the hell are you doing?

4
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:13,169
Oh, just texting Jack.

5
00:00:13,169 --> 00:00:17,170
See, I'm sending Jack a fake address in your name.

6
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:20,170
I'm telling him where he can find his work.

7
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:22,170
No, don't do that!

8
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:28,140
I just had a brilliant idea.

9
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,140
Why don't you send the message yourself?

10
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:50,899
Don't do that to me.

11
00:00:50,899 --> 00:00:51,899
Would you sleep with me?

12
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:55,520
You're getting jealous of Jack now.

13
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:07,540
When I set this trap together,

14
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:49,299
I want to make it that easy for you, you snitch.

15
00:01:49,299 --> 00:01:51,900
So, so long.

16
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,900
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, don't be hasty.

17
00:01:53,900 --> 00:02:03,000
Much better.

18
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,129
Now, I hear the generous.

19
00:02:07,129 --> 00:02:10,060
Blackjack is...

20
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:14,340
It's gifting me by an end casino, right?

21
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,340
Fuck you, Ace.

22
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,759
You fucking psycho.

23
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:19,759
How dare you?

24
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:21,759
You have ten seconds.

25
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:25,909
Oh, wait, that's your line, isn't it?

26
00:02:25,909 --> 00:02:26,909
Nine.

27
00:02:26,909 --> 00:02:27,909
Eight.

28
00:02:27,909 --> 00:02:28,909
Seven.

29
00:02:28,909 --> 00:02:31,449
Three.

30
00:02:31,449 --> 00:02:32,449
Two.

31
00:02:32,449 --> 00:02:33,479
Deal.

32
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:34,539
Good.

33
00:02:34,539 --> 00:02:37,280
Is that in the contract?

34
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,520
You're even more of a cunt than I thought.

35
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,520
Thanks for the compliment.

36
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:55,050
Everything's perfect now.

37
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,780
Oh!

38
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:59,849
By the way, I got you a gift!

39
00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:09,310
That's Jack, gentlemen.
