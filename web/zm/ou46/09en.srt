1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,560
I got you a gift, ha ha!

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:12,330
How about I have some jackets, isn't it?

3
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:13,330
Sorry.

4
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:23,160
In useless fucking bastard!

5
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:34,719
Stop, stop!

6
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,240
Well, I leave for 10 seconds, and this hot guy is crying.

7
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,039
Mmm! Oh, Jack, I've changed my mind.

8
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:45,450
That fuck is wrong with you, twisted psycho.

9
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:46,929
Psychos?

10
00:00:46,929 --> 00:00:50,960
My dear sir, we don't need a reason.

11
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:58,539
I keep it useless, dog.

12
00:00:58,539 --> 00:01:05,620
It's a new verse, sir.

13
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:06,620
Shite, huh?

14
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:07,739
It's fine.

15
00:01:07,739 --> 00:01:10,819
It's fine.

16
00:01:10,819 --> 00:01:22,500
I thought you were a lot tougher than that.

17
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,500
It's all right.

18
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,500
All right, all right, stop crying.

19
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,879
You're safe now.

20
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:30,549
Didn't ask me to save me.

21
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:32,549
Jack has completely abandoned you.

22
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:34,549
You are no value to him anymore.

23
00:01:34,549 --> 00:01:39,859
I won't betray him, but even if I die.

24
00:01:39,859 --> 00:01:44,370
Stand up, come and see your potential.

25
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:48,290
I owe him.

26
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:53,010
The kindness he once showed me.

27
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:55,010
That means a lot to me.

28
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:57,099
Your life, the drawers anymore.

29
00:01:57,099 --> 00:02:00,680
See, I just saved you.

30
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,680
Remember?

31
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,129
So your life belongs to me now.

32
00:02:05,129 --> 00:02:07,129
And I'll repay you too.

33
00:02:07,129 --> 00:02:11,530
Just take it if that's what you want.

34
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:18,360
Dying is too easy.

35
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,479
I have something else in life.

36
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:27,379
Your face took quite a hit too.

37
00:02:27,379 --> 00:02:29,379
We can't have that.

38
00:02:29,379 --> 00:02:41,780
Stay still.

39
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:56,449
Why did you save me?

40
00:02:56,449 --> 00:02:57,449
Take a guess.
