1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:02,690
I'm sorry, Mum.

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:04,690
I'll go now.

3
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:05,690
You should rest.

4
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:08,859
Alex?

5
00:00:08,859 --> 00:00:11,470
Is that you?

6
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:14,179
Where is this place?

7
00:00:14,179 --> 00:00:16,300
Where are we?

8
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:17,300
It's okay.

9
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,300
It's okay.

10
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:19,300
That's me.

11
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,489
It's me.

12
00:00:20,489 --> 00:00:22,059
You're safe here.

13
00:00:22,059 --> 00:00:25,109
Don't worry.

14
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:51,299
One minute to convince me not to.

15
00:00:51,299 --> 00:00:52,299
I won't tell anyone.

16
00:00:52,299 --> 00:00:57,759
How can I trust you?

17
00:00:57,759 --> 00:00:59,759
I won't tell anyone.

18
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:10,209
You trust me this time?

19
00:01:10,209 --> 00:01:14,769
Don't leave me.

20
00:01:14,769 --> 00:01:16,769
I'm here now.

21
00:01:16,769 --> 00:01:20,209
You're so good.

22
00:01:20,209 --> 00:01:25,280
Let me go.

23
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,280
Leaving tomorrow?

24
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,239
Ace has arranged everything.

25
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:30,879
You're safe now.

26
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:36,459
I'm one of Ace's closest friends.

27
00:01:36,459 --> 00:01:38,200
I came here specifically.

28
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:42,150
It's important you get your rest though.

29
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,219
To save your strength for the journey tomorrow.

30
00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:46,400
I'll be here.

31
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,069
To protect both of us.

32
00:01:49,069 --> 00:01:51,640
You promise?

33
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:56,040
What about my Alex?

34
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:01,590
It's still just a gift.

35
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:02,590
Alex is coming with us.

36
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:11,900
We're all going to start a new and good life together.

37
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,900
And let's get back into bed.
