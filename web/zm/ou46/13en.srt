1
00:00:07,339 --> 00:00:09,339
That's what happened to you, Mum.

2
00:00:09,339 --> 00:00:18,829
I was only 15.

3
00:00:18,829 --> 00:00:20,829
Where do you think you're going, darling?

4
00:00:20,829 --> 00:00:22,829
I'm very pleased.

5
00:00:22,829 --> 00:00:24,829
I'm making you.

6
00:00:24,829 --> 00:00:27,829
Oh, Dao, what's going on, Alex?

7
00:00:27,829 --> 00:00:28,929
Come in.

8
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:32,929
This bitch is just about all badness.

9
00:00:32,929 --> 00:00:34,929
Don't you go near him!

10
00:00:34,929 --> 00:00:36,929
Alex, go back to your room!

11
00:00:36,929 --> 00:00:43,420
You know what happens to traitors, right?

12
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:46,920
I want you to tell them.

13
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,920
Are you going to betray me as well, Alex?

14
00:00:48,920 --> 00:01:01,670
I took over the business from my father and moved my mother here to fit safety,

15
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:04,659
but she was never the same.

16
00:01:04,659 --> 00:01:08,239
You see, the trauma just never left her.

17
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:15,359
People love to gossip about me, but only I know the truth.

18
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:21,319
And now you.

19
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:34,579
I blame you as well.

20
00:01:34,579 --> 00:01:36,579
You feel your bleeding, Cher?

21
00:01:36,579 --> 00:01:37,900
Yes, I know.

22
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:56,540
So what's your story?

23
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:02,370
My dad, he was a violent drug.

24
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:04,370
And after his neck and dad's.

25
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:10,650
Every time he came home drunk, he would beat me and my mum.

26
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:20,460
He even forced her to sell herself to pay his debts.

27
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:26,060
Once he almost killed me, my mum tried to stop him.

28
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:29,280
And he, you know.

29
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,259
So she grabbed me and we ran.

30
00:02:34,259 --> 00:02:38,020
No, I'm sorry.

31
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,020
Oh, my dear.

32
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,020
Don't fall asleep.

33
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,020
I love you, Max.

34
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:46,210
I live a good life.

35
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:47,590
No.

36
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,139
No.

37
00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:51,710
Don't fall asleep.

38
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:52,710
No.

39
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:56,729
She, she pissed her.

40
00:02:56,729 --> 00:03:07,460
Jack, I am.

41
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:10,639
I met him that time.
