00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:08.380
It's going on here kid.

2
00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.150
I can't help. It's too late now.

3
00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.660
But what I can assure you,

4
00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.910
she gets a decent feel.

5
00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:18.940
Left down like trash.

6
00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:19.940
I don't know how to work.

7
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:25.879
Stand up, come on.

8
00:00:25.879 --> 00:00:26.879
I'll see your potential.

9
00:00:26.879 --> 00:00:29.739
I'll make a good mob stop.

10
00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:35.460
You know, Jack, you can be ready, Bruce, all.

11
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.460
He's nearly killed me a couple of times.

12
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:50.469
But I'm still grateful to him for what he did for my mum.

13
00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:54.939
And plus, I don't have anywhere else to go.

14
00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:57.009
Did Jack give you that scar on your back?

15
00:00:57.009 --> 00:01:00.670
In the year.

16
00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:16.859
The camera for Robert.

17
00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:18.859
Maybe you'd consider staying.

18
00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:23.709
I don't know working for me properly, this time.

19
00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:32.909
That's right.

20
00:01:32.909 --> 00:02:44.379
You're not a bad person.

21
00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:46.379
We need to get out of here, take your mum and go, it's not safe.

22
00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:49.569
How the fuck did you find out about this place?

23
00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:52.569
Max, tell me you're not involved in this shit.

24
00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:53.699
I'm not.

25
00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:56.460
We need to go, you're wasting time.

26
00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.849
People will be here in a few minutes.

27
00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:00.849
You'll guard us until then, right?
