00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:07.870
Ace, what's happening?

2
00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:09.869
What is it for running?

3
00:00:09.869 --> 00:00:10.869
It's okay.

4
00:00:10.869 --> 00:00:12.869
It's okay. Just playing a game.

5
00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:13.869
Alright?

6
00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:14.869
Stay close to me, Ace.

7
00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:17.030
Make sure not to get caught.

8
00:00:17.030 --> 00:01:09.200
Alright?

9
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:31.329
But if I make it through this...

10
00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:40.069
Are you replying me?

11
00:01:40.069 --> 00:02:02.219
I'm sure they killed you that, then.

12
00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.219
To make sure you owe me one big enough to sell yourself to me.

13
00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:05.219
Not Jack.

14
00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.670
Become my soul.
