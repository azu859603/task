1
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:15,650
It's up with the leg boss.

2
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:16,649
Get the boys together.

3
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:18,870
We're pretty nice to visit tonight.

4
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:38,500
Sorry, Ace.

5
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,939
On time, Ace.

6
00:00:40,939 --> 00:00:42,939
Nonetheless, you promise not to hurt yourself again.

7
00:00:42,939 --> 00:00:49,070
Why do you even bother?

8
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:55,310
You know, Ace, even if a guy loses his strength,

9
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:57,310
you can always tie on a new one.

10
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:59,399
Stop talking.

11
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:01,780
Just leave.

12
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:03,780
Isn't that what you've always wanted to leave?

13
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,420
It's not that simple.

14
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,450
Jack isn't just gonna back off.

15
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:11,079
Let me stay.

16
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:12,079
All right.

17
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:13,269
I wanna help.

18
00:01:13,269 --> 00:01:15,819
My mum did die for me again.

19
00:01:15,819 --> 00:01:18,540
Fuck off.

20
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:25,659
I'm not going anywhere.

21
00:01:25,659 --> 00:01:27,950
No matter what you say to push me away,

22
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:29,950
I'm not leaving you alone.

23
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:31,180
Don't need your pity.

24
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:32,180
It's not pity.

25
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:37,569
I like you.

26
00:01:37,569 --> 00:01:49,670
What did you just say?

27
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:53,599
Ever since you saved me from tracks?

28
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:56,530
Maybe even before that.

29
00:01:56,530 --> 00:02:02,299
You're not as messed up as you think.

30
00:02:02,299 --> 00:02:07,329
Maybe you are, but to me you're incredible.

31
00:02:07,329 --> 00:02:11,259
I think about you all the time.

32
00:02:11,259 --> 00:02:14,310
Dream about you.

33
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:17,310
I mean, these are my shit here.

34
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:20,520
Look at me.

35
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:29,719
Look at my eyes.

36
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:30,719
Say it again.

37
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:33,580
Don't push me away, Ace.

38
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:38,620
I gave you the chance to leave.

39
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:41,449
And you chose to stay.
