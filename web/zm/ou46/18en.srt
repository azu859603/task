1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:19,649
No, you can never leave again.

2
00:00:19,649 --> 00:00:23,500
Leave it.

3
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,739
I can't tell you how to live your life.

4
00:00:26,739 --> 00:00:28,739
From now on, I promise.

5
00:00:28,739 --> 00:01:26,900
I'll be here for you.

6
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:27,900
Not a chance.

7
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,900
Not good for you in your heart.

8
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:30,900
Look, it's talking.

9
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:44,250
You know, I'm almost grateful to Jack.

10
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:46,250
It's a weird way.

11
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:55,170
Without him, I would have never met you.

12
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:56,170
I'll still have to kill him.

13
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:57,170
Of course.

14
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:59,459
I mean, for his both.

15
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:03,659
And for my mum.

16
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:14,550
Who do you think took him off?

17
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:21,090
It's all an end.
