1
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,949
Get up.

2
00:00:08,949 --> 00:00:15,109
Max, you want to be trying me for this fuck.

3
00:00:15,109 --> 00:00:17,469
We always loyal before that,

4
00:00:17,469 --> 00:00:19,469
so I'll offer you a way out.

5
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:21,910
Kill Ace,

6
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:26,510
and I was forgiven.

7
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:29,309
I'm willing to overlook this.

8
00:00:29,309 --> 00:00:30,309
Tram's crush.

9
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:34,030
Otherwise,

10
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:34,869
they both die.

11
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,039
Together.

12
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:38,880
Life for life.

13
00:00:40,969 --> 00:00:42,490
Take mine and let him go.

14
00:00:43,909 --> 00:00:46,270
Life alone isn't enough.

15
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:47,350
Do it now.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,479
I don't want to wait.

17
00:00:55,479 --> 00:00:56,859
Kill him.

18
00:00:56,859 --> 00:00:59,979
You turn to being my beating kid, you want to wait.

19
00:00:59,979 --> 00:01:02,939
You're nothing my body got full of lies to me.

20
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:05,799
We mean nothing to each other.

21
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:07,200
Oh, Max, don't be a cunt.

22
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,959
Shoot me and return to your real fucking master.

23
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:16,099
I could drown in rats.

24
00:01:16,099 --> 00:01:21,170
Would be a delight.

25
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:26,159
This is rigged to blow.

26
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,079
I die within Max.

27
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:29,719
You can't save it.

28
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:34,420
My boys have the place around it.

29
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:38,629
Ha, ha, ha.

30
00:01:38,629 --> 00:01:39,469
Shoot it!
