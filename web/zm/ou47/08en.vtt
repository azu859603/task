1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.960
Only with this fake marriage I'll get rid of my dad's control.

2
00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.300
One year isn't enough for me to fight my mate.

3
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.600
Only if I agree to this fake marriage, I'll keep my job.

4
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.510
I don't want to go back to those old days and suffer false abuse.

5
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:28.179
Though I can't date anyone this year, $50,000 monthly is awesome.

6
00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:31.629
Mr. Green, you may now kiss the bride.

7
00:00:31.629 --> 00:00:34.609
She looks gorgeous in the wedding gown.

8
00:00:34.609 --> 00:00:37.630
But no matter what, she can't compare to my mate.

9
00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.229
If only my mate were standing here right now.

10
00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:47.929
As he prints from a fairy tale, he looks so handsome.

11
00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:56.070
If only my hero were standing here right now.

12
00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.270
Please stop staring at each other, Mr. Mrs. Green.

13
00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.670
You can reserve it for later, after the kiss.

14
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:17.379
As long as you want.

15
00:01:17.379 --> 00:01:19.400
Why are you so happy?

16
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.939
She's just a weak human, rather than a werewolf.

17
00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.140
Stop being such a downer.

18
00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.769
Bryant is happy, I'm happy.

19
00:01:28.769 --> 00:01:31.769
Besides, she can give us an air.

20
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.200
David, what's up?
