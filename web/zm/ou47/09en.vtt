Hey, David, what's up?

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Where are you? We need to pay rent.

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.060
I have too money left. I'm gonna have to borrow your work.

4
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:15.060
Don't worry. I have money. I'll transfer it to you later.

5
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:20.359
What's up?

6
00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:24.519
Nothing. My roommate just needed help with fun.

7
00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:26.579
You live with someone.

8
00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:34.329
You could stay at my other place.

9
00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:38.329
You didn't come in handy because you lived close by and you got in work.

10
00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:44.219
No. No, no, it's okay. I ate.

11
00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.429
My roommate and I, we've been friends for years.

12
00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:57.869
We take care of each other. Mr. Green looks cold, but it turns out quite warm inside.

13
00:00:57.869 --> 00:01:03.869
Well, well, Brian, this woman dares to decline your offer. She's the first one to do so.

14
00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:07.870
I believe you shouldn't have married any other woman except our mate.

15
00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:12.870
Sadly, you've lost your sense of pheromones or we'll find our mates soon.

16
00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.870
Even if it might need you to touch every American woman's hand.

17
00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:22.950
Mr. Green, are you mad at me?

18
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.810
Whatever.

19
00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:32.579
Thank you. Oh, sir. You're a good person.

20
00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.640
Sir, I've got something for the investigation.

21
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:49.769
I found clues about your mate. Her name is Elizabeth. She's right here in Manhattan.
