1
00:00:02,549 --> 00:00:06,629
What happened to her?

2
00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:08,429
Alpha?

3
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:10,429
She's with some guy.

4
00:00:10,429 --> 00:00:25,739
Do you win the case?

5
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:27,739
Of course.

6
00:00:27,739 --> 00:00:31,739
Before the first appeal was closed, the defendant proposed a negotiation of 100 million.

7
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:34,740
I disagreeed until it's increased to 1 billion.

8
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:38,600
Can you believe it?

9
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,600
Where's Brian?

10
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,600
I want to tell him the good news.

11
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,600
Uh, he's not here.

12
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,299
I don't know why you waste your time, Jesse.

13
00:00:47,299 --> 00:00:49,460
He doesn't care about you.

14
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:52,460
Do you know what they call me in the New York Times?

15
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:54,460
Legal, beauty.

16
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:57,460
If I'm not the girl in his eyes, who can it be?

17
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:58,460
You?

18
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:00,460
You can't resist me now.

19
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:07,109
Well, it seems like we'll never know if you're the girl.

20
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:11,859
But someone is.

21
00:01:11,859 --> 00:01:12,859
What the fuck?

22
00:01:12,859 --> 00:01:18,090
Hi, Brian.

23
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:20,090
I settled the case that you gave me.

24
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:26,950
Very well.

25
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:30,950
You dare violate our mate bond and go and find another guy.

26
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:35,420
Who do you think I am?

27
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:36,420
Who is this?

28
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:48,010
She knew.

29
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:51,219
Brian's commercial assistant.

30
00:01:51,219 --> 00:01:53,060
Enough!

31
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:56,060
No, I won't be your defense lawyer.

32
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,060
She's only six!

33
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,060
How could you fucking touch her?

34
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,060
No!

35
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:08,659
You're a pedophile and you deserve to be executed without trial and let your body rot and mud.

36
00:02:08,659 --> 00:02:13,229
So rare to see Brian being so emotional, what happens?

37
00:02:13,229 --> 00:02:15,229
Well, you just got married.

38
00:02:15,229 --> 00:02:16,229
It was wife's ugly.

39
00:02:16,229 --> 00:02:18,939
Hey, Lisa.

40
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:20,939
As Mr. Green's assistant, you had his wedding, right?

41
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:22,939
What does his wife look like?

42
00:02:22,939 --> 00:02:26,180
Well, but...

43
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,370
Well, but...

44
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:28,719
Oh.

45
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:30,719
Brian hasn't made our marriage public yet.

46
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:33,719
Maybe he doesn't want others to know.

47
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:40,800
One took me.

48
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,900
What?

49
00:02:41,900 --> 00:03:00,259
You're the famous attorney, Brian Green.

50
00:03:00,259 --> 00:03:01,259
You're so hot.

51
00:03:01,259 --> 00:03:18,780
Can I have your Instagram?

52
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:22,189
I didn't realize you were such a loyal husband.

53
00:03:22,189 --> 00:03:24,189
You know, I'm only your fake wife.

54
00:03:24,189 --> 00:03:25,189
You can absolutely.

55
00:03:25,189 --> 00:03:31,189
So, if some cute guy comes through, you're going to jump into his arms.

56
00:03:31,189 --> 00:03:35,080
Girls like you are so easy.

57
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:40,849
Girls like me.

58
00:03:40,849 --> 00:03:54,349
Improper to judge someone so ruthlessly did something piss you off?

59
00:03:54,349 --> 00:03:55,349
Be your food slick.

60
00:03:55,349 --> 00:04:03,919
Sir, I think you misjudged that girl.

61
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:06,939
Really?

62
00:04:06,939 --> 00:04:09,310
Well, explain.

63
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:13,659
You're rich and handsome.

64
00:04:13,659 --> 00:04:15,699
You could easily have any girl you wanted.

65
00:04:15,699 --> 00:04:18,920
That girl just now, she had no idea that you were married.

66
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:22,920
Second, that she saw the ring, she backed off.

67
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,240
Why are you judging her?

68
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,259
She was brave.

69
00:04:27,259 --> 00:04:30,410
Lisa's right.

70
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:32,339
I'm out of touch.

71
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:35,689
If you had misunderstood my mate as well,

72
00:04:35,689 --> 00:04:38,199
I should let her tell me the truth in person.

73
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:41,449
I'm sorry, Lisa.

74
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:43,279
My bad.

75
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:45,699
I was being arbitrary.

76
00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:48,209
It's fine.

77
00:04:48,209 --> 00:04:49,500
I forgive you.

78
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,779
Thank you for enlightening me.

79
00:04:52,779 --> 00:04:56,699
Why don't you come with me shopping?

80
00:04:56,699 --> 00:04:59,050
Help me pick out an outfit.

81
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:01,050
As someone important, I have to meet.

82
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:12,709
Back off their heads.

83
00:05:12,709 --> 00:05:14,000
I'm lying.

84
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:25,779
It's been two hours since Lisa and Brian left, and they're not back.

85
00:05:25,779 --> 00:05:27,899
Lisa's such a bitch.

86
00:05:27,899 --> 00:05:31,899
She knows Brian has a wife, but she's so clingy with him.

87
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:35,029
I saw how flirty she was being in his office.

88
00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:36,319
Slide.

89
00:05:36,319 --> 00:06:41,100
Okay.

90
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:45,100
I'll go pay for this and you can wait for me outside.

91
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:52,980
Give me your purse.

92
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:57,480
And your ring.

93
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,149
You can't have it.

94
00:06:59,149 --> 00:07:00,149
You're gonna die.

95
00:07:00,149 --> 00:07:01,149
No!

96
00:07:01,149 --> 00:07:07,610
Back off their heads look alike.

97
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:09,829
Get lost.

98
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:15,449
Don't tell me you're falling in love with me now.

99
00:07:15,449 --> 00:07:21,860
We are a fake couple after all.

100
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:24,860
What were you thinking, Lisa?

101
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,860
They can't be the same person.

102
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:30,060
My hero is much more tender than this guy.

103
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,060
Thank you.

104
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:36,339
Sir, I can't imagine what would have happened if you hadn't showed up.

105
00:07:36,339 --> 00:07:37,339
Don't worry about it.

106
00:07:37,339 --> 00:07:41,600
I mean, I didn't see you for a minute, so I had to check on you, right?

107
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:47,579
So, as a thank you, take this.

108
00:07:47,579 --> 00:07:57,560
For helping me pick up clothes early.

109
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,350
You okay?

110
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:06,170
Sir, I really like it.

111
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:10,170
Aside from my best friend, you're the only person who's been nice to me.

112
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:14,029
I'm just deeply touched.

113
00:08:14,029 --> 00:08:16,029
Well, you can repay me at work.

114
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:19,029
I expect you to be the best lawyer you can be.

115
00:08:19,029 --> 00:08:21,740
I'll work like a Trojan.

116
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:24,740
You were gonna meet someone.

117
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,740
You should go home.

118
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,740
I'll do that.

119
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:28,740
Okay.

120
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:29,740
Yeah, I'll do that.

121
00:08:29,740 --> 00:09:16,700
Is Elizabeth home?

122
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,980
How do you know Elizabeth?

123
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:19,980
Where are you from?

124
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:22,070
From New Jersey.

125
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:23,070
I'm Jersey.

126
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:24,070
Jesus Christ.

127
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:26,139
Look, I'm warning you.

128
00:09:26,139 --> 00:09:28,139
I'm Elizabeth's boyfriend.

129
00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:29,649
Her boyfriend.

130
00:09:29,649 --> 00:09:32,029
Why should I believe you?

131
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:33,029
Let her tell me herself.

132
00:09:33,029 --> 00:09:35,029
You sure do have guts.

133
00:09:35,029 --> 00:09:36,029
Wait here.

134
00:09:42,379 --> 00:09:44,820
Hi.

135
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,389
I kind of came to see you.

136
00:09:47,389 --> 00:09:49,389
He must be some henchmen of Paul's.

137
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:51,389
I could scare him for you.

138
00:09:51,389 --> 00:09:53,389
I'm gonna need your cooperation.

139
00:09:53,389 --> 00:09:57,500
Okay.

140
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,500
Honey, that guy came again.

141
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:11,820
He doesn't believe that I'm your boyfriend, so we're gonna have to prove it to him.

142
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,820
What the fuck out?

143
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:54,139
Hey, where's that coat?

144
00:10:54,139 --> 00:10:55,139
Which coat?

145
00:10:55,139 --> 00:10:57,139
The one my savior gave me.

146
00:10:57,139 --> 00:10:59,139
Oh, you mean Mr. Wax coat?

147
00:10:59,139 --> 00:11:03,070
I'm not that bold, it just throwed away.

148
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:05,070
Mr. Wax?

149
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:07,100
Her name suits him.

150
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:12,480
By the way, Paul made his way to the apartment.

151
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,610
Do we have to move?

152
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:16,789
We have to move?

153
00:11:16,789 --> 00:11:17,789
Not a chance.

154
00:11:17,789 --> 00:11:20,460
He'll find me anyway.

155
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:23,490
Hey, can I be a coward?

156
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:25,809
I'll have to confront him.

157
00:11:25,809 --> 00:11:26,809
You know what?

158
00:11:26,809 --> 00:11:28,809
Let's not talk about your wicked father anymore.

159
00:11:28,809 --> 00:11:31,830
Let's talk about something new.

160
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:34,990
How's work in your newlywed husband?

161
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:37,379
It's good.

162
00:11:38,629 --> 00:11:44,809
As for my vice, not as cold as I thought.

163
00:11:44,809 --> 00:11:47,059
He's warm inside.

164
00:11:47,059 --> 00:11:49,059
He's a fantastic lawyer.

165
00:11:49,059 --> 00:11:50,059
Unbelievable.

166
00:11:50,059 --> 00:11:53,059
You actually like him.

167
00:11:53,059 --> 00:11:55,059
What about Mr. Wax?

168
00:11:55,059 --> 00:11:56,059
You like him.

169
00:11:56,059 --> 00:11:57,059
What's not to like?

170
00:11:57,059 --> 00:12:00,059
How could I resist a haughty?

171
00:12:00,059 --> 00:12:05,360
Show me a pic.

172
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,570
Really?

173
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:09,570
A petty woman.

174
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:11,570
You just don't want to show me.

175
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:21,409
Keep your old phone.

176
00:12:21,409 --> 00:12:22,409
It's late.

177
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:23,409
Who could that be?

178
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,240
Hello.

179
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:37,769
You're bright like the moon in the sky.

180
00:12:37,769 --> 00:12:47,450
Don't ever leave me.

181
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:51,809
No, don't go.

182
00:12:51,809 --> 00:12:57,710
Oh, no, don't go.

183
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:58,710
No, don't go.

184
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:09,279
No, don't go.

185
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:10,279
No, don't go.

186
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:11,279
Don't go.

187
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,399
Don't go.

188
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:17,019
Thank you.

189
00:13:17,019 --> 00:13:18,019
So much.

190
00:13:18,019 --> 00:13:26,389
Oh, my girl.

191
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:28,220
You're bad.

192
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:30,919
You're not.

193
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:32,919
No, I'm not strong.

194
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:47,389
Where's that?

195
00:13:47,389 --> 00:14:06,659
Shagrin, you said I could still be myself after I started this contract.

196
00:14:06,659 --> 00:14:08,659
But I don't think that's the case.

197
00:14:08,659 --> 00:14:12,450
Why did you get so drunk?

198
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:14,450
I don't have to take care of you.

199
00:14:14,450 --> 00:15:01,779
In the contract.

200
00:15:01,779 --> 00:15:14,000
I have to change your shirt and you're going to get sick.

201
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,809
I'm your assistant at work, not at home.

202
00:15:19,809 --> 00:15:21,809
Why am I taking care of you like a baby?

203
00:15:21,809 --> 00:16:18,820
Why did you do that?

204
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:22,179
I'm so sorry.

205
00:16:22,179 --> 00:16:24,179
I won't happen again.

206
00:16:24,179 --> 00:16:25,980
Why?

207
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:29,200
Why did you reject me?

208
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,220
Why?

209
00:16:32,220 --> 00:17:19,819
Morning.

210
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:23,579
Did you take me home yesterday?

211
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:28,450
Don't just sit there.

212
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:30,119
You're going to be late for work.

213
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:32,119
I'll talk it out of your salary.

214
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:57,029
Ready to receive.

215
00:17:57,029 --> 00:18:00,029
Is it real that our mate lives with some other guy?

216
00:18:00,029 --> 00:18:03,589
So sorry.

217
00:18:03,589 --> 00:18:05,940
What shall we do?

218
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:09,579
I guess I'll cut the mate bond with her.

219
00:18:09,579 --> 00:18:11,579
She doesn't even deserve to be our mate.

220
00:18:11,579 --> 00:18:14,859
Stop acting on impulse.

221
00:18:14,859 --> 00:18:16,859
If we didn't lose our sense of pheromones,

222
00:18:16,859 --> 00:18:20,859
our mate never would have been able to climb up to some other guy's bed.

223
00:18:20,859 --> 00:18:22,859
We should win her back.

224
00:18:22,859 --> 00:18:23,859
Win her back.

225
00:18:23,859 --> 00:18:30,880
You are so eager to be the first cut-golden werewolf in the whole werewolf world.

226
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,390
No, I'll cut the mate bond with her right now.

227
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:41,859
Hey Lisa.

228
00:18:41,859 --> 00:18:46,240
Why don't you tell me what happened between you and Brian yesterday?

229
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,240
You guys went out to lunch and they disappeared all after noon.

230
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,299
Then you showed up this morning side by side.

231
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:53,660
You didn't even change your clothes.

232
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:55,660
Do you even go home last night?

233
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,660
You are not going to hook up with Brian.

234
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,660
He's married, you bitch.

235
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,259
What can I do?

236
00:19:01,259 --> 00:19:04,259
I can't declare a marriage Mr. Green wouldn't allow it.

237
00:19:04,259 --> 00:19:10,150
Jesse, when it comes to law, you are a senior.

238
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:13,150
I am nearly an assistant.

239
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:15,150
Incomparable to you.

240
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:19,150
But when you talk like that, it makes me question your professionality.

241
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:20,789
You.

242
00:19:20,789 --> 00:19:21,789
Did I say it wrong?

243
00:19:21,789 --> 00:19:26,859
You don't want an assistant teaching you how to be professional.

244
00:19:26,859 --> 00:19:27,859
Right?

245
00:19:27,859 --> 00:19:30,660
So, watch your mouth.

246
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:36,609
Hello?

247
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:45,440
I was the one who saved you a month ago in New Jersey.

248
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,880
You.

249
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:51,380
I want to say that.

250
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:54,380
Let's meet sometime to cut off our mate bond.

251
00:19:54,380 --> 00:20:06,720
Our mate bond.

252
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,990
What do you mean?

253
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:11,990
12 AM tomorrow.

254
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:21,579
You'll know by then.

255
00:20:21,579 --> 00:20:22,579
Just now.

256
00:20:22,579 --> 00:20:26,660
I hated my heartache when he said to cut the mate bond.

257
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:30,039
What's a mate bond?

258
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:42,259
All werewolves have their mates destined by the moon goddess.

259
00:20:42,259 --> 00:20:49,579
But if they don't want their mate anymore, they can cut their mate bond.

260
00:20:49,579 --> 00:20:54,089
Jack their mate, and they can reject them face-to-face.

261
00:20:54,089 --> 00:21:00,539
Come with me to meet a client.

262
00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:03,329
I'm sorry.

263
00:21:03,329 --> 00:21:04,329
There's some new game up.

264
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:06,329
Can I please be excused for the day?

265
00:21:06,329 --> 00:21:22,250
What happened, honey?

266
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:27,700
I remember when I told you that it was almost violated by a werewolf.

267
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:32,700
Yeah, and Mr. Wax saved you, but what makes you so sad?

268
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,700
He's also a werewolf.

269
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,700
Oh.

270
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,490
You kidding?

271
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:41,000
Oh, I'm not kidding.

272
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,319
Oh, honey.

273
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:45,380
You said that I miss mate.

274
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:47,380
Honey, I'm confused.

275
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:49,380
What's a mate?

276
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,950
Like, like soul mate?

277
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:52,950
Oh, honey.

278
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:54,950
Then shouldn't you be happy?

279
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:56,950
He saved you.

280
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:58,950
And you like him.

281
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:01,950
You two are like bounded soul mates.

282
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:03,950
Why are you crying?

283
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:07,619
He wants to cut ties with me.

284
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:08,619
What?

285
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:09,619
What?

286
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:11,819
Oh, that dumbass.

287
00:22:11,819 --> 00:22:12,819
Okay.

288
00:22:12,819 --> 00:22:13,819
You are a catch.

289
00:22:13,819 --> 00:22:15,819
He doesn't know what he's missing.

290
00:22:15,819 --> 00:22:16,819
Where is he?

291
00:22:16,819 --> 00:22:18,819
I am going to teach him a lesson.

292
00:22:18,819 --> 00:22:23,480
He's the one that saved me.

293
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,480
He has the right to not like me.

294
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,480
And he has the right to reject his mate.

295
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:34,670
So I agreed to cut the mate bond and we're going to meet tomorrow.

296
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:35,670
Face-to-face.

297
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:39,049
I'm glad you think that way.

298
00:22:39,049 --> 00:22:46,390
But I'm going to keep you good company.

299
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:51,240
I'll be here right by your side.

300
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:55,990
And even though I can't marry you,

301
00:22:55,990 --> 00:23:05,640
I'm going to protect you from up to once.

302
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,640
See each other.

303
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:32,380
I've got to have a trick.

304
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:34,369
Any findings?

305
00:23:34,369 --> 00:23:37,369
This is Brian's green swive.

306
00:23:37,369 --> 00:23:39,589
Bernadimious Lisa Sterling.

307
00:23:39,589 --> 00:23:43,970
Also goes by Elizabeth.

308
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:44,970
Beautiful Lisa.

309
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:50,819
Sadly, Brian disturbed us back in New Jersey.

310
00:23:50,819 --> 00:23:53,369
And since you married him,

311
00:23:53,369 --> 00:23:56,369
you're going to be the one to help me defeat him.

312
00:23:56,369 --> 00:24:12,220
Hey, Lisa.

313
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:22,259
I just have been thinking about you since we graduated.

314
00:24:23,259 --> 00:24:25,259
I wouldn't have finished college without you.

315
00:24:25,259 --> 00:24:27,579
I don't expect to see you in New York.

316
00:24:27,579 --> 00:24:31,180
My dear son in policeman.

317
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,180
Yeah, well.

318
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:37,390
You seem to have forgotten who you really are, Mr. Dylan.

319
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:40,970
Pretty bold for you to show up in my place.

320
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:43,130
Do you know each other?

321
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:45,130
Yeah, we more than know each other.

322
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:47,130
Don't get me wrong, Lisa.

323
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:49,130
We just have known each other for quite some time.

324
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:51,130
It seems like he really misses me.

325
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:54,380
So it is rare for us to meet in a crowd like this.

326
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:55,380
Isn't that right, Mr. Green?

327
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:58,799
Do not touch my woman.

328
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:03,769
You're late for work.

329
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:05,769
You still want a salary?

330
00:25:05,769 --> 00:25:06,769
I'm green.

331
00:25:06,769 --> 00:25:17,849
Wait, let's see.

332
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:22,880
Tell me.

333
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,549
How did he find you?

334
00:25:25,549 --> 00:25:27,900
Dylan?

335
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:31,180
Don't get me wrong, sir.

336
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:34,180
Dylan and I went to college together.

337
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:37,420
Or, and I helped him.

338
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:40,000
And he meant to thank me.

339
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:49,259
You seem to be getting pretty intimate with him.

340
00:25:49,259 --> 00:25:53,259
Have you forgotten about your agreement between you and I?

341
00:25:53,259 --> 00:25:58,299
You're not supposed to date any men within the tenure of our contract.

342
00:25:58,299 --> 00:25:59,680
I don't.

343
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:05,900
I swear there's nothing between us.

344
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:08,900
I didn't expect him to show up here.

345
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,900
I haven't even seen him since we graduated.

346
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:14,900
So, Dylan has put his eyes on Lisa.

347
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,900
I'm telling the truth, sir.

348
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:23,250
Okay.

349
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:24,859
Got it?

350
00:26:24,859 --> 00:26:27,359
Come back to work.

351
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:43,200
Daniel, do you remember that werewolf I met back in New Jersey?

352
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,190
Well, he's in New York now.

353
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:50,890
I need you to alert all HAC members.

354
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:54,460
And we need to take precaution.

355
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:55,460
Got it, Alpha.

356
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:56,460
Wait.

357
00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:00,099
Arrange some bodyguards to protect Lisa secretly.

358
00:27:00,099 --> 00:27:02,460
He locked his eyes on her.

359
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:04,460
It's too dangerous for a human.

360
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:06,839
And I don't want any trouble.

361
00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:07,839
Brush that Alpha.

362
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:11,700
By the way, I booked a table for you sound moon restaurant.

363
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:31,400
Shameless, bitch.

364
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,400
You can't stop flirting, can you?

365
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,400
Wasn't the cop enough for you?

366
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,400
You can't turn your tricks on by it.

367
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,400
He's married, you bitch.

368
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:44,039
Jesse, you're joking, right?

369
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:46,039
No, I'm telling the truth.

370
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:47,039
You can see it on her face.

371
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:48,039
It's a vine.

372
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:53,269
Keep it cool.

373
00:27:53,269 --> 00:27:55,269
You don't admit you're a whore.

374
00:27:55,269 --> 00:27:57,779
Are you irritated?

375
00:27:57,779 --> 00:28:01,450
I eat me.

376
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:05,200
Oh, whoa.

377
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,200
She told me to-

378
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:09,829
I'm gonna kill you!

379
00:28:09,829 --> 00:28:10,829
Kill who now?

380
00:28:10,829 --> 00:28:13,559
Brian.

381
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:14,559
She bit me.

382
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:15,559
Everyone here can testify.

383
00:28:15,559 --> 00:28:16,559
She vilified me.

384
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:17,559
We're bored on my shirt.
