1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,299
She vilified me to put water on my shirt. See?

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,980
I don't know. Oh, um, yeah, I can see that.

3
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:14,320
It was an accident. She bit me. She's so mean, Brian. Don't be fooled by her.

4
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:19,379
You know, there's security cameras all over the place. They could check the footage if you want.

5
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:23,559
Okay. I apologize to Lisa.

6
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:28,359
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:31,219
Louder?

8
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:35,310
I'm sorry. I forgive you.

9
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:38,679
Okay. It's over.

10
00:00:39,859 --> 00:00:41,859
You dismiss yourself to go back to work.

11
00:00:53,899 --> 00:00:56,399
This one just Brian cared about all of his trifles.

12
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:03,539
Dear Lisa, do you pardon me?

13
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,340
As an apology, I would like to pass you the most critical case in green. Take the chance.

14
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:25,500
Why is she nice to me? This fish is where we'll even grab it in this world.

15
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,340
I don't want to allow more people to be here, can I?

16
00:01:33,049 --> 00:01:35,849
Still early to cut the bond with Mr. Wark?

17
00:01:36,969 --> 00:01:39,269
I will meet my first.

18
00:01:41,379 --> 00:01:43,379
The murderer is brutal.

19
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,379
Everyone related to the case has either died or been badly hurt.

20
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,379
You're doomed, Lisa.
