00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:04.049
Have you really encountered a werewolf?

2
00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:05.809
Sure. Why would I lie?

3
00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:07.650
I saw it with my own eyes.

4
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:09.570
Those werewolves are wily.

5
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.210
They usually hide among human beings.

6
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.250
But I created a device for detecting werewolves.

7
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:18.370
If the device alerts after I switch on the button,

8
00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:20.769
it will indicate that there are werewolves nearby.

9
00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:30.239
You! You're a werewolf!

10
00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:37.740
Why did she come yet?

11
00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:44.450
Yeah, what's up Daniel?

12
00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.939
She's been in Mark's house for two hours,

13
00:00:47.939 --> 00:00:48.979
and she hasn't come out yet.

14
00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:52.939
Mark, when did she take on the werewolf case?
