00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:01.050
Thank you.

2
00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:02.049
All right.

3
00:00:02.049 --> 00:00:05.200
Do we have?

4
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:14.939
Oh, so it turns out I need to get injured in order to get Brian's attention.

5
00:00:14.939 --> 00:00:15.939
Am I right?

6
00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:18.420
How did you get here?

7
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.420
I have a meeting tonight.

8
00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.420
Were you supposed to come with me?

9
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.420
Or did you forget?

10
00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.500
I rescheduled it.

11
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.500
As it seems.

12
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.840
Aww.

13
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.840
How does such a pretty hand get hurt?

14
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:43.219
You might want to be careful if this ends up affecting the work, Brian won't be happy.

15
00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:46.219
People need to know their place and not touch things they don't deserve.

16
00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:50.500
You're the one who needs to know their place.

17
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.500
Brian, she's messing with your emotions.

18
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.500
You're going to regret it sooner or later.

19
00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:04.060
Get out.

20
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:06.269
Listen.

21
00:01:06.269 --> 00:01:07.400
Don't mind her.

22
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:14.849
Jesse's always starting trouble with everyone.

23
00:01:14.849 --> 00:01:15.849
No.

24
00:01:15.849 --> 00:01:16.849
That was okay.

25
00:01:16.849 --> 00:01:19.549
My friend is picking me up.

26
00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:21.549
Is your friend a guy or a girl?
