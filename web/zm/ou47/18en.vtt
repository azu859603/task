00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:06.250
Wait, zoom in, please.

2
00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:12.539
What's the matter?

3
00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:15.820
Is he suspicious?

4
00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:16.820
No.

5
00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.460
He's just an acquaintance of mine.

6
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:27.780
So, why did you ask me out for coffee?

7
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:28.780
You miss me?

8
00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:38.179
Uh, Dylan, were you at Ellen Street by Lexington Avenue last Saturday?

9
00:00:38.179 --> 00:00:44.500
I don't remember.

10
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.820
Why?

11
00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.820
She's any werewolves there.

12
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.869
Werewolves?

13
00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:51.969
Right.

14
00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:56.969
I am investigating this case right now involving werewolves.

15
00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.189
Did you see any werewolves on Ellen Street?

16
00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:03.450
Werewolves.

17
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.609
Werewolves don't exist in this world.

18
00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:09.609
They exist in fairy tales.

19
00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:12.120
You must be a really big fan of Twilight.

20
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.120
No, I've seen a real werewolf before.

21
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:21.530
Where?

22
00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.739
New Jersey.

23
00:01:23.739 --> 00:01:27.739
Okay, well, do you know who this werewolf might be?

24
00:01:27.739 --> 00:01:36.290
No, but it might be related to the case I'm investigating, so if you find any leads.

25
00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:42.099
Yeah, sure.

26
00:01:42.099 --> 00:01:45.099
But do you think Bryant would be okay with me helping you?

27
00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:46.640
Bryant?

28
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.640
What are you doing here?
