1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:28,539
Can't you see she's drunk?

2
00:00:28,539 --> 00:00:32,070
I wish so, can't.

3
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,070
I love you.

4
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:37,590
I love you.

5
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,009
No.

6
00:00:39,009 --> 00:00:40,170
Mmm.

7
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,030
We still wake up.

8
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:43,030
No, no, no.

9
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:44,380
The relationship is just contractual.

10
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:46,380
Oh, the answer is here.

11
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,380
Is there a show?

12
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:53,439
Okay.

13
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:54,439
There is a show.

14
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:56,439
And he's sober.

15
00:00:56,439 --> 00:01:00,780
Brian, are you also drunk?

16
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,850
Why did you take care of that human girl?

17
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:04,849
She's not your mate.

18
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:06,849
Or are you falling for her?

19
00:01:06,849 --> 00:01:09,579
Don't worry about it.

20
00:01:09,579 --> 00:01:12,579
I won't start a new relationship until after the mate bonds broken.

21
00:01:12,579 --> 00:01:15,159
It's not fair to Lisa.

22
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:16,159
Alright.

23
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,159
It seems like her mate doesn't stand a chance.
