1
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:05,690
What's this?

2
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:10,589
Come on!

3
00:00:10,589 --> 00:00:11,589
Snap out of it!

4
00:00:11,589 --> 00:00:13,039
She's just a regular girl.

5
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:14,039
Not our mate.

6
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:16,039
Why are you pining over like this?

7
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:18,039
She's not like those fain girls.

8
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:20,039
They're just afraid of me.

9
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:22,039
She even hates me.

10
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:33,439
Yeah, well, the girl has no taste.

11
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:35,439
You're the Supreme Alpha.

12
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:37,439
Countless women dream of being your Luna.

13
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:39,439
She's not like those fain girls.

14
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:44,909
It just seemed her first, so it's natural for her to hate me.

15
00:00:44,909 --> 00:00:46,909
How about we just stick with our mate?

16
00:00:46,909 --> 00:00:48,909
We're meeting her in three days, right?

17
00:00:48,909 --> 00:00:50,909
Talk nicely to her.

18
00:00:50,909 --> 00:00:53,909
After all, she's the best match for us.

19
00:00:53,909 --> 00:00:58,090
Geez, don't be mad, man.

20
00:00:58,090 --> 00:00:59,090
I'm just joking.

21
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:08,930
Why hasn't Brian come in?

22
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:09,930
I don't know.

23
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:14,239
I call them, but he didn't answer.

24
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:20,239
Hey, why hasn't Brian come in?

25
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:25,500
Are you his wife?

26
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:34,810
Could it be that Brian is tired of her?

27
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:37,969
Is this my chance?
