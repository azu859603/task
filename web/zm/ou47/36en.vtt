00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:07.519
Sorry sir, but we can't take your case anymore. Why you can't do this to me. You've signed a contract

2
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.480
You don't be a penalty charge. Do you? My boss says he'll pay it. I won't leave

3
00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.120
I need to see Lisa at once. She's the one in charge of my case. I know who the werewolf is

4
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.359
I have big findings

5
00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:21.039
Congrats, but we can't take a case anymore. You need to talk to the law firms

6
00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.320
Lisa here you are

7
00:00:25.879 --> 00:00:27.280
Mike

8
00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:33.979
Are you still werewolf?

9
00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:35.979
These are the photos from the surveillance camera

10
00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.570
I'm just a little blurry. I can't really tell who it is

11
00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.789
Look the ring is limited edition. There's only ten existing in the world

12
00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:49.310
If we find out who owns these rings

13
00:00:49.869 --> 00:01:03.240
We can narrow it down by the culprit. What?

14
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:10.680
Brian might be the werewolf who assaulted you back in New Jersey. I take back everything I said about him

15
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:18.040
I can't believe I defended that fucking scum bag. Maybe he's just good at lying and deceiving both. It's too dangerous

16
00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:24.760
You should stay home for a few days and divorce that bastard

17
00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.469
Get far away from him

18
00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:30.469
Wake up girl

19
00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:50.269
He's the wolf who hurt you. Thank you, Lisa for trusting me Ryan. I wish to terminate our marriage contracts in advance

20
00:01:50.989 --> 00:02:40.919
Why did I was out the one? What did you find?

21
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:50.419
Don't be so anxious. I know it's a big ask and you're really gonna owe me after this one, but

22
00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.400
How do you plan to repay me?

23
00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:59.639
Please don't. I only regard you as a friend

24
00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.830
Sadly, I've known Brian is the werewolf. Oh, I'm so sorry. I

25
00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.590
Almost forgot that you are married

26
00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.210
although it's

27
00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:16.979
Hard for me to restrain myself. I will mind my manners

28
00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.520
Toast

29
00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:57.879
I apologize for my negligence. You got lucky back in New Jersey, but tonight

30
00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:29.860
How do you think Brian will react when he learns? I fucked his beloved

31
00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:32.459
Luna

32
00:04:32.459 --> 00:04:45.490
Your court in death you might be powerful, but I've got the silver blade and now you're gonna fucking die

33
00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.240
Bring it on

34
00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.370
You're gonna wrap this for the rest of your life

35
00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:52.730
Yeah

36
00:04:55.209 --> 00:05:37.680
Sadly we need to take him to a hospital don't recover soon after a few days rest

37
00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.560
Although silver is lethal to wear wolves

38
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:54.300
Alpha is much stronger than your average werewolf. I know you saved us. It's Alpha's orders to protect you secretly

39
00:05:54.939 --> 00:06:02.350
He knew you might be in danger tonight, so we rushed out to save you. I'm never seeing Alpha

40
00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:08.579
So nervous about a grub before I'll leave Alpha to you and go after Dylan then

41
00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:50.819
You are protecting me and I'm sorry. Aren't you you afraid of me?

42
00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:57.529
You know no friends of you. I like you

43
00:07:02.399 --> 00:07:26.990
I'm so sorry. Did I hear you?

44
00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:40.420
I still can't believe that Dylan's the bad guy. I have to tell her about it. You should leave the case to me

45
00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:53.279
I've sent people to capture Dylan. Don't get yourself implicated. It's way too dangerous. I still haven't figured out

46
00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:59.279
What you were doing in New Jersey they back then our pack has been dealing with some malicious

47
00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:12.319
rogue werewolves. I sent some of our pack members about a month ago. It's a patrol and we must have been caught on security cameras

48
00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:43.200
You're injured now. We need to stay here. That girl doesn't seem that bad

49
00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:46.639
Tomorrow's the appointed day

50
00:08:46.639 --> 00:09:01.200
Finally I can cut the meat bond. It seems all need to try and accept our new Luna. Aren't you supposed to be meeting with mr.

51
00:09:01.759 --> 00:09:03.759
Why are we going to the currency?

52
00:09:03.759 --> 00:09:05.720
He couldn't wait a while

53
00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:10.279
Brian's almost done with this medication and doesn't seem like he's recovering

54
00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:13.899
Brian is way more of a gentleman than that mr. Wack

55
00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:16.710
Brian should be the actual hero to you

56
00:09:17.509 --> 00:09:21.639
But once I recur in this coach, I will have no connections to him

57
00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:48.399
That's not nice both. I wonder why it's not reserved. I'm a text my husband. Daniel booked that table for me

58
00:09:48.399 --> 00:09:57.120
So that woman must be like such a honey. He's an angel landing on earth. Let's get this over with

59
00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:02.710
Oh my god, is it coming over?

60
00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:10.389
I, Brian Green, alpha of the silver moon pack, reject you as my mate and Luna

61
00:10:11.809 --> 00:10:24.019
Lady you should accept my rejection. Lady you should accept my rejection. I accept your rejection

62
00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:28.740
I'm married you're handsome, but I can't accept you

63
00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:34.610
May we never see each other again

64
00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:40.639
What a pity

65
00:10:40.639 --> 00:10:42.480
It's a pretty face

66
00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:46.500
Let's be mentally challenged

67
00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:50.100
Excuse me madam someone else has a table reserved. Would you please follow me?

68
00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Let's wait

69
00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:08.850
Yes

70
00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:11.809
I must be the one that saved me before

71
00:11:19.039 --> 00:11:21.039
Thank you for saving me

72
00:11:23.519 --> 00:11:28.980
This is your coat. I'm returning it to you. I agree to cut ties with you

73
00:11:29.779 --> 00:11:33.639
From today on there will be no connections between us

74
00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:37.240
I wish you

75
00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:40.389
Right future

76
00:11:42.629 --> 00:11:49.360
Oh shit, take it back

77
00:11:49.919 --> 00:12:00.980
I'm like involved in a three-prink right now

78
00:12:06.659 --> 00:12:09.059
Lisa, I know your secret

79
00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:12.500
But you and Brian have it all muddled up

80
00:12:14.419 --> 00:12:15.940
Let me help you

81
00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:27.940
Well, this is especially prepared for you

82
00:12:28.019 --> 00:12:52.769
I got some new bandages

83
00:12:52.769 --> 00:12:54.450
No, no, no, it's okay

84
00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:56.000
Why does it hurt?

85
00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.860
No, I just don't

86
00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:01.440
If you could feel better if you just stay with me

87
00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:04.639
You know, I finally handled my private matters

88
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.320
We can be together for the rest of my life

89
00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:13.830
Brian

90
00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:15.110
I love you

91
00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:29.649
I can explain

92
00:13:29.649 --> 00:13:31.649
You know that I hate lies

93
00:13:31.649 --> 00:13:36.919
I just wanted you to stay with me because it's too dangerous with the werewolf

94
00:13:36.919 --> 00:13:38.360
Dylan has his eyes on you

95
00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:39.399
I know

96
00:13:39.399 --> 00:13:40.679
You're worried about me

97
00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:43.889
But you're in danger if Mark thinks that

98
00:13:43.889 --> 00:13:48.789
You're the little girl, you have no idea what an alpha's power has against humans

99
00:13:48.789 --> 00:13:51.139
It even hurt me

100
00:13:51.139 --> 00:15:59.779
You're the biggest surprise to you

101
00:15:59.779 --> 00:16:04.629
Since the power of the werewolf

102
00:16:04.629 --> 00:16:05.990
Right, you're my queen

103
00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:09.059
But I haven't got yours, Austin

104
00:16:09.059 --> 00:16:12.080
But enough energy to think about what this seems

105
00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:41.009
Is breakfast for you

106
00:16:41.009 --> 00:17:26.130
I'm not gonna change you

107
00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:26.849
Thank you, welcome

108
00:17:26.849 --> 00:17:38.930
You will come soon

109
00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:42.710
You know, it's an honor to have your favor

110
00:17:43.269 --> 00:17:44.230
Attorney Jesse

111
00:17:45.359 --> 00:17:46.799
I'm doing this for myself

112
00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:51.200
Once you get Lisa, there will be no one to compete with me and Brian

113
00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:53.430
What a vicious woman

114
00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:55.539
I like it

115
00:17:56.759 --> 00:17:57.720
What are you doing?

116
00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:58.519
What am I doing?

117
00:17:59.799 --> 00:18:02.519
How do you expect me to just throw away already pray

118
00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:05.240
After you've thrown yourself into my domain

119
00:18:06.849 --> 00:18:08.559
You've done your job

120
00:18:08.559 --> 00:18:10.079
And now it's my turn

121
00:18:10.079 --> 00:18:12.309
To have a taste of your body

122
00:18:12.309 --> 00:18:14.069
Before you become useless to me

123
00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:23.220
Is anyone here?

124
00:18:23.890 --> 00:18:25.009
I'm here for the jacket

125
00:18:37.829 --> 00:18:38.789
We lost

126
00:18:38.789 --> 00:18:40.680
Are you lost?

127
00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:41.319
Dear Lisa

128
00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:45.890
How come it's you killed Jesse?

129
00:18:47.109 --> 00:18:49.589
Well, I thanked her for luring you here

130
00:18:50.309 --> 00:18:51.670
I know she was picking on you

131
00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:54.900
So you should thank me

132
00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:56.099
You're a demon

133
00:18:57.670 --> 00:18:59.190
You won't slip away this time

134
00:18:59.190 --> 00:19:15.490
How come the scene is like the one back in New Jersey

135
00:19:16.369 --> 00:19:17.170
Brian

136
00:19:17.569 --> 00:19:19.809
No, it can't be Brian

137
00:19:19.809 --> 00:19:22.450
I met the guy in person, I was overthinking

138
00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:31.319
Brian

139
00:19:31.319 --> 00:19:32.839
Thought I was easy to track, didn't you?

140
00:19:33.619 --> 00:19:34.579
You fell for the bait

141
00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:39.250
In this territory, there are hundreds of rogue wolves

142
00:19:40.259 --> 00:19:41.700
I'll defeat you

143
00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:43.539
And become the new alpha

144
00:19:43.539 --> 00:19:45.920
Of the silver moon pack

145
00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:47.359
It's just a shame

146
00:19:47.359 --> 00:19:51.640
You ruined your chance to witness me having fun with Lisa

147
00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:55.029
Which a buzz kill you are

148
00:19:56.039 --> 00:19:57.089
But

149
00:19:57.089 --> 00:19:58.789
That doesn't matter

150
00:19:58.789 --> 00:20:00.150
I'll kill you

151
00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:01.190
And then fuck her

152
00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:01.990
Go to hell

153
00:20:04.049 --> 00:20:05.170
Daniel

154
00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:06.049
Take Lisa away

155
00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:09.460
Please come back

156
00:20:10.819 --> 00:20:12.579
No, no, I'll stay with Brian

157
00:20:12.579 --> 00:20:13.859
It's dangerous here

158
00:20:13.859 --> 00:20:14.900
Alpha will get distracted

159
00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:15.380
He's worried

160
00:20:16.099 --> 00:20:17.779
Alpha will be safe, trust me

161
00:20:17.779 --> 00:20:18.420
No!

162
00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:19.539
Daniel take her away

163
00:20:21.109 --> 00:20:22.390
No, I'm staying with Brian

164
00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:23.910
I don't care if we die together

165
00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:24.390
No!

166
00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:55.650
Alpha Brian

167
00:20:55.650 --> 00:20:57.089
Commanded me to protect you

168
00:20:57.089 --> 00:20:58.049
I can't disobey him

169
00:20:58.450 --> 00:21:03.519
Come back and he must be in danger

170
00:21:05.089 --> 00:21:06.690
My mission is to safeguard you

171
00:21:06.690 --> 00:21:08.049
Until alpha returns home

172
00:21:08.609 --> 00:21:18.160
Please come down

173
00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:18.880
No!

174
00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:20.930
Luna

175
00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:21.890
Don't do it

176
00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:26.880
I'll take you there

177
00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:41.240
Alpha

178
00:21:41.240 --> 00:22:08.480
Did you miss me, baby?

179
00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:25.220
I must have lost it in the fight

180
00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:30.609
I'm sorry, you won't

181
00:22:30.609 --> 00:22:33.170
You made a mess out of yourself just to find me

182
00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:34.369
Come on, let's go clean you up

183
00:22:34.369 --> 00:22:35.970
I mean

184
00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:38.640
Your face looks like it's painted

185
00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:41.380
Okay fine, clean me up

186
00:22:42.289 --> 00:22:42.849
No

187
00:22:44.099 --> 00:24:22.930
But if I want that

188
00:24:22.930 --> 00:24:23.970
Hey buddy

189
00:24:23.970 --> 00:24:26.289
I can kind of feel your senses recovering

190
00:24:26.289 --> 00:24:28.369
But it's kind unstable

191
00:24:28.369 --> 00:24:30.609
But I'm sure our mate is nearby

192
00:24:30.690 --> 00:24:32.210
I feel it too, how come you?

193
00:24:35.009 --> 00:24:37.170
I think it's because Lisa was too great

194
00:24:37.170 --> 00:24:38.930
She's like perfect

195
00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:42.210
Oh, and there was a round moon last night so

196
00:24:42.210 --> 00:24:44.069
Right, that's the reason

197
00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:48.259
Chris, I cut the mate bond

198
00:24:48.259 --> 00:24:49.779
How can I still feel her?

199
00:24:49.779 --> 00:24:52.319
She playing some kind of trick on me

200
00:24:52.319 --> 00:24:53.519
Jesus

201
00:24:53.519 --> 00:24:54.799
What's going on?

202
00:24:54.799 --> 00:24:56.319
If Lisa finds out

203
00:24:56.319 --> 00:24:57.839
She's not gonna be happy

204
00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:01.140
I'll ask her a mate out and reject her

205
00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:22.819
The bond still isn't cut

206
00:25:22.819 --> 00:25:23.859
We have to meet up again

207
00:25:25.009 --> 00:25:25.809
It's not cut

208
00:25:28.579 --> 00:25:30.099
Okay, we'll meet again soon

209
00:25:30.869 --> 00:25:31.589
I need a hurry

210
00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:33.670
I found my mister right

211
00:25:33.670 --> 00:25:35.519
I love him so much

212
00:25:35.519 --> 00:25:37.599
I don't want misunderstandings between us

213
00:25:38.559 --> 00:25:39.680
Let's meet this afternoon

214
00:25:43.109 --> 00:25:44.839
2 p.m

215
00:25:44.839 --> 00:25:59.190
Deal

216
00:25:59.190 --> 00:25:59.990
I was looking for you

217
00:26:01.589 --> 00:26:02.710
I can't let him find this

218
00:26:04.069 --> 00:26:05.509
He'll be jealous

219
00:26:05.509 --> 00:26:05.990
For sure

220
00:26:07.650 --> 00:26:09.730
Anyway, I'll cut the tie this afternoon

221
00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:26.119
Hey, honey

222
00:26:28.309 --> 00:26:29.910
I have something I have to do

223
00:26:30.549 --> 00:26:31.509
This afternoon

224
00:26:31.509 --> 00:26:32.950
So I won't be able to go any

225
00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:33.509
It's all right

226
00:26:33.509 --> 00:26:33.990
Uh uh

227
00:26:34.549 --> 00:26:35.269
You know what David

228
00:26:39.809 --> 00:26:40.609
Oh

229
00:26:40.609 --> 00:26:41.089
Lisa

230
00:26:41.089 --> 00:26:41.569
Ryan

231
00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:47.589
What are you gonna meet your friend?

232
00:26:47.589 --> 00:26:48.230
Where's he at?

233
00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:50.390
Uh he's on his way

234
00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:57.200
You weren't you meeting with Daniel to handle your business

235
00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:58.000
I um

236
00:26:59.029 --> 00:27:00.470
He uh

237
00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:03.170
He told me to meet him here

238
00:27:03.170 --> 00:27:07.000
So, I'm doing that

239
00:27:08.119 --> 00:27:09.720
Should we go inside?

240
00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:31.680
Has Lisa misunderstood me and deliberately sat here

241
00:27:33.319 --> 00:27:35.799
He's spying on me now

242
00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.680
Why does he sit together with me?

243
00:27:39.779 --> 00:27:40.660
It's 2 p.m

244
00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:42.529
She'll come soon

245
00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:44.930
What if Lisa misunderstood me?

246
00:27:48.390 --> 00:27:50.630
Ryan will definitely find him

247
00:27:51.269 --> 00:27:52.630
Please don't fight by then

248
00:27:53.730 --> 00:27:54.930
Lisa's a kind girl

249
00:27:55.839 --> 00:27:56.880
She'll understand me

250
00:27:58.710 --> 00:28:00.230
I better call the woman and urge her

251
00:28:01.559 --> 00:28:04.119
I no longer want any connections with her

252
00:28:04.119 --> 00:28:06.660
Ryan isn't that

253
00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:07.380
Patty

254
00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:08.900
I should hurry

255
00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:18.599
And cut ties with Mr. Mark

256
00:28:18.599 --> 00:28:20.279
Lisa, I need to take a phone call

257
00:28:20.279 --> 00:28:24.900
Yeah, I need a bigger call too

258
00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:32.450
Are you here?

259
00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:33.809
Yeah, I'm sitting right here

260
00:28:33.809 --> 00:28:37.480
I'll come and not see you

261
00:29:18.789 --> 00:29:21.970
I misunderstood you for so long

262
00:29:21.970 --> 00:29:23.650
Unexpectedly you are my me

263
00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:29.839
Best gift moon goddess could give me

264
00:29:29.839 --> 00:29:31.359
You know all years past

265
00:29:31.359 --> 00:29:43.140
I still remember how

266
00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:44.740
I'll make it up to you right now

267
00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:49.220
I'll make it up to you right now

268
00:29:56.019 --> 00:29:56.980
It's not good enough

269
00:29:58.279 --> 00:29:59.480
Can't forgive you that easily

270
00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:05.140
I need to think of a good munch

271
00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:08.069
Okay, I'll listen to you

272
00:30:08.069 --> 00:30:18.900
My mother, what are you?

273
00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:21.000
Good morning sweetheart

274
00:30:21.559 --> 00:30:24.039
We're just calling on you too

275
00:30:24.039 --> 00:30:25.160
Have breakfast

276
00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:26.920
Right, that's why

277
00:30:28.690 --> 00:30:31.170
Since when do we eat breakfast at 5 a.m

278
00:30:32.119 --> 00:30:33.799
I'm the boss of this family

279
00:30:33.799 --> 00:30:36.279
It's only been half a year since you

280
00:30:36.279 --> 00:30:37.960
Took over my alpha throne

281
00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:39.880
Now you're starting to belittle me

282
00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:41.160
No dad, I'm not

283
00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:42.119
All right

284
00:30:42.119 --> 00:30:44.680
Ken, we can stop the act

285
00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:46.039
Lisa sweetheart

286
00:30:46.039 --> 00:30:49.519
We're just so excited to know

287
00:30:49.519 --> 00:30:51.359
When are we gonna have a grand son?

288
00:30:51.359 --> 00:30:53.200
Mom, it's the 21st century

289
00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:54.799
That's so what?

290
00:30:54.799 --> 00:30:55.920
We're werewolves

291
00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:58.160
Descendants are important to us

292
00:30:58.799 --> 00:31:01.519
I don't care about the human world

293
00:31:01.519 --> 00:31:02.559
But werewolves

294
00:31:07.559 --> 00:31:10.210
Honey

295
00:31:10.210 --> 00:31:13.059
Oh, baby
