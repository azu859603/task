1
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:23,010
This is not my dorm.

2
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:28,010
Please, Mrs. Miller, please keep your hat still.

3
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:31,550
Mrs. Miller, I've just been harper.

4
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:35,119
What's going on?

5
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:40,240
This may come as a shock, but you have amnesia.

6
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,240
Amnesia?

7
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,240
Yes, you damage your hippocampus in a car accident.

8
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:50,780
Resulting in partial memory loss.

9
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:55,259
You probably think you're 21, but you're actually 25.

10
00:00:55,259 --> 00:00:59,619
And you're married to Patrick Miller.

11
00:00:59,619 --> 00:01:04,299
Is Patrick?

12
00:01:04,299 --> 00:01:05,299
Yes.

13
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:10,489
And me.

14
00:01:10,489 --> 00:01:18,849
Wow.

15
00:01:18,849 --> 00:01:19,849
You doesn't know I've lost my memory.

16
00:01:19,849 --> 00:01:21,780
Don't tell him.

17
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,799
No, why will we?

18
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:28,420
I finally got the minor point dreams.

19
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:30,620
One complicated thing.

20
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:35,579
I'm just going to enjoy being Mrs. Miller.

21
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:38,799
Patrick, I've loved you for so many years.

22
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:50,459
I know you're Patrick Miller.

23
00:01:50,459 --> 00:01:52,459
The big stern campus.

24
00:01:52,459 --> 00:01:59,209
Everyone in this college knows how much I love him.

25
00:01:59,209 --> 00:02:08,030
I'm ready to give him all my heart.

26
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:12,030
The five-year-old me has a hot hobby and tons of money.

27
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:28,469
Patrick will have to seem a dress like this.

28
00:02:28,469 --> 00:02:29,469
This is him.

29
00:02:29,469 --> 00:02:31,469
My husband.

30
00:02:31,469 --> 00:02:41,849
You're awake.
