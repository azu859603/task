1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:04,650
Patrick, thought you were really injured.

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:07,049
Yeah, and you're all dressed up.

3
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:09,050
It'll make sense now.

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,550
You're all lying to Patrick again.

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,349
I was this woman.

6
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:15,849
I feel disgusted just looking at her.

7
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:19,500
And no wonder why.

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,280
Just saying it.

9
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,280
I'd need to make in false and defamatory remarks

10
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,579
about vegan children and her company.

11
00:00:28,579 --> 00:00:29,679
What the hell?

12
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,079
I'm not starting this nonsense.

13
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:33,380
What?

14
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:35,479
What did you just say?

15
00:00:35,479 --> 00:00:37,880
You never seen no to Patrick.

16
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,780
So you really want me to sign this?

17
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:41,679
You're me out.

18
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:46,079
Patrick, give me a second.

19
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,539
Jasmine Darlene, you can't just be my company.

20
00:00:50,539 --> 00:00:53,439
Patrick and I worked so hard for him.

21
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:02,149
Jasmine, are you out of your mind?

22
00:01:02,149 --> 00:01:04,879
Vivian, are you okay?

23
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,680
What's wrong with you?

24
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,879
Are you just trying to kill me?

25
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:11,980
Patrick, she's really scaring me.

26
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:14,879
You promised my parents you'd take care of me.

27
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:19,379
Jasmine, enough is enough.

28
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:22,760
Do you still want to be Mrs. Miller or not?

29
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:29,359
Ask me.

30
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:31,780
Ask I.

31
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:34,700
Vivian, are you right?

32
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,299
You better learn to respect Vivian

33
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:38,000
if you plan on being Mrs. Miller.

34
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:46,030
Looks like being married to my crush

35
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:49,719
was never a really big dream.

36
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:53,239
What a little joke of a marriage.

37
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:58,260
Wow, I didn't realize you were such a jerk, Patrick.

38
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,260
What?
