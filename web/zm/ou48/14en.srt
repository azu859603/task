1
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:05,129
Well, let's both just calm down, okay?

2
00:00:05,129 --> 00:00:18,649
It's workaholic.

3
00:00:18,649 --> 00:00:21,649
How come you're suddenly free to have a drink?

4
00:00:21,649 --> 00:00:26,219
Your brother proposed to me yesterday.

5
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:29,440
What the fuck?

6
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:33,439
How did I not see that he was so into you before?

7
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:35,630
Well, of course he refused, right?

8
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:39,630
How do you know if you wanted mad at I know

9
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:41,820
that he still had feelings for Patrick?

10
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:46,770
What's happening to me?

11
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:48,799
I thought I hated him.

12
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:55,780
Do you remember how obsessed you were with him in college?

13
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:58,679
He was always in the library,

14
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:02,679
and you would come up with all kinds of excuses

15
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:06,579
just to bump into him.

16
00:01:06,579 --> 00:01:09,579
My god, I was so silly back then.

17
00:01:09,579 --> 00:01:13,579
Yeah, and he was so busy when his exams

18
00:01:13,579 --> 00:01:17,579
that he couldn't even remember your name

19
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:21,700
for a mom.

20
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:25,700
But you didn't mind because you liked how serious

21
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:30,069
he was about his studies.

22
00:01:30,069 --> 00:01:34,069
How could feelings like this disappear that easily?

23
00:01:34,069 --> 00:01:38,159
Well, he doesn't sound like you're not supposed to

24
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,299
us being together anymore.

25
00:01:43,299 --> 00:01:48,810
Maybe I just know that this grown-up, Jasmine

26
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:55,719
wouldn't lose herself over a men.

27
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:56,719
And you know what?

28
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,069
If you still have feelings for him,

29
00:01:59,069 --> 00:02:01,650
you should be honest with him about it.

30
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:10,500
Then I will try spending more time with him.

31
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,500
Patrick!

32
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:15,300
He wants a divorce because you are planning to marry someone else.
