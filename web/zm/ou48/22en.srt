1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,080
What?

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,980
How could that be true?

3
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:05,500
Isaac is here?

4
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:07,419
No way, it can't be.

5
00:00:07,419 --> 00:00:10,179
I genuinely painted the last painting what? Four years ago.

6
00:00:10,179 --> 00:00:12,380
And then disappeared. It's got to be a hoax.

7
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:18,300
They said this art is behind that and countless other masterpieces is dead.

8
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,829
How could they be here?

9
00:00:20,829 --> 00:00:23,390
Isaac, what are you insinuating?

10
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:28,620
Isaac is standing right next to me,

11
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:32,460
and her name is...

12
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,979
Jasmine Harper.

13
00:00:36,979 --> 00:00:39,780
But this reprise, stop embarrassing me in public.

14
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,979
How could it be Isaac?

15
00:00:41,979 --> 00:00:43,859
That girl is Isaac.

16
00:00:43,859 --> 00:00:45,100
Come on.

17
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,140
Even she looks so shocked by that.

18
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:51,020
Don't you think their mind and campaign went too far?

19
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:53,859
Well, she's a pretty girl, I give her that.

20
00:00:53,859 --> 00:00:56,100
But how can she be a genius artist?

21
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,289
You gotta be kidding me.

22
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:01,179
Jess, trust me.

23
00:01:01,179 --> 00:01:33,459
Vivian was line, huh?

24
00:01:33,459 --> 00:01:37,650
No wonder where she's always been after Patrick.

25
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:39,530
How low of her?

26
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:40,780
Sad.

27
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,299
So pathetic.

28
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:48,489
Hey, leave, leave, stop, stop.

29
00:01:48,489 --> 00:01:53,209
Give us a kiss, save me, save me, save me, save me.

30
00:01:53,209 --> 00:02:02,769
I think you have no rights to be here.

31
00:02:02,769 --> 00:02:03,849
Leave.

32
00:02:03,849 --> 00:02:12,259
Ah, God, you do this to me, pomis!

33
00:02:12,259 --> 00:02:21,300
Make your regret!

34
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:25,280
I'm Isaac, the anonymous artist who vanished.

35
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,000
What are the things from the past how I've forgotten?
