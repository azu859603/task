1
00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.339
She said she needed to be alone for a while.

2
00:00:03.339 --> 00:00:06.339
Look, they're fighting by the pool.

3
00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:08.339
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

4
00:00:09.339 --> 00:00:15.339
The popular influencer Lizzie is here, streaming live.

5
00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:22.850
Let's say hi to all of her fans.

6
00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:23.850
Fuckin' bitch.

7
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:24.850
What?

8
00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:31.850
Are these our CEO's wife and Miss Vivian Jones?

9
00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.390
I'm gonna tell Patrick you're trying to kill me.

10
00:00:40.539 --> 00:01:07.540
It's fine, it's no longer been killed yet.

11
00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:08.540
You can't you.

12
00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.939
If you hadn't shown up, oh don't know where.

13
00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.299
I would have been the one marin Patrick just like my parents wanted.

14
00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:28.920
I've got to withdraw my investment.

15
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.819
I had no idea this restaurant had such big issue.

16
00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:42.000
It's crazy joke. Let's get out of here.

17
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:56.819
Fuckin'!

18
00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:58.819
You don't want to help me, not you.

19
00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:02.849
That's how he's, that's how he's always been.

20
00:02:02.849 --> 00:02:12.539
He'll kill you right if he did that for me.

21
00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:15.500
I heard the entire conversation.

22
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.500
I'm sorry.

23
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.500
I never believed you about Vivian.

24
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:25.969
Especially to apologize.

25
00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:42.430
Let's just go.

26
00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.530
I didn't expect Isaac to be a fighter.

27
00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.870
And I didn't expect you to help me.

28
00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.289
It's my fault.

29
00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:56.539
I didn't realize Vivian was targeting you all along.

30
00:02:56.539 --> 00:03:00.539
I've been so nice to me just because I'm already Isaac though.

31
00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:09.139
Is it hard to believe that I'm honest with you and generally want to make up for the past?

32
00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:12.740
How can I fall for him again so easily?

33
00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:20.300
I'm just wondering why he hid Isaac's identity from me.

34
00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.300
The same question I have from myself.

35
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:28.490
I guess someday you'll know if we don't become enemies by then.

36
00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:32.490
We'll never become enemies, as long as you're willing to open up to me.

37
00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.939
I'm sorry to interrupt.

38
00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:51.520
I brought a glass of milk for Mrs. Miller as you asked Mr.

39
00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.520
I'm going back to Vibes.

40
00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.349
Wait, wait. It's so late already.

41
00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:00.349
Please stay. Your bedroom is ready and tied it up.

42
00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:14.580
What did I do this time?

43
00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.579
Oh no. I totally forgot.

44
00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.579
Mrs. Miller is allergic to milk.

45
00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:21.740
I can't believe I didn't even know this.

46
00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:23.740
Why didn't you tell me?

47
00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.740
She did tell you when you got married.

48
00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.740
But it seems like you forgot about it.

49
00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.550
So nice.

50
00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.550
I can't blame it to all of you. The company was in crisis.

51
00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.550
Yeah, I know, but still we're married.

52
00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:42.529
I can't neglect it her like this.

53
00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:43.529
Wait.

54
00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:50.569
Is there anything else I don't know about her?

55
00:04:50.569 --> 00:04:55.259
I can't think of anything else at the moment.

56
00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:56.839
Call the chef.

57
00:04:56.839 --> 00:04:58.129
The driver.

58
00:04:58.129 --> 00:05:00.319
Everyone. We're having a meeting.

59
00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:03.319
But sir, it's one in the morning.

60
00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:05.319
They must be asleep.

61
00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:07.319
How about tomorrow?

62
00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:28.550
Yes, tomorrow is 6am.

63
00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:29.649
They'll reach you.

64
00:05:29.649 --> 00:05:32.649
We were wondering if you're interested in doing the exhibition.

65
00:05:32.649 --> 00:05:34.649
I'm sorry, sorry. I can't talk right now.

66
00:05:34.649 --> 00:05:35.649
I'll get back to you soon.

67
00:05:35.649 --> 00:05:46.740
The information got leaked.

68
00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.500
Oh.

69
00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.500
My God.

70
00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:51.500
Your Isaac.

71
00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.500
I can't believe you never told me.

72
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:54.500
Maybe trust me.

73
00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.500
I found out you're on the same time as you.

74
00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.500
I had completely forgotten.

75
00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:00.759
Like Patrick.

76
00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:05.759
Set up a talent agency and assign me as your agent.

77
00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:08.759
My phone has been blowing up all morning.

78
00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:10.050
What?

79
00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:12.430
He didn't even discuss it with me.

80
00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:16.779
But it's a good thing, isn't it?

81
00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:21.610
I just don't want anyone making decisions in my behalf.

82
00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:24.610
Mrs. Miller doesn't eat red meat only white.

83
00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:26.610
Oh, she loves sweets.

84
00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:29.610
No wonder why she's always made me cakes before.

85
00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:33.610
She's also allergic to milk, mangoes and soy.

86
00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:34.610
Yeah.

87
00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:40.610
And Shuffer, Mr. Wills wants to add that Mrs. Miller gets car sick on long brights.

88
00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:43.759
Then we'll arrange a private jet for her.

89
00:06:43.759 --> 00:06:46.759
Whenever she needs to travel long distances.

90
00:06:46.759 --> 00:06:49.759
Is he trying to get to know me better?

91
00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:59.230
So, I didn't think you could have this only.

92
00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:04.699
I promise you're going to love breakfast this morning.

93
00:07:04.699 --> 00:07:08.699
I think it's better to come and just talk to him.

94
00:07:08.699 --> 00:07:12.379
I need to talk to you about...

95
00:07:12.379 --> 00:07:14.379
that ashes the thing.

96
00:07:14.379 --> 00:07:15.379
How about that?

97
00:07:15.379 --> 00:07:17.379
You don't have worry at all.

98
00:07:17.379 --> 00:07:19.379
I've got to everything out of it.

99
00:07:19.379 --> 00:07:21.379
I don't need you making arrangements for me.

100
00:07:21.379 --> 00:07:24.379
Especially without asking for my opinion first.

101
00:07:24.379 --> 00:07:26.379
But I know you.

102
00:07:26.379 --> 00:07:29.379
And therefore, I know what you want.

103
00:07:29.379 --> 00:07:30.379
You don't know me.

104
00:07:30.379 --> 00:07:32.379
You've never known for all these years.

105
00:07:32.379 --> 00:07:35.779
That's unfair.

106
00:07:35.779 --> 00:07:37.819
I do know you.

107
00:07:37.819 --> 00:07:43.600
I know you like it when I kiss you in the neck.

108
00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:49.480
That you have a mole under your collarbone.

109
00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:53.629
You always love when I touch your belly.

110
00:07:53.629 --> 00:07:58.339
I know that your waist is your most sensitive spot.

111
00:07:58.339 --> 00:08:02.649
That you can be too vocal.

112
00:08:02.649 --> 00:08:05.649
And you do love when I grab your hips.

113
00:08:05.649 --> 00:08:10.279
Every time you do it, you have to do it multiple times

114
00:08:10.279 --> 00:08:13.279
because you want more and more.

115
00:08:13.279 --> 00:08:18.720
And I like it when you say these words to me.

116
00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.300
I thought we were only doing it

117
00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:25.899
because of that stupid agreement we made.

118
00:08:25.899 --> 00:08:29.100
Who do you remember all these details so clearly?

119
00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:32.100
I did think it was just a marital duty at first,

120
00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:37.090
but my body always knew it before my heart did.

121
00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:40.820
You know what?

122
00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:54.340
The only woman I love is.

123
00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:56.340
Montezinger's agent is on the phone.

124
00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:58.340
Asking for Mrs. Miller.

125
00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:01.710
Is this for real?

126
00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:03.710
Montezinger, he's my idol.

127
00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:06.159
Then you should take this call.

128
00:09:06.159 --> 00:09:46.080
I'm sorry.

129
00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:48.080
I need some time to think about it.

130
00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:59.620
I want to know what Patrick thinks about this tour,

131
00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:03.620
but I also need to figure out why I hate Isaac's identity.

132
00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:05.620
Just me and you're finally here.

133
00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:08.059
I really live in the company.

134
00:10:08.059 --> 00:10:11.379
Living wherever to say that.

135
00:10:11.379 --> 00:10:13.379
Your office was emptied earlier this morning.

136
00:10:13.379 --> 00:10:15.379
They said your plan to resign.

137
00:10:15.379 --> 00:10:17.740
Who said that?

138
00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:20.629
Now that she's the famous artist,

139
00:10:20.629 --> 00:10:22.629
we bother with a job.

140
00:10:22.629 --> 00:10:24.629
We need to capitalize on her immediately

141
00:10:24.629 --> 00:10:26.629
and benefit the Miller family.

142
00:10:26.629 --> 00:10:43.289
Mrs. Miller left.

143
00:10:43.289 --> 00:10:45.450
She looked very upset.

144
00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:49.779
This pretending,

145
00:10:49.779 --> 00:10:52.070
why did you have to do that?

146
00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:55.070
You two were so close to finally making up.

147
00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:58.070
You know, the last couple of days I was wondering,

148
00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:01.419
why should he hate Isaac's identity?

149
00:11:01.419 --> 00:11:05.220
Until last night, I found the latter.

150
00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:07.220
My grandfather left me in the study.

151
00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:10.820
Did Mr. Sharon with you?

152
00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:11.820
My work.

153
00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:12.820
I'm not in the mood.

154
00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:15.330
You all right?

155
00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:19.889
My grandfather's will.

156
00:11:19.889 --> 00:11:20.889
He left an old room,

157
00:11:20.889 --> 00:11:23.889
requiring me to get married to inherit the company.

158
00:11:23.889 --> 00:11:28.000
I'm willing to marry you.

159
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:34.539
I mean, we can get divorced after he will inherit the company.

160
00:11:34.539 --> 00:11:38.740
There is another rule.

161
00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:41.870
My wife can never have any job outside the Miller company.

162
00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:44.610
Are you willing to do that?

163
00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:49.539
Sure.

164
00:11:49.539 --> 00:11:57.399
I don't have any job anyway,

165
00:11:57.399 --> 00:12:00.399
and being a wealthy housewife sounds like a dream.

166
00:12:00.399 --> 00:12:05.039
My grandfather's letter said that he investigated Jasmine

167
00:12:05.039 --> 00:12:07.039
in his final days,

168
00:12:07.039 --> 00:12:10.039
and he discovered her hidden identity.

169
00:12:10.039 --> 00:12:13.039
He asked me to cherish the girl who gave up everything for me,

170
00:12:13.039 --> 00:12:19.019
but I never saw that letter until now.

171
00:12:19.019 --> 00:12:22.340
All those years I generally thought,

172
00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:26.429
she just married me to be a rich housewife.

173
00:12:26.429 --> 00:12:27.429
Wow.

174
00:12:27.429 --> 00:12:33.190
I can't believe Mrs. Miller gave up her career year for you.

175
00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:34.190
Yes.

176
00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:39.539
That's why this time I have to make sure she reaches the place she deserves.

177
00:12:39.539 --> 00:12:42.539
Even if it means I have to let her go.

178
00:12:42.539 --> 00:12:45.230
I'm not pregnant.

179
00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:46.230
Am I?

180
00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:47.230
Thank God.

181
00:12:47.230 --> 00:13:35.159
I can't even wish you terms like this.

182
00:13:35.159 --> 00:13:42.350
Does she didn't care about me at all?

183
00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:44.350
I wish I hadn't married you.

184
00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:45.830
Hi, it's Isaac.

185
00:13:45.830 --> 00:14:08.799
I would be honored to join Mr. C. in our history.

186
00:14:08.799 --> 00:14:09.799
Goodbye Jasmine.

187
00:14:09.799 --> 00:14:25.370
By the truth.

188
00:14:25.370 --> 00:15:01.299
By the end of this tour she'll be a household name.

189
00:15:01.299 --> 00:15:06.679
Seems like I was the only one not to see how special she was.

190
00:15:06.679 --> 00:15:08.679
I'll be right back, okay?

191
00:15:08.679 --> 00:15:13.580
I actually thought you guys would get back together.

192
00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:18.669
Don't you think she'd rather pursue her career than be with a fool like me?

193
00:15:18.669 --> 00:15:21.669
Don't think those are incompatible.

194
00:15:21.669 --> 00:15:22.669
Tell me.

195
00:15:22.669 --> 00:15:23.669
Thanks.

196
00:15:23.669 --> 00:15:28.559
She's meant to be a great artist.

197
00:15:28.559 --> 00:15:30.559
I can't get in her way anymore.

198
00:15:30.559 --> 00:15:32.559
You're finally looking out for her.

199
00:15:32.559 --> 00:15:33.559
Hey.

200
00:15:33.559 --> 00:15:34.559
What's up?

201
00:15:34.559 --> 00:15:42.659
What?

202
00:15:42.659 --> 00:15:43.659
You're a prick?

203
00:15:43.659 --> 00:15:45.850
Phibs.

204
00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:46.850
Is Jasmine?

205
00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:47.850
Is everything okay?

206
00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:48.940
Call your right back.

207
00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:49.940
What?

208
00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:51.009
So it's Jasmine.

209
00:15:51.009 --> 00:15:52.009
She's...

210
00:15:52.009 --> 00:15:55.440
And?

211
00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:56.440
Tell me.

212
00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:57.440
I don't know what to say.

213
00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:01.210
I just really hope you guys figure everything out.

214
00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:03.210
I can't figure her out.

215
00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:05.210
You've seen her attitude towards me.

216
00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:07.210
God damn amnesia.

217
00:16:07.210 --> 00:16:08.210
What?

218
00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:16.789
Well, you know, after that car accident, her memory has reverted back when she was 21,

219
00:16:16.789 --> 00:16:18.789
and she doesn't remember anything about your relationship.

220
00:16:18.789 --> 00:16:22.789
No wonder she was acting as a different person.

221
00:16:22.789 --> 00:16:24.789
So the accident was real?

222
00:16:24.789 --> 00:16:27.529
We didn't know that.

223
00:16:27.529 --> 00:16:32.360
I just was thinking that she tried to get my attention.

224
00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:33.360
You know what?

225
00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:35.940
Take her to the hospital.

226
00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:41.659
Her current condition requires a full body checkup.

227
00:16:42.659 --> 00:16:43.659
Thank you Phibs.

228
00:16:43.659 --> 00:16:46.009
We'll take a good care of her.

229
00:16:46.009 --> 00:16:47.039
Jasmine.

230
00:16:47.039 --> 00:16:57.899
I'm sorry I made a decision for you, but I really think your baby needs a father.

231
00:16:57.899 --> 00:16:59.899
Should I tell Patrick I'm pregnant?

232
00:16:59.899 --> 00:17:05.799
So you should definitely tell him.

233
00:17:05.799 --> 00:17:06.799
We're over.

234
00:17:06.799 --> 00:17:12.269
And one of the first things is just because of the baby.

235
00:17:12.269 --> 00:17:14.589
And you don't have to be together.

236
00:17:14.589 --> 00:17:16.690
But he has the right to know.

237
00:17:16.690 --> 00:17:17.690
I need to.

238
00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:19.690
I'm kind of freaking out.

239
00:17:19.690 --> 00:17:25.529
Everything will be fine.

240
00:17:25.529 --> 00:17:26.529
I'll be with you.

241
00:17:26.529 --> 00:17:30.529
And besides, you've always loved kids, right?

242
00:17:30.529 --> 00:17:35.710
Maybe go to the hospital and get a checkup purse.

243
00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:37.710
Oh, Patrick's here.

244
00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:52.859
I only get to alone.

245
00:17:52.859 --> 00:17:53.859
I'm sorry.

246
00:17:53.859 --> 00:18:02.240
I wish I could have known this all there.

247
00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:03.240
What?

248
00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:04.240
You know?

249
00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:06.240
I was too ignorant.

250
00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:08.980
I should have realized it sooner.

251
00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:12.490
Let's just go to the hospital and put a checkup.

252
00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:16.220
I don't know how I feel about this situation.

253
00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:20.880
Consider it when we are.

254
00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:21.880
No, no, no.

255
00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:23.069
Don't overthink.

256
00:18:23.069 --> 00:18:25.069
I'll take full responsibility.

257
00:18:25.069 --> 00:18:30.230
Just because he's not a good husband, doesn't mean he's not going to be a good father.

258
00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:31.230
All right.

259
00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:32.230
Let's go.

260
00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:35.700
What seems to be the problem?

261
00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:46.769
Let's start with a full body checkup.

262
00:18:46.769 --> 00:18:50.170
Listen.

263
00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:52.170
Focus on examining her.

264
00:18:52.170 --> 00:19:01.829
My wife has symptoms of amnesia.

265
00:19:01.829 --> 00:19:04.930
Let's do a city's kind of her brain.

266
00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:06.930
We got the results.

267
00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:12.339
I wish she.

268
00:19:12.339 --> 00:19:14.569
But while amnesia was caused by the accident,

269
00:19:14.569 --> 00:19:18.700
she has clearly experienced severe psychological trauma prior to it.

270
00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:25.920
This has led to selective amnesia where she forgets only her most painful experiences.

271
00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:28.920
She has forgotten everything but with our marriage.

272
00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:34.049
So you're saying, I'm basically the source of her pain.

273
00:19:34.049 --> 00:19:36.049
You can put it that way.

274
00:19:36.049 --> 00:19:39.720
I know it's not easy to comprehend.

275
00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:40.720
Oh, wait, wait.

276
00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:50.019
Your wife's pregnant?

277
00:19:50.019 --> 00:19:53.539
Good news.

278
00:19:53.539 --> 00:19:56.920
Your pregnancy is going really well.

279
00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:58.920
You and your husband can rest assured.

280
00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:05.470
I just don't really know where he wants to be a father.

281
00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:12.890
I can tell Ikyra's about you a lot.

282
00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:14.890
He'll be a great father.

283
00:20:14.890 --> 00:20:17.299
I have something to tell you.

284
00:20:17.299 --> 00:20:30.369
Me too.

285
00:20:30.369 --> 00:20:36.250
Isn't this the divorce agreement I left for you?

286
00:20:36.250 --> 00:20:37.250
Yes.

287
00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:40.789
If you say no, it's official over.

288
00:20:40.789 --> 00:20:47.500
So, he really doesn't want the baby?

289
00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:52.390
I'm sorry for all the pain I've caused you.

290
00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:56.220
Perhaps letting go is the best thing I can do for you.

291
00:20:56.220 --> 00:21:02.170
So, that's what you've been thinking about.

292
00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:04.359
I get it now.

293
00:21:04.359 --> 00:21:12.539
You take care of yourself.

294
00:21:12.539 --> 00:21:15.019
I'm sorry, little legend.

295
00:21:23.789 --> 00:21:24.789
I'm sorry, little legend.

296
00:21:24.789 --> 00:21:27.180
It looks like it just...

297
00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:35.829
You and me for now on.

298
00:21:35.829 --> 00:21:36.829
Patrick.

299
00:21:36.829 --> 00:21:37.829
Avial?

300
00:21:37.829 --> 00:21:38.829
What are you doing here?

301
00:21:38.829 --> 00:21:39.829
I need your help.

302
00:21:39.829 --> 00:21:43.829
My restaurant went bankrupt and I have so much doubt that the bank is threatening me.

303
00:21:43.829 --> 00:21:44.829
And I...

304
00:21:44.829 --> 00:21:46.829
Haven't I given you enough money?

305
00:21:46.829 --> 00:21:47.829
Oh.

306
00:21:47.829 --> 00:21:49.829
But of course you want more.

307
00:21:49.829 --> 00:21:50.829
No, no, Patrick.

308
00:21:50.829 --> 00:21:53.829
You promised my grandpa you took care of me for a life, please.

309
00:21:53.829 --> 00:21:56.829
Listen, if I help you now, you'll never grow up.

310
00:21:56.829 --> 00:22:00.410
It's time for you to deal with this when you're all...

311
00:22:00.410 --> 00:22:02.410
No, Patrick.

312
00:22:02.410 --> 00:22:04.410
No, please.

313
00:22:04.410 --> 00:22:06.180
Fine.

314
00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:10.180
If you push me out of your life, then we'll all go down together.

315
00:22:33.039 --> 00:22:36.039
Isaac, my sister is a huge fan.

316
00:22:36.039 --> 00:22:39.039
She has a disability and is having surgery tomorrow.

317
00:22:39.039 --> 00:22:42.029
Could you please just meet her?

318
00:22:42.029 --> 00:22:43.029
Of course I can.

319
00:22:43.029 --> 00:22:44.029
Where is she?

320
00:22:44.029 --> 00:22:45.029
I'll show you.

321
00:22:45.029 --> 00:22:48.369
I'm sorry.

322
00:22:48.369 --> 00:22:57.380
Why is this isn't here?

323
00:22:57.380 --> 00:22:58.380
She can't walk well.

324
00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:00.380
She's waiting up at the air.

325
00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:32.390
I'm pregnant with Patrick's child.

326
00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:34.539
Oh, please.

327
00:23:34.539 --> 00:23:36.539
Don't hurt my baby.

328
00:23:36.539 --> 00:23:38.539
Oh, how naive you are.

329
00:23:38.539 --> 00:24:03.529
None of us are living a lie.

330
00:24:03.529 --> 00:24:05.589
Something happened to Jasmine.

331
00:24:05.589 --> 00:24:06.589
I need to find her.

332
00:24:06.589 --> 00:24:11.190
I'll wash longer until we can locate her.

333
00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:12.190
Oh, there.

334
00:24:12.190 --> 00:24:14.769
The signal from the ship is too weak.

335
00:24:14.769 --> 00:24:18.859
Also, where did you place it on Mrs. Miller, sir?

336
00:24:18.859 --> 00:24:19.859
The last time.

337
00:24:19.859 --> 00:24:23.910
The last time I saw her at the hospital.

338
00:24:23.910 --> 00:24:26.910
This is our hospital's latest technology.

339
00:24:26.910 --> 00:24:31.910
On place over the pulse it can monitor patients' health status at all times and even share their

340
00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:32.910
location.

341
00:24:32.910 --> 00:24:35.910
But it comes with a price tag of $1 million.

342
00:24:35.910 --> 00:24:39.420
I'll take it.

343
00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:41.509
Put this into her wash, please.

344
00:24:41.509 --> 00:24:43.509
Bingo, we've located her.

345
00:24:43.509 --> 00:24:46.059
She's near a jug yard.

346
00:24:46.059 --> 00:25:16.269
Thank you more than this.

347
00:25:16.269 --> 00:25:43.039
Give our baby.

348
00:25:43.039 --> 00:25:45.900
And I'll forgive myself for this.

349
00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:49.099
How could I let you and our child be in such danger?

350
00:25:50.099 --> 00:25:51.099
Please.

351
00:25:51.099 --> 00:25:53.380
Please.

352
00:25:53.380 --> 00:26:07.460
Careful.

353
00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:11.150
Oh, wow.

354
00:26:11.150 --> 00:26:12.150
So we want to play the hero?

355
00:26:12.150 --> 00:26:13.150
Fine.

356
00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:15.500
Then you don't have to leave either.

357
00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:16.500
Behind you!

358
00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:29.059
What do we do?

359
00:26:29.059 --> 00:26:31.059
He'll print the desk in there.

360
00:26:31.059 --> 00:26:32.059
Don't worry.

361
00:26:32.059 --> 00:26:35.059
I'm tracking the Throx route to Sane Conamoy to intercept.

362
00:26:35.059 --> 00:26:36.059
It's heading.

363
00:26:36.059 --> 00:26:37.059
It's just past Park Avenue.

364
00:26:37.059 --> 00:26:55.720
Hey, girl.

365
00:26:55.720 --> 00:27:02.000
Say no more.

366
00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000
We're on this.

367
00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:49.269
What are this crazy fucks doing?

368
00:27:49.269 --> 00:27:51.269
Doctor, he's been unconscious for a whole day.

369
00:27:51.269 --> 00:27:52.269
When will he wake her?

370
00:27:52.269 --> 00:27:54.269
His vital signs are stable.

371
00:27:54.269 --> 00:27:57.269
If he wakes up tonight, there shouldn't be any issues.

372
00:27:57.269 --> 00:27:58.269
But if he doesn't...

373
00:27:58.269 --> 00:28:00.269
No, he will wake up.

374
00:28:00.269 --> 00:28:01.269
He has to.

375
00:28:01.269 --> 00:28:03.269
I can assure you we're doing our best.

376
00:28:03.269 --> 00:28:10.180
If it's something I've kept from you for so long,

377
00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:14.410
I actually lost my memory and I don't remember much about us.

378
00:28:14.410 --> 00:28:24.220
People kept saying we were unhappy together, but when you said you loved me the last time,

379
00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:27.279
it felt so real.

380
00:28:27.279 --> 00:28:31.019
I've been lacking my feelings to what repeated in the past,

381
00:28:31.019 --> 00:28:33.019
but I can't seem to stop laughing at you.

382
00:28:33.019 --> 00:28:35.619
And you're right.

383
00:28:35.619 --> 00:28:39.390
I don't love it when you kiss my neck.

384
00:28:39.390 --> 00:28:48.980
When you hold me close and all of this...

385
00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:50.980
This is... this is our baby.

386
00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:55.779
You can't leave him without a father.

387
00:28:55.779 --> 00:29:32.210
I love you, Patrick.

388
00:29:32.210 --> 00:29:36.500
It's me.

389
00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:40.359
Well, I... I don't believe that.

390
00:29:40.359 --> 00:29:43.000
Don't lie to me.

391
00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.259
I don't remember you at all.

392
00:29:45.259 --> 00:29:48.259
We've been through so much together.

393
00:29:48.259 --> 00:29:49.259
How could you forget?

394
00:29:49.259 --> 00:29:52.740
So much like... like what?

395
00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:57.970
I don't know where to start.

396
00:29:57.970 --> 00:30:01.509
Please, you can't forget everything.

397
00:30:01.509 --> 00:30:03.509
Just as I start to remember things.

398
00:30:03.509 --> 00:30:11.940
So you were saying that I'm your husband and you were in love with me?

399
00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:13.940
Of course I am.

400
00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:15.940
I love you, Patrick Miller.

401
00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:27.839
I want to spend life with you, even if you don't remember me.

402
00:30:27.839 --> 00:30:31.029
You said it. You can never back out.

403
00:30:31.029 --> 00:30:37.539
You bragged me.

404
00:30:37.539 --> 00:30:40.539
How can I hear your confession otherwise?

405
00:30:40.539 --> 00:30:46.109
You know, you scared the hell out of me.

406
00:30:46.109 --> 00:30:52.180
I'm never letting you live my side again.

407
00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:56.759
Then, from now on, we should always be together.

408
00:30:56.759 --> 00:31:00.170
I thought in from this very moment.
