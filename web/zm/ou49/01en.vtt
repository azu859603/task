00:00:05.459 --> 00:00:07.960
Are you okay?

2
00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.179
I'm okay.

3
00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:12.179
I'm okay.

4
00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.779
I'm okay.

5
00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:15.279
I'm okay.

6
00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:17.789
I don't understand its thinking.

7
00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.890
Why don't you imagine a person in your room?

8
00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.750
They said, though, they want...

9
00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.100
I'm okay.

10
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.719
What?

11
00:00:28.719 --> 00:00:33.039
That's the story of the dogs?

12
00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:35.039
Some dogs?

13
00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:37.039
They got a little science.

14
00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:40.899
And that is a challenge for us,

15
00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:42.649
as we as Nus koto.

16
00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:44.009
And as we as a leader,

17
00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:47.350
we have to be the only one who is familiar

18
00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.380
as a special topic in which we have a magnate of architects.

19
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:53.939
What is it?

20
00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:54.659
Aă?

21
00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:55.579
Aă?

22
00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:02.609
Aă?

23
00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.799
But again, it was a long time ago,

24
00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:08.640
this is an exact thing,

25
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.560
no, no more.

26
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.599
That's not because I parody the other one,

27
00:01:12.599 --> 00:01:14.120
We've never had a child.

28
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.439
Anyways, it's all about it.

29
00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:17.040
I'll be back again soon.

30
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.680
I'll be back with you today.

31
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:25.170
I'll be back with you later.

32
00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.209
I'll be back with you later.

33
00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:28.290
I'll be back.

34
00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.849
I'll be back with you later.

35
00:01:30.849 --> 00:01:34.349
I'll be back with you later.
