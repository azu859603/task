00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.189
What do you mean?

2
00:00:02.189 --> 00:00:04.190
I'm sorry, what's wrong?

3
00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:09.839
I don't know.

4
00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:10.839
I'm afraid.

5
00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:15.339
What do you mean?

6
00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:17.339
What is wrong?

7
00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:19.339
I'm afraid.

8
00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:21.339
I'm afraid.

9
00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:22.339
I'm afraid.

10
00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:25.339
I'm afraid.

11
00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:28.100
What are you doing?

12
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.100
What is wrong?

13
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.100
What do you mean?

14
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.100
What do you mean?

15
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.159
How come this was important to people?

16
00:00:36.159 --> 00:00:39.659
Because it's a lesson to all these people.

17
00:00:39.659 --> 00:00:43.420
I think it's important to realize that this is a lesson like this.

18
00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.969
Because it's the first time we have to speak,

19
00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:47.929
but it's the first time I've seen it.

20
00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:49.810
That could be true, but it is.

21
00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.289
And you decided to start learning?

22
00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.469
But you don't know about it.

23
00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:55.899
They start learning to say something like that.

24
00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:57.109
I said,

25
00:00:57.109 --> 00:00:59.310
I'm not going to not answer that.

26
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.590
I'm talking a lot about it because it's something you can't say.

27
00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.230
But I'm not going to school like this.

28
00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.230
Kate, you're not a saint.

29
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:08.230
I'm not a saint.

30
00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:10.230
I'm not a saint.

31
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.230
I'm not a saint.

32
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:23.379
You're a saint.

33
00:01:23.379 --> 00:01:25.379
I can't say anything.

34
00:01:25.379 --> 00:01:29.400
I'm a saint.

35
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.840
You're a saint.
