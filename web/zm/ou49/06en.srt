00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,700
You have to say the answer.

00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:07,450
I'm not an Teams, but of course I'm not an Growing up!

00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:13,349
But you've lost me in the end.

4
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:18,730
If you could pass me away, I'd be afraid that you would not be afraid of being gay.

5
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:19,609
I'm not afraid yourself.

But I'm glad you guys are so proud of us.

00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,250
I love the emblems and emotions that are so effective for me.

8
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,050
I'm so glad you're all in love!

00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:31,289
I have been born in this world for too long.

10
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:33,310
What is your favorite thing?

11
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:35,250
What are you talking about?

Yes, I have no direction.

13
00:00:36,929 --> 00:00:39,090
I have no direction, I have no direction.

14
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:40,869
I have no direction.

15
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:49,659
What do you mean?

16
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:50,920
I have no direction.

17
00:00:50,979 --> 00:00:54,979
I have no direction.

18
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,340
I am very happy that I have no direction.

19
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,100
