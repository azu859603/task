00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:05,719
No, they are not very interested in that, my parents were not very interested in that.

2
00:00:05,719 --> 00:00:09,310
I don't know what to say but I don't know.

3
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:17,420
I don't know what to say.

4
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:20,239
I'm not really sure how much you can do.

5
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:25,379
I can't tell, I'm not a university, I'm not a university.

6
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:30,579
I don't know, but I don't know how to say the same thing.

7
00:00:30,579 --> 00:00:34,039
I think that's why I am so interested in this.

8
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:34,859
You name it!

9
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:36,780
I have a question now.

10
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,439
Do you ever know this story?

11
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:42,380
See if we make a tune of our new tweeting section below.

12
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,619
Can you tell us a little bit?

13
00:00:45,619 --> 00:00:46,880
Do you like some books?

14
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:49,189
I'm sorry, am I here now?

15
00:00:49,189 --> 00:00:51,229
Yes, I'm not a real person.

16
00:00:51,229 --> 00:00:53,149
You're not a supertor.

17
00:00:53,149 --> 00:00:54,850
Do you know that I'm familiar with you?

18
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:58,350
Yes, I think you are a lot of people.

19
00:00:59,149 --> 00:01:14,120
Do you understand that I really push you?

20
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,120
Mea?

21
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,120
You miss mea?

22
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,120
Mea?

23
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,030
Do you know Naika?
