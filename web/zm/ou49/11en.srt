1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:02,270
Oh shiny.

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:04,309
You have a friend who got left?

3
00:00:04,309 --> 00:00:06,250
What's the matter?

4
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:07,849
Why do I do this?

5
00:00:07,849 --> 00:00:09,869
Because I don't have a friend.

6
00:00:09,869 --> 00:00:12,400
You have a friend in my career.

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,359
Is it a direct debt?

8
00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:16,820
You have a member who has a friend in your life.

9
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,100
You have an entree.

10
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:34,020
You have a friend who comes here to see you right?

11
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,780
Oh, Bottom Brand, the second one,

12
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:46,950
the owner of the treasure registers.

13
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:47,750
Where are they hiding?

14
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:50,369
I had a friend who is missing out on me.

15
00:00:50,369 --> 00:00:59,600
You had a friend who is missing out on me.

16
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,600
I got a friend here.

17
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,439
Okay, don't miss this.

18
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:12,250
John, don't just and you can't just have any warning.

19
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:15,290
It doesn't mean I was to look up a little but I'm supposed to have an idea.

20
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:18,159
Uh, No, no, no, it's perhaps I have no idea.

21
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,159
You know what?

22
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:20,859
It's just to be a little bit cryo.

23
00:01:20,859 --> 00:01:22,859
No no much as I am.

24
00:01:22,859 --> 00:01:24,859
I am not going to do it because I'm serious.

25
00:01:24,859 --> 00:01:27,959
On this day's weather and I can make a lot of these.

26
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:33,359
I don't know how I am, but I just think I'm going to be a lot more than me.

27
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:37,859
Why don't you tell me why he is just not here.

28
00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:41,930
I guess he doesn't stop saying that.

29
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:44,629
I see a good feeling of that.

30
00:01:44,629 --> 00:01:46,329
Oh, and he lost my son's heart.

31
00:01:46,329 --> 00:01:47,629
He's lost me.

32
00:01:47,629 --> 00:01:48,730
What are you doing in this world?

33
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:50,030
No.

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,700
That's strange.

35
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,799
To be honest, that's a very strange area.

36
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:56,299
I don't know.

37
00:01:56,299 --> 00:02:01,290
But I have to be honest, because I'm gonna put on this kind of topic.

38
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:04,590
No, I'm gonna be honest if you want to be honest but not positive.

39
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,129
Isn't this a good idea?

40
00:02:06,129 --> 00:02:08,289
and I'm coming to the end of the day.

41
00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:09,870
I've been well after my older life.

42
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:12,330
I've been that young girl.

43
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:14,030
I've been that young girl.

44
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:17,259
I've been that young girl.

45
00:02:17,259 --> 00:02:19,699
I'm so glad that I'm here.

46
00:02:19,699 --> 00:02:22,860
You're the first to know someone who has been in a situation.

47
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,060
I'm just a good girl.

48
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,979
You're the first to know someone who has been in a situation

49
00:02:26,979 --> 00:02:28,800
where you can do something like this.

50
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,969
And then, the first to know something,

51
00:02:33,969 --> 00:02:38,189
you can do something yourself.

52
00:02:38,189 --> 00:02:40,180
You're the only one with me.

53
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,300
Never that.

54
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,300
I don't think I can do anything but me.

55
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,300
Ah, see.

56
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:47,319
Gracias.

57
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:48,319
Gracias.

58
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:18,639
Hey, son.

59
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:19,639
Hey.

60
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:20,639
Hey, right.

61
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:51,580
the game god's.

62
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:52,620
Eo Ido ke la Señorita cox,

she'll always be that.

00:03:58,259 --> 00:03:59,280

Mo chapi de rizprayudame, seño.

Herizun, chase, herizun, polegema me chase.

75
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:48,980
We don't want to talk about this, we don't want to talk about it, but it's not enough to have a

76
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:53,920
Enjoy the time!

77
00:04:53,920 --> 00:05:01,350
Cool, have a good day.

78
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:03,449
Hello everyone!

79
00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:05,430
Let's see what happens in the video.

80
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,389
We'll go now.

81
00:05:07,389 --> 00:05:10,329
You can film some of the material as well.

82
00:05:10,329 --> 00:05:12,689
I've also been doing it technically.

83
00:05:12,689 --> 00:05:15,410
It would be nice if you could film a video?

84
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:17,170
Yes.

85
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:19,509
I'm crazy too.

86
00:05:19,509 --> 00:05:21,529
Do you like it or have a video?

87
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:23,269
Do you like it?

88
00:05:23,269 --> 00:05:27,709
And now she knows we can run through the

89
00:05:27,709 --> 00:05:29,649
hands of the new members of the city.

90
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:31,930
We have the possibility to protect

91
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:32,810
themselves from the darkness.

92
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:34,050
We have to know that we can

93
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:35,810
decide to get that right.

94
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:36,810
The moment all is dead,

95
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:37,970
we have to think so.

96
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,560
This is the time you have to go in

97
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,720
the streets of the city.

98
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,319
Then we will be the first city to

99
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:45,220
open in the city of the world

100
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:45,939
and in other services that we have

101
00:05:45,939 --> 00:05:47,759
to make sure if the city has

102
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,300
been sent to the city

103
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,220
there are two ways to decide

104
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,519
how many words to let go.

105
00:05:52,519 --> 00:06:38,079
Well, these are all the best things in the world.

106
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,060
Are you wowah?

107
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,480
I like it and you're really joking.

108
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,470
It is the best place we have ever been?

109
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:44,079
There's a lot of people.

110
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:45,579
Are you surprised?

111
00:06:45,579 --> 00:06:48,759
But when we were in the market I had a good time.

112
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:51,220
And what was that?

113
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,160
Already.

114
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,810
And you're very careful.

115
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:56,810
Hmm.

116
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:59,160
I'm a fun and necessary.

117
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,399
But when you are in the interest world,

118
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:02,860
you're going to be able to find a world

119
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:06,579
that has no tax due to this part of your experience.

120
00:07:06,579 --> 00:07:13,550
I'm not sure what I'm doing here, but also what I'm doing here is that I'm standing on the left side of the street

121
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:19,879
and I'm just looking forward to the next step that I'm going to be going to the next step

122
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:23,220
and I'm looking forward to places where I'm going to work again

123
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:27,459
I'm going to go to the next step that I want to work on

124
00:07:27,459 --> 00:07:28,980
And what are you doing here?

125
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:33,629
You're doing great. I'm doing great. I'm going to work here.

126
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,779
Let's go.

127
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,500
Let's go.

128
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,670
did you order to go here for the last time?

129
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:42,870
would you like to visit me?

130
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:45,189
no, you don't know about this anymore

131
00:07:45,189 --> 00:07:47,509
I thought I'd be the first to know

132
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:50,300
you want to meet Elento

133
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,860
I'll got money back in the morning

134
00:07:52,860 --> 00:08:05,329
I'll have a year for you

135
00:08:05,329 --> 00:08:06,329
that's fine

136
00:08:06,329 --> 00:08:08,930
we will get our own SHEKOS

137
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:12,990
never done this

138
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:14,389
where we can see her

139
00:08:14,389 --> 00:08:23,259
yes, it's the same trend

140
00:08:23,259 --> 00:08:24,579
yes, except the other side

141
00:08:24,579 --> 00:08:27,540
that's the same and the other side

142
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,540
that's the first time

143
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,740
We've been without you!

144
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:36,879
We're just gonna be the first to play in the game game!

145
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:40,019
Only if you play in the game!

146
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,639
You don't have to do that.

147
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:45,200
You don't want to do this.

148
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,159
You don't have to take me in the game game!

149
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:49,960
Here's the story!

150
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,399
Your voice is so beautiful!

151
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,649
All of these stories are from the beginning of the game!

152
00:08:55,649 --> 00:08:58,669
It was no matter if you were in a game game!

153
00:08:58,669 --> 00:09:01,889
And I would say that you can play in the game game

154
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:38,259
We will have the right to think about the same abilities we have.

155
00:09:38,259 --> 00:09:42,779
We need to take care of the same abilities we have to make this out of the way.

156
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:43,779
What's wrong?

157
00:09:43,779 --> 00:09:57,799
We have to go.

158
00:09:57,799 --> 00:10:01,620
We have to go.

159
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,620
I'm not afraid of you.

160
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,730
You're not afraid of us.

161
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:11,730
I don't think anyone has to worry about us, but I feel that we are just going to be in this

162
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:12,730
way.

163
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:16,830
I don't think we can do anything more than this.

164
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:18,830
You know, Ciantos and your soldiers

165
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:20,830
And I can't remember

166
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:23,269
But...

167
00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:33,139
Kate!

168
00:10:33,139 --> 00:10:38,340
I'm not just a genius

169
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,340
So you can do it

170
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:42,460
What do you mean

171
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,460
Well, you can do it

172
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:47,460
I know, that's the most beautiful thing

173
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,620
I've ever seen

174
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,620
You know, I love you

175
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:54,620
But you don't have to be a genius

176
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,620
I don't have to be a genius

177
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,620
You're just a genius

178
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,620
I don't know.

179
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,620
I know that, that is something I can do,

180
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,620
but I want to make a decision.

181
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,620
But it is hard to remember.

182
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:29,539
All the money I can do,

183
00:11:29,539 --> 00:11:30,539
so I'm going to try.

184
00:11:30,539 --> 00:11:35,059
And I'm going to try the money.

185
00:11:35,059 --> 00:11:37,159
And I'm going to try the money.

186
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:39,159
And I'm going to try the money.

187
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:42,379
Oh, dear.

188
00:11:42,379 --> 00:11:44,379
How are you?

189
00:11:44,379 --> 00:11:48,080
I'm going to try the money.

190
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,080
I'm going to try the money for you.

191
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,080
At the end of the day,

192
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,080
I'm going to try the money for you.

193
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,080
A number of people.

194
00:11:57,039 --> 00:11:58,039
Yeah, but what I do?

195
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,960
What are in the heart of technology,

196
00:12:01,419 --> 00:12:03,419
what do you do?

197
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,679
What are you going to do?

198
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,100
Get this person.

199
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,080
It's hard.

200
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,440
I like it because there's a lot of people.

201
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,120
Do you think people like those who live here?

202
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,929
Don't say that and what else?

203
00:12:19,289 --> 00:12:21,230
I think the day has happened,

204
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,889
so we have the opportunity

205
00:12:22,889 --> 00:12:25,610
to talk to people who live on the other side.

206
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:30,169
We're working with the EU and the EU and we're creating a new and alive political participation

207
00:12:30,169 --> 00:12:32,730
and the attitude we've been doing to achieve this.

208
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:36,299
I'm not sure that we're going to win the first round of the game.

209
00:12:36,299 --> 00:12:40,080
I don't know if I can even do this to you.

210
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,460
I'm a hot guy.

211
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:46,049
That's what you're doing.

212
00:12:46,049 --> 00:12:46,309
What?

213
00:12:46,309 --> 00:12:46,850
What?

214
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:47,309
What?

215
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:48,529
What?

216
00:12:48,529 --> 00:12:48,970
What?

217
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:49,370
What are you doing?

218
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:50,049
What are you doing?

219
00:12:50,049 --> 00:12:51,289
What's the problem with the real world?

220
00:12:51,289 --> 00:12:55,309
What's the problem with the real world that we have to do?

221
00:12:55,309 --> 00:13:01,090
What's the problem with the real world?

222
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,139
It's the real world.

223
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,559
There it is, so interesting!

224
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:50,340
Ahhh!

225
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:53,799
You can't be alone though, if you want to stay with me.

226
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:57,870
Yes, I imagine you have a bad mood,

227
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:01,470
and I'm not the best one to know about you.

228
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:12,789
I'm not the best, but I'm not the good one.

229
00:14:12,789 --> 00:14:14,820
Let's go.

230
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:15,820
Hey, hey, hey!

231
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,409
Come on, Dad!

232
00:14:17,409 --> 00:14:19,090
Good to see you, too!

233
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:21,809
And don't words to be named Badoc.

234
00:14:21,809 --> 00:14:28,710
Badoc.

235
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:29,809
Badoc!

236
00:14:29,809 --> 00:14:30,570
Badoc.

237
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:31,490
You want a boo?

238
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:32,490
Badoc.

239
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:33,570
Badoc.

240
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:53,840
I think this is a great idea.

241
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:55,000
You can tell us.

242
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,149
We were in the house.

243
00:14:58,539 --> 00:15:00,220
I didn't know.

244
00:15:00,379 --> 00:15:03,500
I thought it was illegal to be here.

245
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:08,980
We were in the house.

246
00:15:09,139 --> 00:15:10,779
And I was in the house.

247
00:15:10,779 --> 00:15:14,379
He just wanted to go.

248
00:15:14,419 --> 00:15:16,580
He wanted to be a good father.

249
00:15:18,149 --> 00:15:28,690
I thought I was a good father.

250
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:32,179
It was my father's father.

251
00:15:32,179 --> 00:15:43,889
And what happened to him now that I'm a principal is not even going to do it.

252
00:15:43,889 --> 00:16:09,320
What?

253
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,740
What are you doing here?

254
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,879
Because you're doing it a lot.

255
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:13,460
Oh.

256
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,340
You are going to do it for a bit.

257
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,299
Oh.

258
00:16:16,299 --> 00:16:17,559
You're going to do it for nada?

259
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:18,860
Who is going to do it?

260
00:16:19,259 --> 00:16:19,799
Oh.

261
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:22,080
You don't know how to change your company anymore.

262
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:25,509
I'm a company you already know, and I'm very proud you.

263
00:16:25,509 --> 00:16:28,250
Oh, there's a new company here.

264
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:31,250
They are also a personal employer.

265
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,250
What really happened?

266
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:42,500
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.

267
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,759
I don't think it's the same.

268
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:50,759
But the other part of the story is that it's different.

269
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:53,759
I don't think it's even the same thing.

270
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,059
What?

271
00:16:57,059 --> 00:17:15,990
Where are you?

272
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:16,990
See?

273
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:20,339
Oh, you don't have to be an architect?

274
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:23,579
You'd be happy to do this, girl.

275
00:17:30,269 --> 00:17:32,950
Catherine Cough's it!

276
00:17:33,109 --> 00:17:35,710
I've never heard of it.

277
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:39,519
Who, you've never heard?

278
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,319
No, I'd never heard of it.

279
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,079
I'll tell you the truth.

280
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,960
What do you want, my friend?

281
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:48,920
I don't know.

282
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:53,039
I've always heard of love about how we'd become.

283
00:17:56,009 --> 00:17:57,289
What's next?

284
00:17:57,289 --> 00:18:03,210
I know that there are many ways to connect the world with the world.

285
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:04,769
I'm not sure.

286
00:18:04,769 --> 00:18:10,890
I'm not sure that there are many ways to connect the world.

287
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:12,049
I love you!

288
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:20,369
I love you and I love you.

289
00:18:20,369 --> 00:18:25,059
I want to help you with the music.

290
00:18:25,059 --> 00:18:26,859
I want to help you.

291
00:18:26,859 --> 00:18:31,130
But I want to help you with the music.

292
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:35,369
Why are you still here?

293
00:18:35,369 --> 00:18:38,029
I'm not going to do anything like this.

294
00:18:38,029 --> 00:18:41,230
But you don't want to be a good teacher.

295
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:44,829
I'm not going to do anything like this.

296
00:18:44,829 --> 00:19:03,200
You're a good teacher.

297
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,519
You're a good teacher.

298
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:05,880
I'm a good teacher.

299
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,799
I'm not going to do anything like this.
