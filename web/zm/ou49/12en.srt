1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,140
These are the rare characters that are leading their own character.

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:08,339
There are many characters that support the characters of a character.

3
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:10,099
Are you really good at this?

4
00:00:10,099 --> 00:00:14,970
If you want to actually get your own effects.

5
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:20,170
We'rema's first character who had a very rare character.

6
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:24,910
The truth is, there's no experience in the character of a character or something.

7
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:29,469
But yes, we will have a little patience.

8
00:00:29,469 --> 00:00:32,090
But it looks like we're not going to get there.

9
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:33,509
And there's no idea.

10
00:00:33,509 --> 00:00:35,329
But there is no idea for me.

11
00:00:35,329 --> 00:00:36,890
No.

12
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:38,530
I can't see everybody's experiences,

13
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:40,549
and it's a very attractive relationship

14
00:00:40,549 --> 00:00:42,170
when a facility is located.

15
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:44,250
It's a very attractive thing.

16
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,049
It's not like you're going to be able to look at.

17
00:00:45,049 --> 00:00:58,210
Yeah.

18
00:00:58,210 --> 00:00:59,729
Mr. Yaba, can I see the other thing?

19
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:00,929
Where is the street?

20
00:01:00,929 --> 00:01:01,869
It's different.

21
00:01:01,869 --> 00:01:04,609
I wasn't working here.

22
00:01:04,609 --> 00:01:07,750
Because you're not working here for me.

23
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,469
I can't look at this.

24
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:11,950
So, I always experience this, but it's just like it.
