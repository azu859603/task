1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.830
We can't stop in the past two months, but we are working with each other.

2
00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.419
Okay.

3
00:00:06.419 --> 00:00:10.240
So now we're going to spend a lot of time with the elections,

4
00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.199
and we'll have to make a lot of money.

5
00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:16.859
If we don't get the opportunity, we'll be able to make a couple of money.

6
00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.399
We will have a lot of money to do.

7
00:00:18.399 --> 00:00:20.339
Do you want to leave?

8
00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:21.460
I'm not willing.

9
00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.760
I'm not willing to leave you, but you can't leave me alone.

10
00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.539
I'm not going to respond.

11
00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:28.820
I want to talk about that.

12
00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.820
But it is very rare to be here in the area,

13
00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.659
with a room that you want to see.

14
00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:36.659
And a truly beautiful view of the city and the surrounding mountains.

15
00:00:36.659 --> 00:00:38.659
The colours are beautiful,

16
00:00:38.659 --> 00:00:43.140
and a familiar dark and cultural side of the Palace ofmarcope.

17
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.140
They are perfect for us to be prepared.

18
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.140
They've never been able to describe them,

19
00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.140
but it's a perfect process that is also built.

20
00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.140
In fact, they are the most beautiful stories,

21
00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.380
the La Nochela Manana-Soua-Lordi Mercado Serado

22
00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.380
who in those milmigones is the Dolores.

23
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.380
Enjoy the ride!
