1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.060
You don't want to please me?

2
00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:05.509
I'm not the one who is still the guy who lives.

3
00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:08.869
I think I'm not the guy who lives, I'm not the one who lives.

4
00:00:08.869 --> 00:00:10.070
I'm the one who lives.

5
00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:11.150
Do you?

6
00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.500
I'm not the one who lives.

7
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.619
I say I'm the one who lives.

8
00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:17.579
I'll be the only one who lives.

9
00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:18.829
You're too.

10
00:00:18.829 --> 00:00:22.510
Like, the only one who lives just doesn't have your life.

11
00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:24.949
I will be the one who lives just doesn't have your life.

12
00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:28.489
You want to find yourself out easily.

13
00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:32.359
You need more help.

14
00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:39.479
to be filled with eternal death.

15
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.880
What do you think it's about your credentials?

16
00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.840
I'm the only one, to my own everything.

17
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:56.060
It is possible to have the one that will be out of time,

18
00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.039
to make hope of the world.

19
00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.379
It is possible, and to the people from the community.

20
00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.219
Before the world passes,

21
00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:09.340
I have no consequences to be here.

22
00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.060
which is why we're not getting into this situation.

23
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.019
But we know that we're not only asking the citizens the truth,

24
00:01:16.019 --> 00:01:17.379
it's about the freedom of our lives,

25
00:01:17.379 --> 00:01:21.040
so this will be the most important part of the experiment.

26
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.439
We are still thinking about the tools that we find being done.

27
00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:35.120
But as we say, we are also thinking about the ability to build the world.

28
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.280
We know that we're not going to be able to build a planet.

29
00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.930
But we don't have any more opportunities to be able to build it.

30
00:01:44.489 --> 00:01:46.750
It's a difficult connection.

31
00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.379
How can women see this?

32
00:01:50.379 --> 00:01:55.879
I can't think of the two in my own life.

33
00:01:55.879 --> 00:02:12.610
And in this moment, it's perfect.

34
00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.610
It's beyond a fine thing.

35
00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.759
I'm very smart with my own love.

36
00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:22.759
I'm glad you're here.

37
00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:25.759
But don't you want to be so familiar?

38
00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:29.759
I'm not alone, but I'm not alone with everyone.

39
00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:32.620
Hahahahaha...

40
00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.620
is that I have a look who tells me that I've been to the hotel since he was born

41
00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:35.620
of the age of 167

42
00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:42.699
that, but if I go here to the city

43
00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:44.699
there are no people working and living.

44
00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:47.120
so I also have a lot of money to work on,

45
00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.120
I believe that I have a money to work with.

46
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.430
That's it!

47
00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:51.430
We have to pay for it!

48
00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:52.430
Do you want to come?

49
00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:53.430
Yeah, still.

50
00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.430
Do you want to come join us again and sit with us here?

51
00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:56.430
What would you say to me?

52
00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.430
We don't want to make good money.

53
00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.430
Do you want to come here and send a penny to the city?

54
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.430
No, there's no money to come here.

55
00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:02.430
That's it!

56
00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:03.430
It's not just my desire.

57
00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.479
It's just toates.

58
00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:07.479
The people that I have,

59
00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:08.479
yes, are just not very good!

60
00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:09.479
I'm not sure they're connected.

61
00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:45.460
No it is a combination of the two.

62
00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.770
I can't be with my singing.

63
00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:53.500
This is the Academy of the Academy.

64
00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:54.939
How do you know?

65
00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:03.189
You know how to speak this language.

66
00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:10.490
I'm doing this with my observatory,

67
00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.289
and you take it all from the competency of the online program.

68
00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:17.050
I've had well enough time and I always thought

69
00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:20.329
that I'd be there to say that I was here

70
00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:24.629
that's a song that you can't catch earlier.

71
00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:28.259
And that's the studio's essay.

72
00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:31.420
Whenever I'm a seemser, I'm a very good dancer.

73
00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:39.220
So you can't do this, I'm so happy.

74
00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:40.819
I'm not going to say anything.

75
00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:42.040
I'll be canceled.

76
00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.319
I've got to take the moment and I'll come back.

77
00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:48.040
Thank you very much.

78
00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.660
I'm the most proudest of you.

79
00:04:49.660 --> 00:05:00.110
I'll go and dance.

80
00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.040

116
00:07:22.649 --> 00:07:28.379
But until now, we have to see the future of the world.

117
00:07:28.379 --> 00:07:36.680
This is one of the most unexpected problems of the world.

118
00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:41.040
We have to look at the world's most important problems.

119
00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:45.279
We have to see the future of the world's world.

120
00:07:45.279 --> 00:07:46.839
But what did you do?

121
00:07:46.839 --> 00:07:50.410
We have to look at the world's most important problems.

122
00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:53.269
We have been here for a long time.

123
00:07:53.269 --> 00:07:59.339
I have a friend who's going to the world's world.

124
00:07:59.339 --> 00:08:04.819
When my parents are gone, I am going to die.

125
00:08:04.819 --> 00:08:09.850
I do not have any of the enemies in my life,

126
00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:11.850
but with the money.

127
00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:17.279
I'm going to die.

128
00:08:17.279 --> 00:08:19.279
I'm going to die,

129
00:08:19.279 --> 00:08:22.279
and I'm going to die.

130
00:08:22.279 --> 00:08:27.800
I'm going to die,

131
00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:30.800
and die,

132
00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:33.990
and I'm going to die.

133
00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:35.789
Yes, that's right.

134
00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:38.679
It's just funny.

135
00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:40.309
And I don't care.

136
00:08:41.809 --> 00:08:44.049
You know this country.

137
00:08:44.049 --> 00:08:44.710
No.

138
00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:53.649
Poor students, huh?

139
00:08:56.419 --> 00:08:57.700
I don't care.

140
00:08:58.139 --> 00:09:01.580
My parents have discussed this in many technicals

141
00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:27.100
You are not my best friend.

142
00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:28.940
I am not your son.

143
00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:31.139
I don't care.

144
00:09:37.659 --> 00:09:39.779
I'm my best friend.

145
00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:44.169
Not your best friend.

146
00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:48.929
I hope you enjoyed this video and I'll see you in the next video.
