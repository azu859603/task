00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:11.890
I want to make it even in different ways.

2
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.580
It's very easy to see it,

3
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.019
it's a tiny thing.

4
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.920
Ï‰

5
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.059
A long time ago, there was a day where I was very alone.

6
00:00:28.059 --> 00:00:32.210
But I had a great dream, I had a great dream.

7
00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.250
I didn't want to talk to you before.

8
00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.689
I had nothing to do with you.

9
00:00:39.689 --> 00:00:40.689
I was so lost.

10
00:00:40.689 --> 00:00:43.710
I was entirely lost, I would never forget,

11
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.310
because I

12
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:49.390
are interested to convince you,

13
00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.570
to be fulfilled by the cause of the sooner the day you were.

14
00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.869
I had to always learn that."

15
00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:57.590
The story is about the rest of the world.

16
00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.969
The place we meet is about living in.

17
00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.810
We will become a family for the future.

18
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.019
Say, don't tear your back.

19
00:01:08.459 --> 00:01:09.900
Don't tear my back down.

20
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:19.719
Make your first to eat.

21
00:01:21.269 --> 00:01:22.310
You won't hurt.

22
00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.269
You won't hurt.

23
00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.430
I'm surprised when you hurt.

24
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.010
You can't hurt your back.

25
00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.489
I have my back up.

26
00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.290
I will tell you.

27
00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:36.530
I have my back up now and tell you.

28
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.680
Don't tear your back.

29
00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.250
Thank you very much for watching, and I'll see you in the next video!
