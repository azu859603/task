1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:08,779
It's a girl and she is one, she belongs to our friends.

2
00:00:08,779 --> 00:00:11,099
We've been out there now.

3
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:12,900
The best part of this is about the place.

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,080
Why do you feel we can't have a friend with my friend?

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,500
I was a friend with my friend who was wearing my friend.

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,800
Do you think it's a great place to be in the city?

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,100
What's that like?

8
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,059
What about the place that we have been thinking?

9
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:28,780
I think it's a great place.

10
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:33,369
I'm both of you.

11
00:00:33,369 --> 00:00:38,759
In one place,

12
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:40,100
What is that?

13
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:43,000
What is it that is this?

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,539
What is it that are you?

15
00:00:47,539 --> 00:00:49,520
I mean, like a clown.

16
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,280
It's not that fast.

17
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,200
I don't know who you're going to go for.

18
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,840
And you're doing what you want.

19
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,810
Wait, you need to go for it.

20
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:00,909
Surely.

21
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:10,200
I know you're going to be a clown.

22
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,099
No.

23
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,680
I don't know why.

24
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,140
But the album is not that fast.

25
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:18,219
Many of you were playing as a clown.

26
00:01:18,219 --> 00:01:24,409
How can I run this song in the beginning of the video?

27
00:01:28,579 --> 00:01:33,319
Skarzeni, I'm feeling more awake than you in the end,

28
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:35,879
but we are not afraid.

29
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:38,719
I'm feeling more awake than you.

30
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:51,099
I'm feeling more awake than you in the beginning.

31
00:01:51,099 --> 00:01:56,280
I don't know, I'm feeling a bit more awake than you and it's the only one she has to make.

32
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:04,540
It's Barry

33
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,670
I'm not sure if I'm going to be here.

34
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:08,669
I'm not going to be here.

35
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:10,669
I'm not going to be here.

36
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:12,669
I'm not going to be here.
