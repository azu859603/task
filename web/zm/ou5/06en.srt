00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
But today, we still need to work out our family and we have to work out ourselves.

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:06,580
– Ah!

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:07,509
– What?

4
00:00:07,509 --> 00:00:08,509
– I'll do this!

5
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:09,990
– Why?

6
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:12,650
– Why?

7
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:17,160
– I'll do this.

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,000
I'll do this for you.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,839
I will do this to help you if you want to become a human.

10
00:00:20,839 --> 00:00:24,149
– I'll do this to you!

11
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:31,839
I'll do this for you.

12
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:35,420
– I'll do this to you!

13
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:36,420
– I'll do this to you!

14
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:37,859
I'll do this to you!

15
00:00:37,859 --> 00:00:38,979
I'll do this for you!

16
00:00:38,979 --> 00:00:44,689
I'll do this for you!

17
00:00:44,689 --> 00:01:12,180
As long as the ship is in touch, they can't wait to see what they have.

18
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,760
Here is the movie.

19
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:25,060
How many hours do you have?

20
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:31,939
I don't know how many days I've just filmed the movie.

21
00:01:31,939 --> 00:01:35,090
Yes, I will only stop on this film.

22
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:37,890
I will never start to see it, it's all just one day.

23
00:01:37,890 --> 00:02:13,150
Who knows, who has no idea where to go.

24
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:16,300
What do you have to say to them?

25
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:28,250
But what if they don't want to see it?

26
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,710
I don't know.

27
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,949
I have to say to them.

28
00:02:31,949 --> 00:02:33,110
Another one?

29
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,110
Baby, air catch.
