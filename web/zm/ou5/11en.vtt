00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:14.310

See?

31
00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:05.919
See this as the complete result,

32
00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:11.479
sharing it with the people who read and read and read.

33
00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:14.879
Now, I'll stop, I'm not really aware,

34
00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:24.280
I'm not always aware of the fact that I'm not aware of the fact that I'm not aware of the fact.

35
00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.180
But, I don't like it, I'm not aware of the fact that I'm not aware of the fact that I'm not

36
00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.139
you're coming back with more energy feedback for the Japanese people.

37
00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:34.460
I'm not trying to let you go.

38
00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.860
You never feel like challenging as well as to what you're trying to do.

39
00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:46.590
I feel like you can do much better than you are.

40
00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.060
What even do you think?

41
00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.979
Do you feel like, you feel like you're going to have to feel like you are a little too

42
00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:57.020
full of things.

43
00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:29.660
only five days.

44
00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:30.660
With every single person,

45
00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.689
they are allascading to the beginning.

46
00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:34.689
But how about that?

47
00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:36.709
I don't know,

48
00:04:36.709 --> 00:04:37.709
but I am not sure

49
00:04:37.709 --> 00:04:39.709
if I'm not sure how much I have.

50
00:04:39.709 --> 00:04:40.709
I don't know,

51
00:04:40.709 --> 00:04:43.540
but that's why I'm not going to go back.

52
00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.540
What are you doing now?

53
00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.540
What are you doing?

54
00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.769
I'm going to go back to school and school.

55
00:04:49.769 --> 00:04:51.149
I'm not going to school.

56
00:04:51.149 --> 00:04:53.149
What are you doing now?

57
00:04:53.149 --> 00:04:55.149
I'm going to go back to school.

58
00:04:55.149 --> 00:04:57.149
I'm going to go back to school.

59
00:04:57.149 --> 00:04:58.149
I don't know.

60
00:04:58.149 --> 00:05:01.589
I'm going to go back to school.

61
00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:18.750
Me?

62
00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:21.589
Okay, ten minutes ago.

63
00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:23.629
Enter the enemy, and his team.

64
00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:26.310
He also took an interview after the championship team.

65
00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:32.879
He skipped his problems.

66
00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:34.600
I'm not going to tell you.

67
00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.819
I'm going to have...

68
00:06:36.819 --> 00:06:38.980
I'm too tired.

69
00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:40.500
Now.

70
00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.970
Ah okay.

71
00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:46.110
I'm shy.

72
00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:47.110
I'm tired.

73
00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:49.939
My family's gone.

74
00:06:49.939 --> 00:06:52.860
How do you get out of here?

75
00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:55.370
We're all tired, and wait for you.

76
00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:57.810
However, the former society is excited, is that they are the people who exist.

77
00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:01.350
and we will see which groups are the best I'm talking about.

78
00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:05.540
You should have heard the group tuning in.

79
00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:08.220
I'm glad you are so pleased.

80
00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:12.300
I am the only one with you and I will know.

81
00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:28.449
I'm not doing the group, right?

82
00:07:28.449 --> 00:07:30.529
I'm not the only one with you.

83
00:07:30.529 --> 00:07:34.250
We haven't been to the group before.

84
00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:37.180
You are not one of the best ones.

85
00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:39.459
Catch the group, I'll take.

86
00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:41.620
I will see you all, right?

87
00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:48.920
In Kosovo, for the people who are watching this video,

88
00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:52.279
I think that this game is all about this game,

89
00:07:52.279 --> 00:07:58.439
that I think this is a game that is a game that is very fair,

90
00:07:58.439 --> 00:08:03.939
that I think something is about the game that is which is so awesome.

91
00:08:03.939 --> 00:08:08.540
This game is designed to be designed for us.

92
00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:12.459
The world is why this game is designed for us.

93
00:08:12.459 --> 00:08:15.019
Now, let's talk about this game,

94
00:08:15.019 --> 00:08:16.639
Okay, so what are you doing here?

95
00:08:16.639 --> 00:08:19.279
I'm just going to start the last time.

96
00:08:19.279 --> 00:08:20.240
It's my turn.

97
00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:25.540
I'm a little bit confused because I'm tired of it.

98
00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:29.250
Well, I'm inside the street.

99
00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:30.240
You're tired of it?

100
00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:32.299
Yeah, I'm tired.

101
00:08:32.299 --> 00:08:34.210
I'm tired of it.

102
00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:35.509
I'm tired of it.

103
00:08:35.509 --> 00:08:36.470
And I'm tired of it.

104
00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:37.649
I'm tired of it.

105
00:08:37.649 --> 00:08:39.070
I'm tired of it.

106
00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:40.529
I'm tired of it.

107
00:08:40.529 --> 00:08:41.889
You're tired of it.

108
00:08:41.889 --> 00:08:43.690
There's no need.

109
00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:45.230
You're tired of it.

110
00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:47.509
I'm tired of it.

111
00:08:47.509 --> 00:08:50.309
Sybil will be out in his backyard.

112
00:08:50.309 --> 00:08:53.509
He is not only here, but also in the other country.

113
00:08:53.509 --> 00:08:56.049
He was in the same place as you could see.

114
00:08:56.049 --> 00:08:58.929
He's never seen anything like this.

115
00:08:58.929 --> 00:09:01.309
fend if you're in the same place.

116
00:09:01.309 --> 00:09:03.730
He's the only man in the same place.

117
00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:04.120
He says,

118
00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:05.240
if you're true,

119
00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:08.320
don't think the only man is completely wrong.

120
00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:09.700
But, I think,

121
00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:11.639
he is also the only man in the same place.

122
00:09:11.639 --> 00:09:13.240
You're not going to get it.

123
00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.100
You're not going to leave.

124
00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:18.080
You don't have to leave.

125
00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:25.830
Yes, that's right,AND we're gonna try to find it.

126
00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:29.429
Have a good day, be free, and I'll make sure to get

127
00:09:29.429 --> 00:09:33.669
that coz I'm here.

128
00:09:33.669 --> 00:09:36.490
Yes, thank you so much for the evening,

129
00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:37.909
and thank you for being here for the evening,

130
00:09:37.909 --> 00:09:41.309
for yourself and for the evening.

131
00:09:41.309 --> 00:09:42.309
You're welcome.

132
00:09:42.309 --> 00:09:42.769
I'll see you next week, and I'll see you next week.

133
00:09:42.769 --> 00:09:52.850
Thank you, and I'll see you next time so stay safe!

134
00:09:52.850 --> 00:10:05.509
Thanks so much for being here.

135
00:10:05.509 --> 00:10:10.940
Good night I'm going to see you in my last album today.

136
00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:11.779
See you again soon.

137
00:10:11.779 --> 00:10:13.580
Bye, bye, bye.

138
00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:17.740
You don't have money to make a heavy force.

139
00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:20.080
But I can't afford buy too much.

140
00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:27.870
If you're a professional, you can't have money.

141
00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:29.529
Then you can travel your ship.

142
00:10:29.529 --> 00:10:45.769
If you're a professional, you can travel your ship.

143
00:10:45.769 --> 00:10:53.389
If you bought a engine, you can't have it anymore.

144
00:10:53.389 --> 00:10:55.330
I'll have it on the ship.

145
00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:58.409
No one will worry about it.

146
00:10:58.409 --> 00:11:00.129
Thank you for your question.

147
00:11:00.129 --> 00:11:01.529
I have my courage to be welcomed.

148
00:11:01.529 --> 00:11:02.889
It's been a while,

149
00:11:02.889 --> 00:11:04.049
I met with my wife,

150
00:11:04.049 --> 00:11:05.169
a young girl,

151
00:11:05.169 --> 00:11:08.289
and I have been a meet-up with some people.

152
00:11:08.289 --> 00:11:11.450
I wanted to see that I will be together

153
00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:12.450
and to grow over the years.

154
00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:13.929
I am a leader of the West Coast,

155
00:11:13.929 --> 00:11:15.850
I'm a young girl.

156
00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:17.009
I am a young girl,

157
00:11:17.009 --> 00:11:20.409
and I have to be comfortable with my family.

158
00:11:20.409 --> 00:11:21.929
I am not a big fan of it,

159
00:11:21.929 --> 00:11:23.769
and also a family and a library of my children,

160
00:11:23.769 --> 00:11:24.809
and my daughter,

161
00:11:24.809 --> 00:11:26.370
and family of my children.

162
00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:27.769
I'm a large,

163
00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:37.100
The

164
00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:38.659
Really, it's different.

165
00:13:38.659 --> 00:13:46.179
I'm not sure if you're afraid of one of these.

166
00:13:46.179 --> 00:13:53.549
I'm a really good dog.

167
00:13:53.549 --> 00:13:59.019
I want to eat a little bit of food.

168
00:13:59.019 --> 00:14:08.120
I'm enjoying it for you.

169
00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:10.179
I want you to eat.

170
00:14:10.179 --> 00:14:11.779
You're gonna eat it.

171
00:14:11.779 --> 00:14:19.490
You'll eat.

172
00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:23.029
Oh, yeah, you'll eat it.

173
00:14:23.029 --> 00:14:24.330
I'm food.

174
00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:30.750
Do not eat.

175
00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:31.909
I'll eat it.

176
00:14:31.909 --> 00:14:33.649
I'll eat it.

177
00:14:33.649 --> 00:14:34.909
I want to eat it.

178
00:14:34.909 --> 00:14:42.549
Oh let's go!

179
00:14:42.549 --> 00:14:43.070
your

180
00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:55.870

00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:50.580
I

188
00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:56.059
I

189
00:15:56.059 --> 00:15:57.090
I

190
00:15:57.090 --> 00:15:58.090
I

191
00:15:58.090 --> 00:16:03.710
I

192
00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:04.710
I

193
00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:06.710
I

194
00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:09.279
I

195
00:16:09.279 --> 00:16:14.580
And the other thing is that I'm a friend of mine I'm a friend of mine of mine.

196
00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:17.100
I'm a friend of mine.

197
00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:18.000
What is this?

198
00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.700
It's amazing that you're about to have fun.

199
00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:20.700
It's so nice!

200
00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:22.200
It's so cool.

201
00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:24.200
You can't tell what you're doing.

202
00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:26.580
It's so cool to have fun.

203
00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:27.379
It's so cool.

204
00:16:27.379 --> 00:16:29.779
The idea is why I've been to this place.

205
00:16:29.779 --> 00:16:31.879
And I have been to this place.

206
00:16:31.879 --> 00:16:34.220
It's so beautiful.

207
00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:35.620
And I have been to this place.

208
00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:39.220
I have been to this place, the place where I'm from.

209
00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:41.539
I'm just trying to find out.

210
00:16:41.539 --> 00:16:55.019
Now I can't believe we can't give up this battle.

211
00:16:55.019 --> 00:16:57.899
Let me ask you if I can't make it, the same.

212
00:16:57.899 --> 00:17:03.879
A lot of people are not going to say anything.

213
00:17:03.879 --> 00:17:06.579
I'm okay.

214
00:17:06.579 --> 00:17:24.349
I'm okay.

215
00:17:24.349 --> 00:17:25.349
I'm okay.

216
00:17:25.349 --> 00:17:26.349
I'm okay.

217
00:17:26.349 --> 00:17:27.349
I'm fine.

218
00:17:27.349 --> 00:17:28.799
I'm fine.

219
00:17:28.799 --> 00:17:29.799
I'm fine.

220
00:17:29.799 --> 00:17:30.799
I'm fine.

221
00:17:30.799 --> 00:17:33.049
I'm fine.

222
00:17:33.049 --> 00:17:34.049
I'm fine.

223
00:17:34.049 --> 00:17:37.180
I mean, I'm not sure what that's going on.

224
00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:40.109
I do know that something but, it's the healthiest.

225
00:17:40.109 --> 00:17:43.789
But that's the only thing.

226
00:17:43.789 --> 00:17:46.569
I have so much time to do what it's going to happen to me.

227
00:17:46.569 --> 00:17:48.950
I'll tell you what it's going to happen.

228
00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:51.289
I'm not sure what it's going to happen.

229
00:17:51.289 --> 00:17:52.190
If this is the first time, please.

230
00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:53.470
I want to start heading to the screen.

231
00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:55.329
What I'm saying today, please, please.

232
00:17:55.329 --> 00:17:56.740
I'm so glad you're here.

233
00:17:56.740 --> 00:17:58.460
Well, I'm not sure what it is.

234
00:17:58.460 --> 00:17:59.440
It's not going to happen.

235
00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:02.880
I'm not sure what the weird, the weird, the weird thing.

236
00:21:58.799 --> 00:22:05.440
You can't do this anymore, but I'd still forget that you don't want me.

237
00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:06.839
I don't want you to know.

238
00:22:06.839 --> 00:22:09.539
I want a dirty smile.

239
00:22:09.539 --> 00:22:15.089
I want a light so that you don't want me to disappear.

240
00:22:15.089 --> 00:22:20.130
You just make a cocky face.

241
00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:22.299
What should I do?

242
00:22:22.299 --> 00:22:41.349
Do you want a little hole in my face?

243
00:22:41.349 --> 00:22:46.839
Go into the exploration world and we are in the forest.

244
00:22:47.019 --> 00:22:52.180
This is what I want to show you from the story because you are so lucky.

245
00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:53.460
This is what we are going to do.

246
00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:56.380
We have to hang a lot of others away.

247
00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:58.529
But it's not for us.

248
00:22:58.529 --> 00:23:00.089
Let's go in.

249
00:23:00.089 --> 00:23:01.529
There's our second story.

250
00:23:01.529 --> 00:23:06.269
It looks like we are about to go into the wild level.

251
00:23:06.269 --> 00:23:07.910
Where do we go?

252
00:23:08.089 --> 00:23:13.160
You do not have to go.

253
00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:48.400
There is a two-year-old from the

254
00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:51.779
This is the plain one I've lived in.

255
00:23:51.779 --> 00:23:53.259
I can't tell you what he is.

256
00:23:53.579 --> 00:23:56.940
What's the difference between you and me?

257
00:24:03.079 --> 00:24:10.019
And you all have to know what you are doing too?

258
00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:12.279
He's working with me.

259
00:24:12.279 --> 00:24:13.900
He's doing something good.

260
00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:15.539
I got a good painting.

261
00:24:15.539 --> 00:24:16.960
And that's why I got this right.

262
00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:18.859
My best friend is in the city.

263
00:24:19.019 --> 00:24:20.059
He told me to wear clothes.

264
00:24:20.059 --> 00:24:25.900
And I wanted to get a good photos.

265
00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:30.069
for your long time and your future to go.

266
00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:33.680
There are thousands of Americans in this country.

267
00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:42.019
But we don't give up any jobs until this happened.

268
00:24:44.079 --> 00:24:45.440
We don't know how to go.

269
00:24:47.819 --> 00:24:49.180
We don't know how to go.

270
00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:50.619
We don't know how to go.

271
00:24:50.619 --> 00:24:52.059
We don't know how to go.

272
00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:53.900
No One would tell us that we have to be married.

273
00:24:54.059 --> 00:24:56.460
You want to go over to where?

274
00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:57.900
And where?

275
00:24:58.380 --> 00:24:59.700
If you want to go in?

276
00:25:01.849 --> 00:25:03.170
I'll find a new place.

277
00:25:03.730 --> 00:25:05.089
I'll find animals!

278
00:25:05.089 --> 00:25:09.710
the more pussy people

279
00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:12.670
I'm not afraid to make any way easy, I'm scared

280
00:25:12.670 --> 00:25:15.009
ok I'm scared, I'm afraid

281
00:25:15.009 --> 00:25:17.720
so you don't have money yet

282
00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:19.720
you need to be scared

283
00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:20.220
yes!

284
00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:21.220
Adores me!

285
00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:23.220
You need to go over your stuff

286
00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:27.779
What's wrong?

287
00:25:27.779 --> 00:25:29.779
I can't get a disappear

288
00:25:29.779 --> 00:25:33.059
such that I have no money

289
00:25:33.059 --> 00:25:35.059
but I don't have money

290
00:25:35.059 --> 00:25:37.059
I don't want to die

291
00:25:37.059 --> 00:25:39.059
I... I want to go over

292
00:25:39.059 --> 00:25:40.279
Go, wait.

293
00:25:47.079 --> 00:25:51.470
Go, wait, wait.

Get there.

298
00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:07.390
Go, wait that way.

299
00:26:07.390 --> 00:26:09.150
Get there.

300
00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:11.329

Oh, now I'll enter my critical.

305
00:26:17.769 --> 00:26:20.960
I want to see you.

I will also do a special interview,

307
00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:29.819

308
00:26:29.819 --> 00:26:38.279
and if you want to see a comedian,

309
00:26:38.279 --> 00:26:40.410
you will be a comedian.

310
00:26:40.410 --> 00:26:42.410
Just like you did.

311
00:26:42.410 --> 00:26:47.660
You have a dream that I am a man who has seen many of us.

312
00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:49.660
I am not a boy.

313
00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:54.829
I am a boy!

314
00:26:54.829 --> 00:26:57.529
I am a boy!

315
00:26:57.529 --> 00:27:00.329
You are a man.

Thanks.

318
00:27:05.119 --> 00:27:08.509
Hi, everyone.

319
00:27:08.509 --> 00:27:10.109
I'm S massive,

320
00:27:10.109 --> 00:27:13.470
and I'm going to come to explore the world with a little of Boulis.

321
00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:17.210
It's really huge

322
00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:19.309
and fantastic.

323
00:27:19.309 --> 00:27:23.019
It's too far.

324
00:27:23.019 --> 00:27:25.579
We've just seen this artepiece,

325
00:27:25.579 --> 00:27:41.440
with the most beautiful

326
00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:43.440
What do you think?

327
00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:45.630
I don't know.

328
00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:47.630
I just can't tell you who to do this.

329
00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:49.630
I don't know if you're a big fan of this.

330
00:27:49.630 --> 00:27:52.630
I'm not really sure who to do this.

331
00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:55.630
I think I will be able to learn.

332
00:27:55.630 --> 00:27:57.109
What?

333
00:27:57.109 --> 00:27:59.109
I'm a little bit crazy.

334
00:27:59.109 --> 00:28:00.109
I'm not a little bit funny.

335
00:28:00.109 --> 00:28:02.109
I'm a little bit crazy.

336
00:28:02.109 --> 00:28:19.170
I'm not.

337
00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:21.170
I'm a little bit scared.

338
00:28:21.170 --> 00:28:23.170
I'm a little bit nervous.

339
00:28:23.170 --> 00:28:25.170
I'm a little bit nervous.

340
00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:27.170
I'm a little too scared.

341
00:28:30.809 --> 00:28:33.049
Eh, I have to do it.

342
00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:35.029
But how do you find it?

343
00:28:35.029 --> 00:28:37.529
Is this the only place for us to fight?

344
00:28:38.359 --> 00:28:41.680
Put me in the night to make it go on and eat,

345
00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:45.160
and it's the only place for the rest.

346
00:28:45.559 --> 00:28:46.640
Goodbye!

347
00:28:49.279 --> 00:28:50.759
Bye!

348
00:28:50.759 --> 00:28:52.279
I'm happy to see you here.

349
00:28:52.279 --> 00:28:54.680
I have to find you here.

350
00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:56.720
Thank you.

351
00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:59.400
I need to give you some advice to my friends.

352
00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:00.640
And I'm very happy to see you here.

353
00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:04.680
And a man himself has touched his neck, with his breath and his fear.

354
00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:13.859
He'll be able to escape everything, but he'll have to battles over the future.

355
00:29:13.859 --> 00:29:16.779
And in our way he'll be able to survive.

356
00:29:16.779 --> 00:29:18.940
And he's a thin man himself.

357
00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:20.440
And he'll take care of himself.

358
00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:22.500
And he'll be able to reach his face.

359
00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:24.279
But he can't go to the VA.

360
00:29:24.279 --> 00:29:27.410
So..

361
00:29:27.410 --> 00:29:36.210
If you want to go to the VA, I can go to the VA.

362
00:29:36.210 --> 00:29:37.769
We don't have to go to the VA now.

363
00:29:37.769 --> 00:29:40.869
But we have to go to the VA, where can we go?

364
00:29:40.869 --> 00:30:11.430
Thank you.

365
00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:16.720
It's the reason why I've seen you.

366
00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:20.380
I think I have to have a wide hand.

367
00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:22.559
I'm not going to let you just compete.

368
00:30:22.559 --> 00:30:25.299
I think you should have played very good.

369
00:30:25.299 --> 00:30:29.250
I'm not going to be in the middle of the Middle East,

370
00:30:29.250 --> 00:30:31.690
because I'm the only one that I can do.

371
00:30:31.690 --> 00:30:34.049
I love you so much.

372
00:30:34.049 --> 00:30:35.990
I'm not going to die.

373
00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:40.900
I fell down the street.

374
00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:43.380
First, you have to go inside and release this.

375
00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:50.160
I want you to go inside and release this for a minute.

376
00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:52.220
Let's see...

377
00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:56.940
...a new order for you to travel a lot later.

378
00:30:56.940 --> 00:30:58.500
I will take this route,

379
00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:00.059
and we'll go to active room,

380
00:31:00.059 --> 00:31:01.519
and we'll be out of the house,

381
00:31:01.519 --> 00:31:03.250
because maybe we'll start at second.

382
00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:06.450
So, this is a certain situation we can do.

383
00:31:06.450 --> 00:31:09.130
Okay?

384
00:31:09.130 --> 00:31:12.210
I'll do this next time.

385
00:31:12.210 --> 00:31:14.750
You have a dream?

386
00:31:15.089 --> 00:31:17.269
You have a dream, honey.

387
00:31:18.319 --> 00:31:20.119
I have a dream.

388
00:31:21.059 --> 00:31:22.279
You have a dream.

389
00:31:22.279 --> 00:31:23.579
You have a dream, honey.

390
00:31:23.579 --> 00:31:24.079
I have a dream.

391
00:31:24.079 --> 00:31:25.500
I'myla Sustain.

392
00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:27.259
I'm a dream, lonesome.

393
00:31:27.259 --> 00:31:29.869
I'm a dream, but I have a dream.

394
00:31:29.869 --> 00:31:30.750
Yes.

395
00:31:30.750 --> 00:31:31.710
Yes.

396
00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:35.029
I love you and I have a dream, 7,000.

397
00:31:35.029 --> 00:31:37.299
You know, I was born.

398
00:31:37.299 --> 00:31:38.700
You have to have me.

399
00:31:39.099 --> 00:31:47.910
You're a dream, bro.

400
00:31:47.910 --> 00:31:50.809
My son just said I'm going to make youbin humility.

401
00:31:50.809 --> 00:31:54.460
But it's not gonna be a gift,

402
00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:55.519
I want it to be a gift.

403
00:31:55.519 --> 00:31:57.059
And it's a gift to all of us.

404
00:31:57.059 --> 00:32:14.460
I want it to be a gift.

405
00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:15.859
Never mind it.

406
00:32:15.859 --> 00:32:17.119
We can't bring up the money.

407
00:32:17.119 --> 00:32:19.480
We can't put up money at all.

408
00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:21.160
We want it to be a gift.

409
00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:23.000
Wow, I'm not going to buy you.

410
00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.339
Come on, everyone.

411
00:32:24.339 --> 00:32:25.519
We'll have a gift.
