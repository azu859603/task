00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.330
Okay, I also have to go to the center on the back, the garden is the bridge.

2
00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:07.410
I would never want to eat it at all, I guess.

3
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:08.470
Hope I have to guess.

4
00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:12.070
I don't need to go to the center because I'm so Children with Mehrla.

5
00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:13.589
I need to go to the center.

6
00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:16.769
I need to do this for a long time to go back, but I don't even know if someone needs to

7
00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:17.769
go back?

8
00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:18.769
Don't stumble.

9
00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:22.010
People don't want to get me back.

10
00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.789
They're not going to stop.

11
00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:26.870
I'm not going to go to the center, it's the one that.

12
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.600
And what did you do?

13
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.840
And I made this video about the root of my life!

14
00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.840
So why did you tell me that everything I did in the past was so small!

15
00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.939
So why did you eat it all?

16
00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.939
And why did you eat it all?

17
00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
Because it's a whole whole life!

18
00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:23.510
I saw it in the car!

19
00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:29.640
The way I'm going to serve is life!

20
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:37.840
What are you doing with your message?

21
00:01:38.879 --> 00:01:40.810
What are you doing with your message?

22
00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:49.659
I don't know what you're doing with your message, but I'm not letting you guys know they are on someplace or any other side.

23
00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:50.920
I love that you're on my side.

24
00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:51.920
Yeah.

25
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.980
I'll be here when it's in here and when you're able to get off the stairs.

26
00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.140
Ok, I'll be here.
