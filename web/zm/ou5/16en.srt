1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,100
bidding won'

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,019
of no boys

3
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:07,339
if I still don't think I could feel my type of skin

4
00:00:07,339 --> 00:00:07,799
but if Iman

5
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:10,140
if I want to stay safely

6
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,679
prominent in some ways

7
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,080
I will continue to lower it

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,800
even to keep my stomach

9
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,120
I hang this corner

10
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,980
and navigate every other desert

11
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,359
that you cannot leave

12
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,519
How do I do with my fingers?

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,600
Why does that peculiar lie

14
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,899
that you don't realize I'm insecure

15
00:00:28,899 --> 00:00:34,000
And I was very shy in the background.

16
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,020
I was so tired, but with today's video..

17
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:39,299
I was so tired and I couldn't explain it.

18
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:41,909
I was so tired too.

19
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:43,229
I was so tired.

20
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,250
But I was so tired.

21
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:49,840
I was so tired.

22
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:52,039
I was so tired.

23
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:55,920
I wanted to go back to my house.

24
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,700
I was so proud and I was so tired.

25
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:01,859
How deep was the room?

26
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:05,430
I'm very tired.

27
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:08,430
I'm not a fool, I'm a fool.

28
00:01:11,069 --> 00:01:12,069
What are you doing?

29
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,540
I'm not a fool.

30
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,040
I'm a fool.

31
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:18,900
What are you doing?

32
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,400
I'm not a fool.
