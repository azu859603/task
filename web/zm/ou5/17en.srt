1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,139
How do you find out about the storage time and design landscape?

2
00:00:05,139 --> 00:00:13,599
I think we're going to use the Desmosculios application.

3
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,519
Do you think about the storage content of the kitchen?

4
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:22,519
Do you think about the storage content of the storage?

5
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:27,829
Do you think it's storage space?

6
00:00:27,829 --> 00:00:30,410
Do you think we're going out?

7
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:36,520
OK.

8
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,380
We are not interested in those quarrels.

9
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:46,640
We are also interested in their own

10
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,240
but we are all interested in them.

11
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,479
We are impressed.

12
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:53,060
It's not a question.

13
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:54,899
Which one?

14
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:56,840
I don't think we can tell.

15
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,100
It's why we are interested.

16
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,280
We don't know.

17
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:05,010
I am not interested in those Silicon Valley.

18
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:09,129
Now I am not interested in those unp European countries.

19
00:01:09,129 --> 00:01:12,569
Sandra, it's better!

20
00:01:13,569 --> 00:01:15,469
Hi!

21
00:01:15,469 --> 00:01:17,469
What are you looking for?

22
00:01:17,469 --> 00:01:19,469
There are so many of you!

23
00:01:23,969 --> 00:01:26,969
To do this, I'm going to show you how to do this.

24
00:01:26,969 --> 00:01:29,969
I'm going to tell you how to do this.
