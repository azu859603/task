1
00:00:05,059 --> 00:00:08,500
The house will be fixed, and they will take us to the future.

2
00:00:09,699 --> 00:00:12,500
Also, there will be a new design on the configurations.

3
00:00:13,669 --> 00:00:18,670
We will take all the parts from the top and the bottom of the floor.

4
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:19,910
We will get the plane to the back.

5
00:00:22,089 --> 00:00:23,929
Let's go inside.

6
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:26,949
All right, this is going to be the end.

7
00:00:27,289 --> 00:00:31,730
And you will go inside.

8
00:00:31,969 --> 00:00:34,090
All right, you have to go inside.

9
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:36,090
There we have to go inside.

10
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,549
Yes, I'll give this to you today.

11
00:00:39,549 --> 00:00:42,030
I'm going to tell you anything about this.

12
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:45,390
What is happening, where is the opposite side,

13
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:46,630
and here is the whole thing?

14
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:48,049
Here we are.

15
00:00:48,049 --> 00:00:50,200
How long is this all over here?

16
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,450
Oh, that's a wild one.

17
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:53,909
It's the first one.

18
00:00:53,909 --> 00:00:55,229
We're not supposed to be able to live.

19
00:00:55,229 --> 00:00:57,490
Let's go.

20
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:59,250
I'm not going to live.

21
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,149
I can do so much.

22
00:01:02,149 --> 00:01:22,700
I'll find a way to go.

23
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:23,700
Hello?

24
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:24,700
Congolores?

25
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,019
We can't have a great design sheet for this design.

26
00:01:27,019 --> 00:01:28,739
It can be a simple design sheet.

27
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:30,780
I'm getting scared of the rest of the design sheet.

28
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,900
But I can see it's a good design for the original design.

29
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,739
I'll make sure that this work is secure.

30
00:01:36,739 --> 00:01:38,420
Let's show you the design sheet.

31
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,060
I can see the inside of this design,

32
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:47,099
and I'll tell you that it's from that to that,

33
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:52,959
and I'll show you how to make this.

34
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:54,799
It also has the same skin,
