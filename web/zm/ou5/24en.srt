1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:10,160
What did you do?

2
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,560
I've been saying that this is the second life of the world over the centuries, in which

3
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,420
it is not just a society...

4
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:22,140
but it is important that there are many, the things that are in the world, that exist and

5
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,059
do we know?

6
00:00:24,059 --> 00:00:30,480
I don't know if we know where the world is, but I won't let people know what to do.

7
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,229
This is something we are seeing a lot of days, but in some ways it is worth watching it.

8
00:00:36,229 --> 00:00:45,840
We are from the city, now it's a lot better to watch, but we don't have one at all!

9
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,179
Doot hole!

10
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:49,179
Good day!

11
00:00:49,179 --> 00:00:50,179
Happy new year!

12
00:00:50,179 --> 00:00:51,179
Good night, guys!

13
00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:52,179
Thank you for watching!

14
00:00:52,179 --> 00:00:53,179
We are here today!

15
00:00:53,179 --> 00:00:54,179
Thanks for watching!

16
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:55,179
See you!

17
00:00:55,179 --> 00:00:56,179
Bye!
