00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,000
They are just like men in the United States.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,419
Okay, but if you think of it, you will be able to change the world.

3
00:00:13,419 --> 00:00:17,179
Yes, I mean, I'm not going to be able to change the world.

4
00:00:17,179 --> 00:00:20,620
I'm not going to be able to change the world.

5
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:24,519
Because this is a good thing to lose in life.

6
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:28,699
It's very easy to believe that I have to be able to change the world.

7
00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:33,399
I am not going to be able to change the world.

8
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:36,740
But I'm not gonna do anything, I'm not going to be able to do anything.

9
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:44,829
If you don't want to go to your celebrity casualism you can ask.

10
00:00:44,829 --> 00:00:46,740
4, 4, 5...

11
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:50,759
4, 4, 5, 5...

12
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:52,520
7, 4, 5...

13
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,460
7, 4, 5...

14
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:58,240
7, 4, 5, 5, 7...

15
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,140
7, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5...

16
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,489
7, 6, 5, 5...

17
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:10,909
I'm scared.

18
00:01:10,909 --> 00:01:12,430
I have to be scared.

19
00:01:13,489 --> 00:01:17,280
They're just a little bit nervous.

20
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:20,250
Who are you doing?

21
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:23,829
I don't think a lot of people going to 13-year school.

22
00:01:24,349 --> 00:01:28,280
So, I'm scared of you.

23
00:01:32,129 --> 00:01:34,719
I'm so scared.

24
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:37,439
I'm dying.
