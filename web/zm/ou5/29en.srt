1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:09,509
He's so close to me.

2
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:12,750
That's what I'm talking about.

3
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,130
My brother told me to talk to you.

4
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:22,780
He is a soul, perfect boy.

5
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:24,339
See you all, baby.

6
00:00:24,339 --> 00:00:26,699
You can always love nothing.

7
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:28,059
Where are you?

8
00:00:28,059 --> 00:00:32,750
What do you say?

9
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:36,979
Ah, yeah?

10
00:00:36,979 --> 00:00:38,979
Hey, I'm Vincent Dora, eh?

11
00:00:38,979 --> 00:00:43,310
Hey, Lisa!

12
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:53,820
Are you an open miracle?

13
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,820
Oh, we fell like a master of design in my text by Star-Q.

14
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:00,820
I'll leave the concept as I stand under my text.

15
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:03,820
I'm not going to do that, I'm not going to do that.

16
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:09,079
I'm not going to do that, I'm not going to do that, I'm not going to do that, I'm not going to do that.
