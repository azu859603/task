00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,580
Postcards are also hard to say.

2
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:09,619
Ugh, I'm so afraid.

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,220
You are feeling crazy. You are very tired.

4
00:00:14,939 --> 00:00:18,719
Do you want to say something?

5
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:20,800
Do you know this?

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,460
I have to say that people can't send me a message.

7
00:00:25,149 --> 00:00:26,089
You have to ask me questions.

8
00:00:26,269 --> 00:00:28,089
You have to ask questions.

9
00:00:28,129 --> 00:00:29,550
I'm wondering what you're doing in that way.

10
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:31,750
They are stupid, I guess.

11
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:33,250
What do you think?

12
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,250
The next time I'm in the car,

13
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,049
I'm going to go to the car and find out what's going on.

14
00:00:38,049 --> 00:00:41,420
I'm not going to go to the car.

15
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:43,420
Also, I'm in the car.

16
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:46,420
I'm going to go to the car and find out what's going on.
