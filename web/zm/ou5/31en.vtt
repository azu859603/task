00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.020
This is my son, who is the one who's a father.

2
00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:05.019
I know he's a father, but he's a father.

3
00:00:05.019 --> 00:00:07.019
I'm an ex-semitmenter.

4
00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:08.019
I'm not a father.

5
00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:10.019
I'm a father.

6
00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.019
If I was a father, I would be a father.

7
00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:14.109
My son is a father.

8
00:00:14.109 --> 00:00:16.109
I'm a father.

9
00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.460
This is my son.

10
00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.460
The mother is a father.

11
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.460
I'm a mother.

12
00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.460
My son is a father.

13
00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.460
And he is a mother.

14
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.260
I'm not sure if we can do any other things.

15
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.619
I'll try to find your own way.

16
00:00:34.509 --> 00:00:37.130
I can't do anything.

17
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.549
The reason why I didn't have any problem is that I have no problem.

18
00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.310
I've already asked the question.

19
00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:44.049
I'm not sure if I'm not going to.

20
00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:46.350
I'm not sure if I'm going to do it.

21
00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.869
I'm not sure if I'm going to do anything.

22
00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:51.149
Also, I'm a teacher.

23
00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:54.350
I'm a teacher. I'm a teacher and a teacher.

24
00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:56.509
I'm a teacher.

25
00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:04.069
2 days ago, the bad guys didn't know that I was dating a bit later.

26
00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:07.469
I don't know where I was, but I decided to get that he's also dating a little bit.

27
00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:10.310
Just to get that he got a good kid.

28
00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.030
You said so much.

29
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.230
Guys, I was a type of brother.

30
00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:16.620
What kind of a security can I have?

31
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.780
I'm a little bitch, but I have to say anything to you.

32
00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:28.760
I'm a text, that's the pretty one.

33
00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:29.959
SM attacks.

34
00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:30.840
I'm a text.

35
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.840
I'm a text, and I see how this is designed.

36
00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.430
I learned it from her.

37
00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.310
I grains but I didn't even know how to handle it.

38
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.689
I didn't want to have wings before.

39
00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:45.950
I don't want to know.

40
00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.329
...and so I respect my health.

41
00:01:48.629 --> 00:01:51.670
But what I didn't think of was that,

42
00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.390
that this is the idea.

43
00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:55.609
I found my way,

44
00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:56.310
so I said,

45
00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.430
that's not the idea.

46
00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.010
I couldn't wait out to see this.

47
00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:05.689
I'm not going to have to take on anything like that right now.

48
00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:12.759
I don't like being more famous than my ex CIS kids, especially my ex.

49
00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:14.759
I don't like buying tickets.

50
00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:16.680
Very cute.

51
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.400
I don't like eating.

52
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.879
I want to make a dream.

53
00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:23.639
I'm not mean to be in a car.

54
00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:25.520
What's going on here?

55
00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.560
My ex is a good boss.

56
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.919
I'm a good boss.

57
00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:30.800
I'm not a good boss.

58
00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:31.770
I don't like it.

59
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.289
I don't like you too.

60
00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:34.930
I prefer you to go home.

61
00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.819

62
00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:39.310

You see, you'll do me a mi!

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:42.949
Pass back to the modern deli!

65
00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:43.830
You will see it!

66
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:44.930
Oh....

67
00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.430
Yes you will, for ever.

68
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.849
You can also do a little bit of doing that.

69
00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:54.750
Oh, you'll see old me a mi comfido basuamined.

70
00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:55.669

71

You'll do me a mi tiabiena surprise.

74
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.289
You'll get to know that!

75
00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:08.969
I will never give rodeo the car from my friend,

76
00:03:09.169 --> 00:03:10.530
But I don't say...

77
00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.490
I'm here to meet someone here,

78
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.750
I can't give you the car,

79
00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:17.110
It's not a match.

80
00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:20.430
I'm really scared that I want you to have the job.

81
00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.229
I also want you to share your friend,

82
00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.469
I'm really afraid of the strange things,

83
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.870
I can't do this until the first day I'm here.

84
00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:29.900
I want you to know…

85
00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:32.060
I'm here for you to say,

86
00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.979
I want you to meet one of my friends.

87
00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:12.259
During this journey I was Poooponic to make sure that it was a fair amount of time

88
00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:16.259
I was very happy, and I was very happy

89
00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:23.639
I was really happy and happy that I did something to remind my friends right now

90
00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:31.519
I was there and loved because I'm so happy

91
00:04:31.519 --> 00:04:40.600
How did I get an impression of the Poooponic being so happy?

92
00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:46.139
So, so I will take a moment to make sure that I'm happy

93
00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:58.370
it's a good thing to do with the

94
00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:59.389
okay

95
00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:02.100
spare

96
00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:19.579
it's a good thing to do with the

97
00:05:19.579 --> 00:05:20.980
The police we see on the phone.

98
00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:23.480
We don't have any help.

99
00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.759
Bye!

100
00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:28.959
Sandra, what's going on right now?

101
00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.040
Hey, Chef,

102
00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.199
we'll make sure we take a bottle of water,

103
00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:40.480
and be safe.

104
00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:45.569
I'll phone you!

105
00:05:48.819 --> 00:05:50.720
What?! What are you doing?!

106
00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:53.970
No, no!

107
00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.370
It's not our fault!

108
00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:58.509
What do you want to know?

109
00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:01.970
The police are not going to go and leave,

110
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:05.050
but the police are not going to do anymore.

111
00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:07.250
I'm not going to go.

112
00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:08.509
It's better.

113
00:06:08.509 --> 00:06:09.269
No, no!

114
00:06:09.269 --> 00:06:10.389
You're not going to go anywhere!

115
00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:11.790
Why are you not going to go?

116
00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:13.370
I don't want to go!

117
00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:20.069
I'm not going to go.

118
00:06:20.769 --> 00:06:21.750
I don't want to go.

119
00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:24.350
I just want to go to the police.

120
00:06:25.709 --> 00:06:27.470
I want to go to the police,

121
00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:29.990
and it's not too bad.

122
00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.439
I'm not going to go.

123
00:06:33.439 --> 00:06:41.910
The question is, how do you feel about this?

124
00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:43.410
Well, that's the answer.

125
00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:45.449
How do you feel about this?

126
00:06:45.449 --> 00:06:47.579
I don't know.

127
00:06:47.579 --> 00:06:49.579
I can't believe it.

128
00:06:49.579 --> 00:06:52.860
I've been to the United States.

129
00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:56.860
But I really feel like it's about my family.

130
00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:01.589
What's the difference between you and your family?

131
00:07:01.589 --> 00:07:06.129
I'm not a human, I'm not a human.

132
00:07:06.129 --> 00:07:08.129
I feel like it's about my family.

133
00:07:08.129 --> 00:07:09.699
I'm a human.

134
00:07:09.699 --> 00:07:10.699
I'm not a human.

135
00:07:10.699 --> 00:07:19.319
I feel like it's about me.

136
00:07:19.319 --> 00:07:22.790
You should be able to give me a chance,

137
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:25.100
too.

138
00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:27.379
I thought you were going to do this.

139
00:07:27.379 --> 00:07:30.259
I'm going to be out next to you.

140
00:07:30.259 --> 00:07:34.860
I'm going to start your video.

141
00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:39.220
I'm going to be able to give you a chance.

142
00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:51.110
I like the picture with a beautiful hair.

143
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:53.050
I'm going to be able to see.

144
00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:55.399
I'll be in this photo and see how it looks.

145
00:07:55.399 --> 00:07:59.740
You should be able to see how it looks.

146
00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:08.810
I'm going to be able to see how it looks.

147
00:08:52.759 --> 00:08:56.049
What I stuttering daycare was so bad...

148
00:08:56.049 --> 00:09:02.000
I used to tell myself that I would barely even look in my head...

149
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.080
But I didn't know that I was in theoos.

150
00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:09.559
I'm really not thinking that I'mdsing a bad guy.

151
00:09:09.559 --> 00:09:12.639
I would not like something, I'd think.

152
00:09:12.639 --> 00:09:15.419
I wanted to tell him how much I am.

153
00:09:15.419 --> 00:09:17.840
No, you'd like something, like a baby.

154
00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:19.639
I don't want nothing.

155
00:09:19.639 --> 00:09:22.679
I don't want nothing.

156
00:09:22.679 --> 00:09:25.779
I don't want to call you a doctor or anything.

157
00:09:25.779 --> 00:09:28.860
What's the next thing?

158
00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:30.340
What's the next thing?

159
00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:34.009
What's the next thing?

160
00:09:34.009 --> 00:09:37.110
The next thing is...

161
00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:40.879
What is the next thing?

162
00:09:40.879 --> 00:09:44.840
What's the next thing we should do?

163
00:09:44.840 --> 00:10:13.059
Anyway, let's move the music to the room.

164
00:10:13.059 --> 00:10:14.799
The next thing is...

165
00:10:14.799 --> 00:10:22.909
the next thing is...

166
00:10:22.909 --> 00:10:26.600
the space.

167
00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:30.879
One of the music that was inspired by the music.

168
00:10:30.879 --> 00:10:40.700
There are co-op and there are many of us who are out.

169
00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:42.399
I don't know why this is a surprise.

170
00:10:42.399 --> 00:10:43.700
Well, it's a surprise.

171
00:10:43.899 --> 00:10:45.700
I don't know why this is a surprise.

172
00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.700
The last time I saw the surprise, I saw the surprise.

173
00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:50.700
Then I saw the picture.

174
00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:52.100
Then I saw it.

175
00:10:52.759 --> 00:10:54.460
I saw the picture.

176
00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:55.580
And then I saw the picture.

177
00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:59.139
I saw the picture.

178
00:11:00.679 --> 00:11:01.980
You didn't see it.

179
00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:03.679
I saw the picture.

180
00:11:07.879 --> 00:11:15.759
So...

181
00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:17.649
I thought I could do it in my garden.

182
00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:18.850
And then I thought,

183
00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:23.250
It was a very beautiful garden.

184
00:11:24.039 --> 00:11:26.990
To loot some stupid building

185
00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:28.940
What does it mean?

186
00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:30.259
Paying it to theoph enforcement

187
00:11:30.259 --> 00:11:32.669
It's a good way

188
00:11:32.669 --> 00:11:50.379
instrumental

189
00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:05.799
This is the top of the Rhairs

190
00:12:05.799 --> 00:12:06.580
oftype

191
00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:09.259
a vision in time

192
00:12:09.259 --> 00:12:19.559
Thank you so much for watching this video and I'll see you in the next video!
