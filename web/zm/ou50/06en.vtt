00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:06.410
I made her killing in tips today.

2
00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:07.410
But keep this up.

3
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.410
I'll be a millionaire in no time.

4
00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:12.730
She's so obsessed with money.

5
00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:14.730
Is she another gold digger?

6
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.730
I can't go through another rough patch.

7
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.100
Listen, before we get married,

8
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.100
there's something I should confess.

9
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.230
Miss.

10
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.230
Estella.

11
00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.230
I'm Estella.

12
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.259
And how should I address you?

13
00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:34.259
You could just call me Ethan.

14
00:00:34.259 --> 00:00:36.259
You should know I've been married before.

15
00:00:36.259 --> 00:00:39.539
And I'm a security guard.

16
00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:40.829
Uh-huh.

17
00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.950
Yeah, I've had no real career advancement.

18
00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.560
At best, I can become head of security.

19
00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.560
People have said that I have no ambition.

20
00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.189
Are you sure you want to marry someone like that?

21
00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:59.189
Well, you have experience.

22
00:00:59.189 --> 00:01:03.060
And you know how to run a household.

23
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.890
You've been in a stable relationship.

24
00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:12.109
As for the career, I mean, at least you have a steady job.

25
00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:18.780
Honest men are really hard to come by nowadays.

26
00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.519
Marrying you feels right.

27
00:01:22.519 --> 00:01:24.189
So don't worry.

28
00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:29.349
We'll figure it out together and we can have a family and we'll be happy.

29
00:01:29.349 --> 00:01:33.599
Hey, what an amazing pair.

30
00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:34.599
Perfect much.

31
00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:43.500
He looks just like the jerk who ruined my life.

32
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.340
Wait.

33
00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.340
Were you at the Dion hotel three years ago?
