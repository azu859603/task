00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:03.459
What did you think that this pattern would look good on me?

2
00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:06.900
That's so thoughtful.

3
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.400
I'm just gonna go buy this.

4
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:27.230
I have something for you.

5
00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:28.739
You're me?

6
00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:32.179
Do you think this color would look good on grandma?

7
00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:39.259
It is this expensive?

8
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.200
We should have returned this. I can't accept it.

9
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.200
They had a promotion for the hundred customer.

10
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.039
I got 90% off. I mean, how lucky am I?

11
00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:51.020
Still, I don't want you spending our money so recklessly.

12
00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:53.579
Even with the discount, it's still $5,000.

13
00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.340
Just think about our daily expenses.

14
00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:02.479
Why are you smiling?

15
00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:04.480
Nothing. You're just cute as all.

16
00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.650
You think you are, bitch?

17
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.650
Getting me fired?
