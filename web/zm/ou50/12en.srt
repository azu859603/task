1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,900
Oh, uh, I, um, I want to bet with a friend.

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:07,900
You gambled our savings?

3
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:11,900
Are you kidding me? That's so risky! Why would you do that?

4
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,900
Don't worry, it was a one-time thing, okay?

5
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:22,519
Yesterday you were mad at me, and now you're doing this. I don't understand.

6
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:28,550
Me neither. Better yet. How about we just start over? Clean slate.

7
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:50,009
I don't think I heard you right.

8
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:52,009
Stella married who?

9
00:00:52,009 --> 00:00:54,200
That bitch married my Ethan.

10
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:58,770
Same old Stella, always taking everything from me.

11
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,770
This can't happen. You need to win Ethan back.

12
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,769
Our company's feature depends on the Smith Group's investment.

13
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:10,019
Am I supposed to do that, Dad? You already made me fake a pregnancy to force Ethan into a marriage with me?

14
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:15,019
And then embezzled money from his company to cover up our debts? He won't take me back.

15
00:01:15,019 --> 00:01:18,019
I'm tired of hearing excuses. Think of something.

16
00:01:18,019 --> 00:01:21,700
Or do you want to get out done by Stella again?

17
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:30,689
Speak of the devil. Look who's calling. Took him long enough.

18
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:33,810
Work your magic, baby.

19
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:36,480
Hey Ethan!
