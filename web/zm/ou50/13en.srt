00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:08,220
Ethan, baby, your call was a lovely surprise. I missed you too.

2
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,220
Only only once. If you heard Stella again, you'll not like what happens next.

3
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,220
What are you talking about?

4
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:19,219
I saw you at the bakery. The shop manager confessed everything to me. There's no point in line.

5
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:22,219
Ethan, why are you talking to me like this? I'm your wife.

6
00:00:22,219 --> 00:00:23,219
Ex-wife.

7
00:00:23,219 --> 00:00:31,219
Ethan, please. This is all just a big misunderstanding. I didn't mean any of it, and Stella and you aren't meant to be together.

8
00:00:31,219 --> 00:00:39,219
What about what we had? Do you remember that night three years ago at the Dean Hotel? Don't you love me?

9
00:00:39,219 --> 00:00:45,219
The night was a mistake. And let me remind you, I saw the option to press criminal charges against you and your father.

10
00:00:45,219 --> 00:00:54,219
No, please, don't do that. You and Stella aren't meant together. She's just a waitress. I'm so much more. We should have a life together.

11
00:00:54,219 --> 00:00:59,219
Shut it. Stella's everything that you're not. She's kind, she's pure.

12
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:02,219
So just stay away from us or all the dude with you personally.

13
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:10,359
Just you wait, Ethan. Nothing comes from a dirty whore like Stella.
