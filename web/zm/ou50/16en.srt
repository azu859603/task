1
00:00:01,419 --> 00:00:06,809
Actually, my father here is a modest company driver,

2
00:00:07,809 --> 00:00:10,250
and my mother here is a very humble cleaner.

3
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:12,970
The company offers long-term benefits, meal plans,

4
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:15,609
but they struggle like the rest of us.

5
00:00:15,609 --> 00:00:19,289
Oh, I see, so you all work together

6
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:21,129
for the Smith Company.

7
00:00:21,129 --> 00:00:23,780
Wow, such loyalty.

8
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:27,100
Yes, very loyal indeed.

9
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,379
What's going on here?

10
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:32,049
Just play along, I'll tell you later.

11
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:33,450
Come, dear.

12
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,350
Have a seat.

13
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:38,670
Elise, make yourself at home.

14
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:41,070
This isn't right.

15
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:42,710
Oh, nonsense.

16
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,909
Does the leather feel nice on your skin?

17
00:00:44,909 --> 00:00:46,189
I can make one phone call

18
00:00:46,189 --> 00:00:49,630
and have the company shoot you the exact same one overnight.

19
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:51,149
Thank you so much,

20
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:52,750
but this really must be violating

21
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,270
some sort of company policy.

22
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,350
So really, we should all get out of here

23
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:58,350
before someone discovers us.

24
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,549
Because then you need to get your parents out of here

25
00:01:01,549 --> 00:01:02,909
before they get fired.

26
00:01:02,909 --> 00:01:03,750
Okay, what about you?

27
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:04,829
We can't just lean you here.

28
00:01:04,829 --> 00:01:06,709
Why don't you come with us?

29
00:01:06,709 --> 00:01:10,549
No, I have to deliver this to the CEO, personally.

30
00:01:10,549 --> 00:01:12,450
Why don't we just see what's inside?

31
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:13,609
What are you doing?
