00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.500
Please don't look at them.

2
00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:03.500
Son?

3
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:04.589
What's this?

4
00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:05.589
I don't know.

5
00:00:05.589 --> 00:00:08.740
Stella, do you care to explain yourself?

6
00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:10.740
I swear you have to believe me.

7
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.740
Someone is trying to ruin my life.

8
00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:13.740
We believe you.

9
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:14.740
You don't have to cry.

10
00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.570
Believe her.

11
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.890
Don't be fooled by this slut's innocent act.

12
00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:22.890
What are you doing here?

13
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.890
Mom, Dad, you look so tan.

14
00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.170
How was vacation?

15
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.170
Let me catch you up on the drama.

16
00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.170
This is my disgraced step-sister.

17
00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.170
She's been lying to you.

18
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.170
She claims to own a bakery when, in reality,

19
00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.170
she's been selling her skin for quick cash.

20
00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.170
She's been doing it since college.

21
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.170
My dad even kicked her out of the house.

22
00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.170
I was never oppressed to do this.

23
00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.170
This morally bankrupt woman is unfit for you, your son, and...

24
00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.170
Hold that filthy tongue of yours.

25
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.170
She's not unfit.

26
00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:51.170
You are.
