00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,839
Mom, Dad, just look at these photos.

2
00:00:02,839 --> 00:00:09,250
Press my daughter-in-law.

3
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:10,750
My real daughter-in-law.

4
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:12,750
It's not calling us Mom and Dad.

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,750
You've been divorced for two years already.

6
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:17,750
No, Mom. Ethan and I have plans to get back together.

7
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,750
Everything's gonna go back to normal.

8
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,750
What delusional world are you living in?

9
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,750
No way in hell would he ever get back with you.

10
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:25,820
Ruby, you're out.

11
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:26,820
Stella, you're in.

12
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:32,859
You've been through so much already.

13
00:00:32,859 --> 00:00:33,859
There's no idea.

14
00:00:33,859 --> 00:00:35,859
I have a home now.

15
00:00:35,859 --> 00:00:36,859
It's with us.

16
00:00:36,859 --> 00:00:37,859
Oh, please.

17
00:00:37,859 --> 00:00:38,859
You make me want to gag.

18
00:00:38,859 --> 00:00:40,859
This reject isn't worth your time.

19
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:42,859
I told you Hurdie and Stella would have its consequences.

20
00:00:42,859 --> 00:00:44,859
I will see where it really hurts.

21
00:00:44,859 --> 00:00:46,859
Your alimony payments.

22
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:49,939
No, you can't do this to me.

23
00:00:49,939 --> 00:00:50,939
I'm your one and only wife.

24
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:53,939
Security, get this crazy woman out of the building.

25
00:00:53,939 --> 00:00:56,960
Stella, you parasite.

26
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,960
I'll shot at your world or die trying.
