00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.359
So you married Stella on a whim?

2
00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:23.289
I feel horrible for her.

3
00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:27.420
Lucy, her mother's so early and then being kicked out by her father.

4
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.420
She deserves better.

5
00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.120
Mm.

6
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.730
Mother's right.

7
00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.979
Stella's our daughter now.

8
00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:34.979
We'll treat her as such.

9
00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:36.109
Thank you.

10
00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:37.109
Can I ask?

11
00:00:37.109 --> 00:00:40.109
Why are you hiding our real identities from her?

12
00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:43.340
Well, initially I thought she was after my money.

13
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:44.340
Mm.

14
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.340
No, you both know my dating history.

15
00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.340
So I lied and said I was a security guard.

16
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.340
Obviously that turned out not to be true.

17
00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.840
And I've just been trying to find the right time to tell her the truth ever since.

18
00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.939
Look, the sooner the better.

19
00:00:59.939 --> 00:01:02.100
You can't let this one slip away.

20
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.290
She is a catch.

21
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.450
Cherish her.

22
00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.450
Tell her the truth.

23
00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:23.620
You're sleeping in separate rooms.

24
00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:29.340
We need to intervene.

25
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.340
John, I know who started those rooms about my wife.

26
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.340
I'll get her name cleared.

27
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:41.579
Just get it done.

28
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.000
Dad, what are you doing?

29
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
I found termites layering in the house and I tracked the nest to your room.

30
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000
I hate to break it to you, man.

31
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
You're not sleeping here tonight.

32
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Okay.

33
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.099
I'll sleep on the couch.

34
00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:03.260
Don't be a fool.

35
00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.260
Go sleep with your wife for crying out loud.
