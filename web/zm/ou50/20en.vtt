What time is it?

2
00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:22.859
Late. I've got nowhere to sleep. Can I sleep here with you?

3
00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:49.869
Ethan, about my past, it's something that I just can't let go.

4
00:00:49.869 --> 00:01:01.259
More like it won't leave me alone. I've tried really, really hard to ignore it,

5
00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:11.000
but seeing those pictures, they just, they brought back a lot of memories for me.

6
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.310
It wasn't your fault. Don't let that asshole live around for you in your mind.

7
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:24.510
He can't hurt you anymore. We're family. We're here for you.

8
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:33.879
Didn't mean to lie. Hey.

9
00:01:33.879 --> 00:01:58.579
There's something I need to tell you. I hope you think I am.

10
00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:04.540
Really?
