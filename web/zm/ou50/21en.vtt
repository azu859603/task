00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:23.899
Last time in Ethan, good things will come, I promise.

2
00:00:23.899 --> 00:00:28.300
According to our investigation, the incident occurred at the Dion Hotel.

3
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.699
Three years ago there was a party and your wife was there.

4
00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:36.270
At the Dion Hotel, I was there that night.

5
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.250
The hotel's security footage seems to have been tampered with, however we did see that

6
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:59.740
Ruby was also at the party with your wife, Ruby.

7
00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.119
Come in.

8
00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:03.500
Hey baby.

9
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.939
I knew you wouldn't forget about me.

10
00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:05.939
I'm not here to drink.

11
00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.019
I thought I made that perfectly clear on the phone.

12
00:01:08.019 --> 00:01:10.219
I want to know the truth about that night.

13
00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:11.219
Aw.

14
00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:12.219
Come on.

15
00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:13.780
We can drink and talk, right?

16
00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:14.780
You know how I get.

17
00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.120
I'll tell you everything you want to know.

18
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:25.430
Promise.

19
00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.709
This is my game, Stella, and all the pieces are falling into place.

20
00:01:29.709 --> 00:01:33.030
Like now, your husband shows up at my door on his own accord.
