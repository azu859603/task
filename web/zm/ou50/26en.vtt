00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:08.519
Hey Pearl, dinner's in five, get ready for a feast.

2
00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.029
Mmm.

3
00:00:10.029 --> 00:00:15.900
Are you sure this is expired?

4
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.899
It looks so fresh.

5
00:00:17.899 --> 00:00:18.899
Of course.

6
00:00:18.899 --> 00:00:20.899
A friend's store has a high standards for freshness.

7
00:00:20.899 --> 00:00:23.899
They couldn't sell them, so I bought them all.

8
00:00:23.899 --> 00:00:26.789
Mmm.

9
00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.929
Hey Sam, are you okay?

10
00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:34.090
Yeah, I'm okay.

11
00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:35.570
You're bleeding.

12
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.570
Uh, I think I might have owned and cooked the meat.

13
00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:46.590
You, let me take over.

14
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.219
And I'll show you how it's done.

15
00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:57.259
Well, we're alive.

16
00:00:57.259 --> 00:00:59.259
I can get used to this.

17
00:00:59.259 --> 00:01:00.780
Are you done?

18
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.450
Yeah.

19
00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:03.450
Salt?

20
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:11.609
Oh, I gotta say Pearl, you make coming home a great place to be.

21
00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:13.609
I feel the same way.
