00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
Sweetheart, why are you crying?

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.620
Do you not like our gifts?

3
00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.219
If there's something else that you want, we can get it for you.

4
00:00:07.219 --> 00:00:10.500
Even if it's the moon, I have Ethan fetched for you.

5
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:19.879
No, no, it's just that life's been really hard

6
00:00:19.879 --> 00:00:23.989
since I lost my mom.

7
00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:28.359
I guess death just kind of does that to you.

8
00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:33.679
But birthdays became really insignificant.

9
00:00:33.679 --> 00:00:36.689
I'll be here with you guys.

10
00:00:36.689 --> 00:00:40.479
I don't know, I guess it's kind of changing my mind.

11
00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:45.600
And I really miss this, having the family.

12
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.780
I'm just really happy.

13
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.009
Ethan, what did you get me?

14
00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:56.609
Holy crap, this is nice.

15
00:00:56.609 --> 00:01:10.049
Oh, my God, it's beautiful.

16
00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.370
Just like you are.

17
00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:23.930
Happy birthday to you.

18
00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.769
Old bastards.

19
00:01:25.769 --> 00:01:27.650
They never wished me a happy birthday.

20
00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.450
Where are my flowers?

21
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:30.530
Look at all their smiles.

22
00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:31.689
Makes me sick.

23
00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:41.790
I'm going to run to the bathroom, but I will be right back.

24
00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.989
That.

25
00:01:43.989 --> 00:02:07.439
You like your gift.
