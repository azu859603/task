00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.169
I'm waiting for these buds for two years, but as soon as your petals bloom, I'll be able

2
00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:22.260
to awaken my wolf spirit in six months.

3
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.260
Lucky you.

4
00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.420
I'm dying in the arena, huh?

5
00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:26.480
You're all right.

6
00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.670
Aren't you every?

7
00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:34.880
Thanks, Alpha Logan.

8
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:35.880
For your blessing?

9
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:36.880
Stubborn, as always.

10
00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:37.880
You missed the arena already.

11
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:38.880
Please me.

12
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:39.880
And this premium cure could be yours.

13
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:41.880
No need.

14
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:49.859
I have my herbs.

15
00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:50.859
Ungrateful.

16
00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:51.859
You are asking.

17
00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:54.140
What?

18
00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.299
It's the Alpha of the Silver Streak Pack.

19
00:00:56.299 --> 00:01:01.020
People call him the Heartless Alpha.

20
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.500
Kill your own pack, member?

21
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:18.159
There'll be some before our werewolf tribunal.

22
00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:19.159
I'm not killing anybody.

23
00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:25.489
She's not going to die from a little trip, right Avery?

24
00:01:25.489 --> 00:01:27.939
I'm fine, thank you.

25
00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:28.939
You're that.

26
00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:29.939
She's fine.

27
00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.939
So maybe you should mine your own pack.

28
00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:32.939
I'm fine.

29
00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:33.939
I'm fine.

30
00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:34.939
I'm fine.

31
00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:36.609
I'm fine.

32
00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:37.609
I'm fine.

33
00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:46.469
So maybe you should mine your own pack of fairs, Alpha Ryan.

34
00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:47.469
Oh yeah, Alpha.

35
00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:50.109
Listen, I forget why we're here.

36
00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:53.109
You don't want to get kicked down before you find your name.

37
00:01:53.109 --> 00:02:00.030
Of course, Alpha Logan.

38
00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.700
I just have some work to do through the night.

39
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.340
I thought maybe she could serve me.

40
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.340
You wouldn't deny a request for my guests, right?
