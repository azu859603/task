00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.309
Be careful.

2
00:00:05.309 --> 00:00:07.469
I'm so sorry. I messed up.

3
00:00:07.469 --> 00:00:15.619
How is this possible?

4
00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:19.260
I'm so sorry. I should just go find someone else to serve you.

5
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.260
No. Kitten. I'm sorry. I, uh, I didn't mean to startle you.

6
00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
I all thought it was me. I...

7
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.449
Did you call me kitten?

8
00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.449
I have to call you something, don't I?

9
00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:31.739
You can call me Avery.

10
00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:34.090
Okay. Avery.

11
00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.179
What's your full name, Avery?

12
00:00:37.179 --> 00:00:40.429
I don't. I was an orphan.

13
00:00:40.429 --> 00:00:45.030
And the late Alpha just gave me Avery.

14
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.030
I'll call you kitten then.

15
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.659
Okay. Where would you like me to get started?

16
00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:56.640
Let's go to bed.

17
00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.500
What?
