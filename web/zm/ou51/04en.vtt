00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:06.070
I mean, you go to bed and get some rest and I'll finish my work.

2
00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:09.070
No, I'm fine, really.

3
00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:10.070
I won't do anything, don't worry.

4
00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:18.420
No, it's not that, it's just I'm here to serve you and my alpha wouldn't like it if I slack off.

5
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.809
Okay, well, take a seat at least.

6
00:00:21.809 --> 00:00:26.809
It's making me a little nervous with you standing there, like you're overseeing my work.

7
00:00:26.809 --> 00:00:37.579
Here, go ahead.

8
00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:39.579
He's responsible and gentle.

9
00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:58.859
Not like the Heartless Alpha he's made out to be.

10
00:00:58.859 --> 00:00:59.859
I'm not hungry.

11
00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:02.439
You can have these.

12
00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:04.950
No, I'm an Omega.

13
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.980
Omega's aren't allowed to have pastries in Red Moon.

14
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.980
Omega's are only allowed to have scraps in Red Moon Pack.

15
00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.849
Isn't that common?

16
00:01:13.849 --> 00:01:16.359
No, of course not.

17
00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:18.359
In my pack, everybody's equal here.

18
00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:20.359
We enjoy all kinds of foods.

19
00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:23.030
Here, take it.

20
00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:48.680
Brian has never wanted a girl.

21
00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:49.680
I saw it.

22
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.540
Avery's doomed.

23
00:01:53.540 --> 00:02:02.790
Alpha Logan is coming to your rescue.
