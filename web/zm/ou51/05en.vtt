00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.939
What are you doing?

2
00:00:12.939 --> 00:00:13.939
I'm so sorry.

3
00:00:13.939 --> 00:00:14.939
Alpha Logan.

4
00:00:14.939 --> 00:00:17.780
I've heard of knocking before entering someone's room.

5
00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.780
Excuse me, Alpha Ryan, I just need to discipline this unruly Omega.

6
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:23.780
You're good for nothing out there.

7
00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:25.780
You'd be so close to Alpha Ryan.

8
00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.809
She didn't do anything wrong.

9
00:00:27.809 --> 00:00:32.429
Everything's been satisfactory.

10
00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:33.429
She can go now.

11
00:00:33.429 --> 00:00:36.740
Let's start now.

12
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:44.659
I'll walk you back.

13
00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:45.880
Damn it.

14
00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:46.880
Doesn't want a woman near him.

15
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:47.880
Bullshit!

16
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:55.289
Alpha.

17
00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:02.409
Got that maid's phone number.

18
00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:04.629
Who is this?

19
00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.109
I'm the maid you've never met before.

20
00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:09.500
Your maid's weakness to me.

21
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.310
Yes, sir.

22
00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:14.310
I'll send it to you now.

23
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.629
All right.

24
00:01:15.629 --> 00:01:35.780
Logan, you should kick this thief out of the pack.

25
00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.290
For Logan, I didn't do anything.

26
00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.290
Kiss my ring.

27
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.409
And all will be forgiven.

28
00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.409
But I didn't do anything.

29
00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:46.409
Why would I apologize?

30
00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.409
I am your Alpha.

31
00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:50.409
Disobated me and I will have you banished from this pack.

32
00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:52.409
Logan, you can't be serious.

33
00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.409
She's a thief.

34
00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:54.409
You can't forgive her.

35
00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:59.569
Don't tell me you actually have feelings for her and intend for her to become your Luna.

36
00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:02.569
My father promised you to marry Logan before he died.

37
00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:04.569
You're not marrying my brother.

38
00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:05.569
Get out.

39
00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:06.569
I don't even care.

40
00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:08.860
I don't want to be in this pack.

41
00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.759
Stop.

42
00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:15.759
You're not taking anything I've given you.

43
00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:17.759
Look at that food or anything else.

44
00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:32.879
End your clothes.
