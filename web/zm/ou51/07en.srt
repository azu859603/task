1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,780
You should apologize to her.

2
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:08,849
Kim, are you okay?

3
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:12,429
Alpha Ryan, what now?

4
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:14,269
We just checked the security footage.

5
00:00:14,269 --> 00:00:17,230
Your sister took the necklace up to the attic.

6
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:24,899
She framed her.

7
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:27,210
Now, apologize to her.

8
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,940
Mm-hmm-hmm.

9
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,659
Well, now that all that's cleared up,

10
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:34,420
you can actually be mad, Luna.

11
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:36,700
I would never be here, Luna.

12
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,500
I'm calling off the engagement.

13
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,020
Do you realize what you just said?

14
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,500
I said, I'm never gonna be bullied by this pack again.

15
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,740
You're where you're gonna go.

16
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:44,740
Anywhere.

17
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:46,609
You felt good for nothing.

18
00:00:46,609 --> 00:00:50,149
Nobody will take you in but me.

19
00:00:50,149 --> 00:00:51,149
I will.
