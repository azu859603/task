1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,659
I couldn't join my pack.

2
00:00:01,659 --> 00:00:04,660
Being a part of my pack, you don't have to worry about food,

3
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:08,060
or clothes, and we never pick on the week.

4
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:09,660
No, you're not going anywhere.

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,839
You know, the rumor is about him, right?

6
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:13,359
He's heartless.

7
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:14,519
You're just a worthless Omega.

8
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:17,789
You will suffer in his back.

9
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:22,010
I'm going with him.

10
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:37,520
He'll be happier there.

11
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,890
Okay, Avery.

12
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:48,289
Gonna leave this place with dignity.

13
00:00:48,289 --> 00:00:49,590
Yeah, I almost forgot.
