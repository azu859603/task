1
00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.560
Caden, where's the medicine?

2
00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.559
Alpha, I'm at the pharmacy now. I'll bring it back right away.

3
00:00:06.719 --> 00:00:07.719
Alright, good.

4
00:00:07.719 --> 00:00:11.099
Ryan, have you lost your mind?

5
00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.099
How could you take her to the pack?

6
00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:14.099
Something wrong?

7
00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.219
Being wolfless and frail, she'll be your burden.

8
00:00:17.219 --> 00:00:21.219
Enough! I'm an Alpha. I won't let that happen.

9
00:00:21.219 --> 00:00:27.030
Kid, you're coming around.

10
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.030
What happened to me?

11
00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:31.320
You haven't been to many cars, have you?

12
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.380
Motion sickness.

13
00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.789
Alpha, Ryan, there's something I need to talk to you about.

14
00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:40.020
Just Ryan.

15
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:48.729
Okay. The truth is, I never planned on joining your back.

16
00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:54.530
I just wanted to make Alpha Logan back off, so once I'm feeling better, I'll be gone for good.

17
00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:55.530
Why?

18
00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.530
Because I don't have a wolf.

19
00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.140
Alpha Logan's always telling me how much of a burden I am.

20
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.579
And if I join your pack, I'm not going to be any help.

21
00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:06.579
No. That's not true.

22
00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:09.840
You're smart, brave.

23
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:10.840
You have a green thumb.

24
00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.840
In my eyes, you're a tough girl.

25
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:13.840
I am.

26
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.959
Of course.

27
00:01:15.959 --> 00:01:20.230
Kid, my pack needs you.

28
00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.340
I need you.

29
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.459
I've ever kissed a guy before.

30
00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:39.019
Alpha, I got home.

31
00:01:39.019 --> 00:01:43.019
Oh, man, I didn't see anything, but I got the medicine.

32
00:01:43.019 --> 00:01:44.019
Alright.

33
00:01:44.019 --> 00:01:45.019
Good job.

34
00:01:45.019 --> 00:01:46.019
Get him there.

35
00:01:46.019 --> 00:01:48.409
What is wrong with me?

36
00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:50.409
Just face reality.

37
00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:52.920
He's way out of my league.

38
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.980
Get the wolf and leave his pack.

39
00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:55.980
That's the deal.

40
00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.750
Sorry, I don't know what happened.

41
00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.549
Here.

42
00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:04.950
Get some rest.

43
00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:13.659
Alpha.

44
00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:16.659
Hey, are we hitting the road tomorrow morning?

45
00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:18.659
If so, I'll sort out your schedules by a minute.

46
00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:19.659
I got you.

47
00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:20.659
Now, she's two weeks take the journey.

48
00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:21.659
Set out in two days.

49
00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:22.659
Alpha.

50
00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:25.689
You're in trouble?

51
00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:28.099
What's wrong?

52
00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:29.479
You're in love.

53
00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:31.479
I mean, you don't even care about your work anymore.

54
00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:36.479
You know, the attraction between you and Miss Avery, it's one of a mate bond.

55
00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:38.479
Well, sadly, she's not my mate.

56
00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:39.479
Yeah.

57
00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:41.580
You know, she's much better than your mate.

58
00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.539
You should tell your feelings.

59
00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:48.009
I still haven't cut ties with that woman.

60
00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:50.039
It'll be unfair to Avery if I told her how I felt.

61
00:02:50.039 --> 00:03:14.689
It's been a whole day.

62
00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:16.689
My mate should be all settled in.

63
00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:26.419
I'm not ready yet.

64
00:03:26.419 --> 00:03:31.340
I see what you're planning.

65
00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.370
I'm warning you.

66
00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:34.370
You have three days.

67
00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:35.370
Name a time and place.

68
00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.620
You got it!

69
00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:44.479
Sorry, sorry.

70
00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:46.479
Wait, is she really my mate?

71
00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:47.479
Can I help you?

72
00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:49.479
Sorry, I should have knocked.

73
00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:50.479
It's okay.

74
00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:52.539
No sound.

75
00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:54.110
Damn it.

76
00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:55.620
Got it wrong.

77
00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.219
I was thinking about having you over for dinner.

78
00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:01.219
Okay, you can turn around and...

79
00:04:01.219 --> 00:04:02.219
just...

80
00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:06.430
Why are you in clothes?

81
00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.129
Well, they're the best I have.

82
00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:14.439
Caden, do you have them ready?

83
00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:15.659
Yeah.

84
00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:16.660
Give me a dress.

85
00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:17.660
Do you want them at now?

86
00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:18.660
Yeah, bring them.

87
00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:19.660
Okay.

88
00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:27.100
They're beautiful.

89
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.100
Did you clean out a princess's closet?

90
00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.100
They're all yours?

91
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.100
Really?

92
00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.829
I hear every girl dreams of being a princess.

93
00:04:34.829 --> 00:04:37.019
I hope you like them.

94
00:04:37.019 --> 00:04:39.250
I mean, yeah, but...

95
00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.250
I'm not princess material.

96
00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.660
I'm just a woofless Omega.

97
00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:48.660
Caden, in my eyes, you are a princess.

98
00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:55.819
Okay, I'll try mine.

99
00:04:55.819 --> 00:04:56.819
Really charming.

100
00:04:56.819 --> 00:05:04.120
Snap out of it, Avery.

101
00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.410
You're gonna find your own path someday.

102
00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:11.639
Oh, do I look?

103
00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:20.060
I'm God.

104
00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.189
You look like one of those Disney princesses.

105
00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:25.740
Ryan, what do you think?

106
00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:30.399
Oh, man, our boy is smitten.

107
00:05:30.399 --> 00:05:32.399
You really do look like a princess.

108
00:05:32.399 --> 00:05:37.790
But when'd you get such a honey tongue?

109
00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:40.339
Would you have somewhere to be?

110
00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:41.339
No, man.

111
00:05:41.339 --> 00:05:43.980
I'm looking forward to more of the fashion show.

112
00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:46.870
Too little to work, I guess.

113
00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:48.350
Classic.

114
00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:51.889
All right.

115
00:05:51.889 --> 00:06:40.889
Sorry.

116
00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:43.660
I didn't mean to scare you.

117
00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:44.660
No, no, it's not that.

118
00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:49.279
I've never done this before.

119
00:06:49.279 --> 00:06:52.529
Why don't you go get some rest?

120
00:06:52.529 --> 00:06:53.529
I'll check on you tomorrow.

121
00:06:53.529 --> 00:07:02.060
I almost lost control there.

122
00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:03.060
Stick to the plan.

123
00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:05.060
Get a wolf and leave.

124
00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:15.709
It does seem like there's some kind of people in this world after all.

125
00:07:15.709 --> 00:07:22.699
I mean, he's nice, handsome, gentle.

126
00:07:22.699 --> 00:07:44.769
I thought there'd be someone that would care about me.

127
00:07:44.769 --> 00:07:51.819
Make me flutter.

128
00:07:51.819 --> 00:07:53.819
Can you believe it?

129
00:07:53.819 --> 00:07:56.819
Alpha Ryan has brought a girl back for the first time.

130
00:07:56.819 --> 00:07:58.819
This house is only meant for Luna's.

131
00:07:58.819 --> 00:08:01.819
Is Alpha Ryan planning to let her live here?

132
00:08:01.819 --> 00:08:03.819
Is she our new Luna?

133
00:08:03.819 --> 00:08:06.490
What's up?

134
00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:09.509
Did you hear what they said?

135
00:08:09.509 --> 00:08:10.740
Yeah.

136
00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:12.730
I think they're right.

137
00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:17.019
Don't worry about them.

138
00:08:17.019 --> 00:08:19.410
Seems her wolf hasn't awakened.

139
00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:21.410
The Alpha doesn't even care.

140
00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:23.439
He's be serious.

141
00:08:23.439 --> 00:08:26.439
A top Alpha with a wolfless Luna.

142
00:08:26.439 --> 00:08:29.399
That's actually getting cute.

143
00:08:29.399 --> 00:08:31.399
I've got their daughter wolf.

144
00:08:31.399 --> 00:08:33.200
Oops.

145
00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.200
I'll get you some more.

146
00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:43.169
Get all settled in.

147
00:08:43.169 --> 00:08:44.169
Have a good rest.

148
00:08:44.169 --> 00:08:48.129
Take you for a wellness check tomorrow.

149
00:08:48.129 --> 00:08:50.129
You figure out why your wolf hasn't woken up yet.

150
00:08:50.129 --> 00:08:52.379
It's okay.

151
00:08:52.379 --> 00:08:53.759
They didn't mean it.

152
00:08:53.759 --> 00:08:54.759
And I don't care.

153
00:08:54.759 --> 00:08:56.759
I care about you, kid.

154
00:08:56.759 --> 00:09:01.580
I've been cultivating this for years.

155
00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:04.580
Its blossoms are supposed to help you find your wolf spirit.

156
00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:05.580
It's beautiful.

157
00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:11.159
I'll help you in any way I can.

158
00:09:11.159 --> 00:09:16.039
I'm gonna get some work done.

159
00:09:16.039 --> 00:09:18.419
I'll take you to the hospital tomorrow.

160
00:09:18.419 --> 00:09:21.860
And I'll have some supplies set up.

161
00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:30.259
You gotta find more men?

162
00:09:30.259 --> 00:09:34.720
I smell a lover, boy, and I'm out.

163
00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:37.720
Oh look, it's that Alpha.

164
00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:38.850
Hey, what's up, man?

165
00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:43.850
So, the pack's been abuzz about Miss Avery being your Luna.

166
00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:46.169
Is there a problem with that?

167
00:09:46.169 --> 00:09:48.169
Not with me.

168
00:09:48.169 --> 00:09:50.460
But for your faded mate?

169
00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:52.220
Yeah, maybe.

170
00:09:52.220 --> 00:10:01.769
Alpha.

171
00:10:01.769 --> 00:10:03.769
You got this, man.

172
00:10:03.769 --> 00:10:11.539
Even though there's no moon grass, I have other herbs that can help out the pack.

173
00:10:11.539 --> 00:10:15.529
It's time to pitch in, Avery.

174
00:10:15.529 --> 00:10:23.019
Twelve p.m.

175
00:10:23.019 --> 00:10:31.500
I can't believe the moon goddess set me up with such a ruthless mate.

176
00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:37.600
Can't bring trouble to Ryan's pack, Avery.

177
00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:41.490
I got a separate spot.

178
00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:48.929
That's near the hospital.

179
00:10:48.929 --> 00:10:53.679
This one's good for energy.

180
00:10:53.679 --> 00:10:57.100
And this one's good for hair.

181
00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:58.100
Kid, what are you doing?

182
00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:00.100
We're off to the hospital.

183
00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:02.799
I'm almost done.

184
00:11:02.799 --> 00:11:03.799
What's this?

185
00:11:03.799 --> 00:11:04.799
Which one?

186
00:11:04.799 --> 00:11:20.000
It's okay, it's just a scrape.

187
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
No, that was poison.

188
00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.000
But you're okay now.

189
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.480
Let's go to the hospital.

190
00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:26.480
Yeah, okay.

191
00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:27.480
Avery Blake?

192
00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:39.850
It is Avery Blake here.

193
00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:41.850
Someone has the same given name as me.

194
00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:42.850
Miss Blake?

195
00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:44.580
Here, sorry.

196
00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:46.580
I was just setting up a patient account.

197
00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:47.580
All right.

198
00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:48.580
Thank you.

199
00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:51.610
Listen, Silver Street is your home now.

200
00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:53.610
I have got a family name.

201
00:11:53.610 --> 00:11:55.919
You're no longer alone.

202
00:11:55.919 --> 00:11:56.919
Avery Blake.

203
00:11:56.919 --> 00:11:58.919
But Blake is your surname.

204
00:11:58.919 --> 00:12:00.919
My wife will, of course, take my surname.

205
00:12:00.919 --> 00:12:01.919
Why?

206
00:12:01.919 --> 00:12:03.919
Sooner or later, right?

207
00:12:03.919 --> 00:12:05.950
Oh, my gosh.

208
00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:08.210
I'm falling in love with this name.

209
00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:16.340
Ryan Blake, as I live and breathe, my apologies for forgetting about the surname.

210
00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:18.340
Silver Street is going to have a Luna.

211
00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:23.059
Dr. John?

212
00:12:23.059 --> 00:12:24.419
What's wrong?

213
00:12:24.419 --> 00:12:26.899
Alpha, it's a little complicated.

214
00:12:26.899 --> 00:12:29.730
May we have a moment?

215
00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:40.940
Is there a problem with Avery?

216
00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:43.610
She's fine.

217
00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:47.399
But you're going to have a big problem.

218
00:12:47.399 --> 00:12:48.399
What's going on?

219
00:12:48.399 --> 00:12:49.399
Miss Blake's two weeks.

220
00:12:49.399 --> 00:12:53.399
But as we all know, our spiritual power grows when our mate is around.

221
00:12:53.399 --> 00:12:55.399
She hasn't found her wolf yet.

222
00:12:55.399 --> 00:12:57.559
So that makes finding a mate for her difficult.

223
00:12:57.559 --> 00:12:59.559
I'm sure she's suffered a lot because of this.

224
00:12:59.559 --> 00:13:04.779
Alpha, do you understand what I'm trying to say?

225
00:13:04.779 --> 00:13:05.779
What?

226
00:13:05.779 --> 00:13:07.779
It'll be over between you and Miss Blake

227
00:13:07.779 --> 00:13:09.779
if she finds her mate.

228
00:13:09.779 --> 00:13:17.700
Right on time.

229
00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:27.110
Ryan's going to get nervous if we notice this on my scene.

230
00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:42.360
What do I do?

231
00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:45.360
She needs to meet un-mated werewolves in order to find her mate.

232
00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:47.360
If you're willing to help.

233
00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:49.360
Enough!

234
00:13:52.419 --> 00:13:55.419
This is why I tried to tell you you're going to have a big problem.

235
00:13:55.419 --> 00:13:57.419
Miss Blake's not your mate after all.

236
00:13:57.419 --> 00:13:59.419
So what do I do?

237
00:13:59.419 --> 00:14:01.539
There must be some other way.

238
00:14:02.539 --> 00:14:08.789
Leave your message after the film.

239
00:14:08.789 --> 00:14:10.789
What is wrong with you?

240
00:14:10.789 --> 00:14:12.789
You're the one who wants to cut the bond.

241
00:14:12.789 --> 00:14:14.789
Just say, I love me.

242
00:14:14.789 --> 00:14:20.600
It's been so long.

243
00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:34.470
Kitten, where have you been?

244
00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:36.629
Are you okay?

245
00:14:36.629 --> 00:14:39.820
I can't tell Ryan about the mate thing.

246
00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:40.820
He won't understand.

247
00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:43.820
Yeah, I just got stuffy so I went out for some fresh air.

248
00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:46.519
How are the results?

249
00:14:46.519 --> 00:14:50.090
Um, you're fine.

250
00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:53.269
Here, let's go home.

251
00:14:53.269 --> 00:14:54.269
We need some rest.

252
00:14:54.269 --> 00:15:01.029
Bullshit!

253
00:15:01.029 --> 00:15:03.029
He actually wants me to find her a mate.

254
00:15:03.029 --> 00:15:05.029
But she doesn't have a wolf yet.

255
00:15:05.029 --> 00:15:08.100
So, I mean, it's impossible for her to find a mate, right?

256
00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:12.100
Dr. Johnson, those he-wolves dip their hands in this powder and then shake hands with kitten.

257
00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:15.100
It's supposed to strengthen their mate finding sensibility.

258
00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:19.429
Wonderful.

259
00:15:19.429 --> 00:15:22.659
I mean, think about how many guys she's going to have to shake hands with.

260
00:15:22.659 --> 00:15:24.879
What if they take advantage of them?

261
00:15:24.879 --> 00:15:26.879
No, get yourself together, man.

262
00:15:26.879 --> 00:15:28.879
You're the alpha.

263
00:15:28.879 --> 00:15:31.899
You can control their fates.

264
00:15:31.899 --> 00:15:32.899
It won't work.

265
00:15:32.899 --> 00:15:34.899
What if she can't resist her mate?

266
00:15:34.899 --> 00:15:40.940
I can't believe you're so crazy about a girl.

267
00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:44.700
But it is tricky, though.

268
00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:47.700
Ordinary wolves can't resist the pull of their mate.

269
00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:49.120
Kitten.

270
00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:50.120
Are you awake?

271
00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:57.159
I should have told you, but there actually is a way your wolf can be awakened.

272
00:15:57.159 --> 00:16:01.080
It's just...Kitten?

273
00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:03.490
Kitten.

274
00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:06.019
What happened to you?

275
00:16:06.019 --> 00:16:10.700
A fever.

276
00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:22.690
Your wolf's not awakened yet.

277
00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:33.279
His fever could kill you to transfer my health energy to you.

278
00:16:33.279 --> 00:16:34.279
Kitten.

279
00:16:34.279 --> 00:16:35.279
I'm sorry.

280
00:16:35.279 --> 00:16:36.279
I have to do this.

281
00:16:36.279 --> 00:16:44.610
Forgive me.

282
00:16:44.610 --> 00:17:46.829
Let the shaman divine off her hair.

283
00:17:46.829 --> 00:17:48.829
It might tell us something about her mate.

284
00:17:48.829 --> 00:17:56.569
Alpha, are you sure about this?

285
00:17:56.569 --> 00:18:01.460
You finally have a heartbeat now because of her.

286
00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:08.940
She's too frail to fight off the illness on her own.

287
00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:09.940
Okay.

288
00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:18.220
Ryan, you've made the right choice.

289
00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:20.220
The mates are bound to be together.

290
00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:22.220
And you should go find our mate as well.

291
00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:26.299
Vic, just give it a rest.

292
00:18:26.299 --> 00:18:28.690
I'll never fall in love again.

293
00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:31.619
I'm severing the bomb with her tomorrow.

294
00:18:31.619 --> 00:19:04.660
I think I have feelings for you.

295
00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:17.420
Only you are my mate.

296
00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:20.990
Results from the examination have come in.

297
00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:23.990
The doctor said there's a medicine that will help you recover.

298
00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:28.500
We'll start taking you in for regular check-outs.

299
00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:32.700
It's already now.

300
00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:34.700
They're waiting for Miss Avery.

301
00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:35.700
What's going on?

302
00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:37.700
Get dressed and come downstairs.

303
00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:46.259
Time to meet some new friends in the pack.

304
00:19:46.259 --> 00:19:47.259
You friends?

305
00:19:47.259 --> 00:19:50.380
Why are they all he-wolves?

306
00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:53.900
Oh, that's because everyone else was busy.

307
00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:54.900
Yeah, busy.

308
00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:56.950
We'll go ahead.

309
00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:57.950
Shake everyone's hands.

310
00:19:57.950 --> 00:19:58.950
Get to know each other.

311
00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:07.029
I'm Avery.

312
00:20:07.029 --> 00:20:14.829
The shaman said that Miss Avery's mate will have

313
00:20:14.829 --> 00:20:17.829
in a bunch of single dark-haired he-wolves

314
00:20:17.829 --> 00:20:21.410
if we don't find them just fighting the search.

315
00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:26.069
However, you have dark...

316
00:20:26.069 --> 00:20:28.069
I mean, what is a shaman now?

317
00:20:28.069 --> 00:20:32.750
What is a shaman?

318
00:20:32.750 --> 00:21:00.190
You know what I'm supposed to do today?

319
00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:01.579
It's a bad day.

320
00:21:01.579 --> 00:21:04.660
As she found in her, I gotta tell an alpha.

321
00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:22.019
That...

322
00:21:22.019 --> 00:21:23.019
What the hell is she doing?

323
00:21:23.019 --> 00:21:24.660
Petty revenge?

324
00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:34.549
I'm in her trouble.

325
00:21:34.549 --> 00:21:38.500
Except my kitten.

326
00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:52.220
Is she doing this on purpose?

327
00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:53.220
You smell like moon grass.

328
00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:54.220
Can you take me to where you get it?

329
00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:56.250
It's really important to me.

330
00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:57.250
I smell the same on you.

331
00:21:57.250 --> 00:21:58.250
Of course.

332
00:21:58.250 --> 00:21:59.250
I-I can take you to find them now.

333
00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:03.579
Okay.

334
00:22:03.579 --> 00:22:05.569
It's Ryan.

335
00:22:05.569 --> 00:22:06.569
He's really busy.

336
00:22:06.569 --> 00:22:10.680
Devious woman.

337
00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:11.680
Answer my calls.

338
00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:16.200
Hey!

339
00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:18.200
I'm gonna answer my calls, bro.

340
00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:20.259
Follow me, okay?

341
00:22:20.259 --> 00:22:21.259
Come on.

342
00:22:21.259 --> 00:22:22.259
We gotta go.

343
00:22:22.259 --> 00:22:23.259
Your phone works.

344
00:22:23.259 --> 00:22:28.519
Okay.

345
00:22:28.519 --> 00:22:29.519
Brother.

346
00:22:29.519 --> 00:22:31.519
No way they've got enough to...

347
00:22:31.519 --> 00:22:36.710
Mate.

348
00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:37.710
Yeah, here's the garden.

349
00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:39.710
I have like 15 different herbs here.

350
00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:40.710
There's a moon grass.

351
00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:44.529
Moon grass!

352
00:22:44.529 --> 00:22:45.529
Thank you, Keys.

353
00:22:45.529 --> 00:22:48.779
I'll definitely be able to wake up my wolf spirit with this.

354
00:22:48.779 --> 00:22:51.910
Alpha's out there looking for your mate.

355
00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:53.910
Your wolf will be awakened by that.

356
00:22:53.910 --> 00:22:56.769
Right?

357
00:22:56.769 --> 00:23:08.099
He didn't tell me that.

358
00:23:08.099 --> 00:23:10.839
Stupid Ryan.

359
00:23:10.839 --> 00:23:13.839
Kisses me and sends me off with another man.

360
00:23:18.549 --> 00:23:26.019
I'll, uh, I'll take this one.

361
00:23:26.019 --> 00:23:27.019
Thank you.

362
00:23:27.019 --> 00:23:31.900
You finally got a smile.

363
00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:34.990
I'm fine.

364
00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:35.990
Thank you.

365
00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:45.220
How about...

366
00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:46.220
Zina?

367
00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:48.220
Do you like the name for the baby?

368
00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:49.220
It's beautiful.

369
00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:51.569
I'll take good care of her.

370
00:23:51.569 --> 00:23:52.569
Please do, though.

371
00:23:52.569 --> 00:23:55.049
A lot of work to come by.

372
00:23:55.049 --> 00:23:57.299
Zina?

373
00:23:57.299 --> 00:23:59.299
They already picked that in the name for their future baby.

374
00:23:59.299 --> 00:24:01.000
Shit.

375
00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.000
Are we too late?

376
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.019
Okay.

377
00:24:05.019 --> 00:24:08.900
Ryan, what's wrong with you?

378
00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:09.900
No, what the hell?

379
00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:10.900
Kids want me back, man?

380
00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:11.900
You forget what I tell you, man.

381
00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:12.900
Come on.

382
00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:15.900
I don't care if you're her mate or whatever.

383
00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:19.900
Your job is to stay by her side and enhance her spirit.

384
00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:24.859
As for the child, I will raise it.

385
00:24:24.859 --> 00:24:29.630
Child?

386
00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:31.430
What child?

387
00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:34.059
Zina.

388
00:24:34.059 --> 00:24:35.900
Alpha.

389
00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:38.309
Zina is the puppy doll.

390
00:24:38.309 --> 00:24:40.410
And I'm not Miss Blake's mate.

391
00:24:40.410 --> 00:24:43.759
We just happen to like studying herbs.

392
00:24:43.759 --> 00:24:46.789
Ooh, that's weird.

393
00:24:46.789 --> 00:24:48.789
Yo, let's get you out of here, man.

394
00:24:48.789 --> 00:24:49.789
Sorry, bro.

395
00:24:49.789 --> 00:24:50.789
You're good, man.

396
00:24:50.789 --> 00:24:57.549
Are you happy?

397
00:24:57.549 --> 00:25:04.089
People are watching.

398
00:25:04.089 --> 00:25:07.809
Which one do you want?

399
00:25:07.809 --> 00:25:14.740
I'm trying to get the big one all day, but...

400
00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:16.130
I mean...

401
00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:17.740
Here.

402
00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:18.740
Let me teach you how.

403
00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:27.099
What are you looking at me for?

404
00:25:27.099 --> 00:25:28.099
Focus.

405
00:25:28.099 --> 00:25:47.920
Just kiss.

406
00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:57.500
Just kiss.

407
00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:29.890
Thanks, Ryan.

408
00:26:29.890 --> 00:26:33.660
I honestly never had a day like that before.

409
00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:38.890
Kitten, you deserve it.

410
00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:39.890
Marcus.

411
00:26:39.890 --> 00:26:40.890
Zina.

412
00:26:40.890 --> 00:26:42.109
Play nice.

413
00:26:42.109 --> 00:26:44.849
Kitten.

414
00:26:44.849 --> 00:26:49.059
Do you like Keith?

415
00:26:49.059 --> 00:26:54.410
I like you.

416
00:26:54.410 --> 00:26:56.269
Thank you.
