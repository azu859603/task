1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Right.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,060
Better not tell him.

3
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:05,440
Hi, kitten.

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,440
Hey.

5
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,679
I was just going to take a look at the wedding outfits.

6
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:11,039
What are you doing here?

7
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:16,440
Uh, I am here for arrangements.

8
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,269
Oh.

9
00:00:18,269 --> 00:00:19,269
Let's go together.

10
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:23,339
Sure.

11
00:00:23,339 --> 00:00:25,339
Something's come up today.

12
00:00:25,339 --> 00:00:26,339
Can't make it.

13
00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:27,339
Let's re-skit.

14
00:00:27,339 --> 00:00:28,339
Sorry.

15
00:00:28,339 --> 00:00:29,339
Got something important to handle.

16
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:30,339
Can't make it today.

17
00:00:30,339 --> 00:00:38,259
So, wedding outfits first?

18
00:00:38,259 --> 00:00:39,259
Sure.

19
00:00:39,259 --> 00:00:43,259
You'd look amazing in any outfit, so I ordered all of them.

20
00:00:43,259 --> 00:00:44,259
Thank you.

21
00:00:44,259 --> 00:00:50,530
The names are nice to me.

22
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:57,359
She's never been so gentle with me.

23
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:02,320
Kitten, I plucked the stars from the sky for you.

24
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,829
Ryan, I love you.

25
00:01:04,829 --> 00:01:06,760
I will be more.

26
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:12,409
Ava, you're mine.

27
00:01:12,409 --> 00:01:15,409
I'm not going to let anyone take you away from me.
