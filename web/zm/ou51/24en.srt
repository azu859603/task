00:00:01,169 --> 00:00:09,990
Hello? Who is this?

2
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:11,990
Avery. How are you?

3
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:14,060
Logan. What do you want?

4
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:16,059
What kind of reaction is that?

5
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:18,280
It's the middle of the night.

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,280
What kind of reaction am I supposed to have?

7
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,280
If it's not important, I'm hanging up. I don't want Ryan to get the wrong idea.

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,539
I can wake up your wolf spirit right now.

9
00:00:25,539 --> 00:00:26,539
What did you say?

10
00:00:26,539 --> 00:00:29,890
Meet me at Saint Mount, 12am tomorrow.

11
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:38,549
I...are you.

12
00:00:38,549 --> 00:00:43,079
Avery, I'm waiting for you.

13
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:45,079
Alpha Logan, what?

14
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:47,079
Don't need to call me Alpha.

15
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:51,240
I'm just the same Logan. I'm our child.

16
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,240
The same Logan from our childhood who made my life a living hell?

17
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,240
I'm sorry.

18
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,850
I forgot I don't know what to say.

19
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:03,219
But I do now realize I'm in love with you.

20
00:01:03,219 --> 00:01:05,219
You're in love with me.

21
00:01:05,219 --> 00:01:06,349
Are you joking?
