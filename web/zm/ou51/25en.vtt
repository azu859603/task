1
00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:04.410
I can offer you all that Ryan promised and more.

2
00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:10.519
I'm going to turn Red Moon into the largest pack on this continent, and you can be yarny now.

3
00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:14.019
I'm not an idiot. I know you and Garnet hate me.

4
00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:17.050
Well, guess what? The feeling is mutual.

5
00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.649
You hate me?

6
00:00:20.649 --> 00:00:23.149
Yes, and I never want to see you again.

7
00:00:23.149 --> 00:00:26.800
That's the truth.

8
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:27.800
Yes.

9
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.439
I see.

10
00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:41.329
Wait! You never told me how to wake up my wolf spirit!

11
00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:46.939
Garnet?

12
00:00:47.439 --> 00:00:49.939
Avery, perhaps I can help?

13
00:00:49.939 --> 00:00:51.939
Why would you be nice to me now?

14
00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:53.939
Because I'm sick of you hanging around.

15
00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:57.039
I'll help you find your wolf spirit.

16
00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:03.799
I mean, you can run along with your little mate, and be out of my life and my brothers forever.

17
00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:06.760
Deal? Deal!

18
00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:07.989
Follow me.

19
00:01:07.989 --> 00:01:17.810
My dad said he found you in the woods, glowing all over.

20
00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.159
But the moment he picked you up, the glow vanished.

21
00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:25.480
Maybe the secret to your wolf is hidden in there.

22
00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.659
So my parents used to live there? You shouldn't go find out.

23
00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:58.290
Just a bit of wolf Spain. Enjoy!

24
00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.290
Wolf Spain?

25
00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:23.360
Avery, wake up.

26
00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:30.360
We save us. Can't hold on any longer.

27
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:44.080
Our mate is in danger.

28
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.189
Sense it. What if it's another trick?

29
00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:50.189
What if it's real?

30
00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:52.349
Ryan, it's a life.

31
00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:55.960
All right. Saver, and cut them on.

32
00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:07.680
Are you here to see me?

33
00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:08.680
Get off.

34
00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:18.159
Avery, wake up.

35
00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:47.240
You're reaping. You suck!

36
00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.240
No mate, no!

37
00:03:48.240 --> 00:04:15.080
Doctor, you have to save her.

38
00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.079
Alpha, the wolf's manes gone deep into her bones.

39
00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:19.079
There's nothing more.

40
00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:20.079
You have to.

41
00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:25.029
You're the best doctor in North America, right?

42
00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:26.029
Saver!

43
00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:27.509
Alpha, it's wolf Spain.

44
00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:28.509
I don't care.

45
00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:30.990
Do what it takes, Saver!

46
00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:35.800
Quark. Get out.

47
00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.889
Get out.

48
00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:38.889
Everybody, get out!

49
00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:55.560
We haven't held the loonus here in the morning yet.

50
00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.449
Oh, my God.

51
00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:02.160
It's all too late.

52
00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:32.870
Alpha, tire pack.

53
00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:37.110
I made a promise to my parents.

54
00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:38.110
I'd take care of this pack.

55
00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:48.629
But I also made a promise that I'd protect kitten.

56
00:05:48.629 --> 00:06:01.990
This is our entire business.

57
00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:10.939
The pack's stable for 300 years.

58
00:06:10.939 --> 00:06:14.600
And this way, I can go and save her,

59
00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.629
knowing it's in good hands.

60
00:06:17.629 --> 00:06:31.339
The right hands.

61
00:06:31.339 --> 00:06:32.339
It just died.

62
00:06:32.339 --> 00:07:10.180
Kate in the face.

63
00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:12.240
Okay.

64
00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:21.180
Where's Ryan?

65
00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:26.689
Saverie.

66
00:07:26.689 --> 00:07:41.000
Alpha is outside waiting for you.

67
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.649
Take me to home.

68
00:07:44.649 --> 00:08:07.480
This isn't a funny joke.

69
00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:10.279
It's not a joke.

70
00:08:10.279 --> 00:08:25.230
Alpha, he absorbed all the wolfsbane to save you.

71
00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:26.230
But it's dead.

72
00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:28.959
And we should let him rest.

73
00:08:28.959 --> 00:08:35.549
No, he saved me and I could do the same for him.

74
00:08:35.549 --> 00:08:36.549
Tell me how.

75
00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:37.549
No, no.

76
00:08:37.549 --> 00:08:43.279
The shaman said that only alphas can use that method.

77
00:08:43.279 --> 00:08:46.279
And it's a one-time deal.

78
00:08:46.279 --> 00:08:52.600
You said you're always gonna be there.

79
00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:53.600
Calm down.

80
00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:54.600
Get off me.

81
00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:55.629
You promised.

82
00:08:55.629 --> 00:08:56.629
Miss Avery, calm down.

83
00:08:56.629 --> 00:08:57.629
Get off me!

84
00:09:04.679 --> 00:09:07.000
The Silver Wolf spirit.

85
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.830
It appears once every one hundred years.

86
00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:11.830
Is none of them.

87
00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:26.960
Have the strongest wolf spirit.

88
00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:35.460
You are our last hope to save Alpha Ryan.

89
00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:39.460
They say the Silver Wolf is the strongest of all healing powers.

90
00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:44.480
And the Silver Glow is a blessing to all beings.

91
00:09:44.480 --> 00:10:52.159
Alpha, come back to us.

92
00:10:52.159 --> 00:10:53.159
It's so funny.

93
00:10:53.159 --> 00:10:56.600
You almost died.

94
00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:00.360
What was I supposed to do without you?

95
00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:05.490
But I'm still kicking, aren't I?

96
00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:09.519
In my wildest dreams did I think of my little kitten.

97
00:11:09.519 --> 00:11:11.519
It would be a once-in-a-century wolf.

98
00:11:11.519 --> 00:11:15.679
I'm a pretty lucky guy to have a Silver Wolf Luna.

99
00:11:15.679 --> 00:11:16.679
Aren't I?

100
00:11:16.679 --> 00:11:19.710
You already have the strongest pack in North America.

101
00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:21.710
You don't need a Silver Wolf.

102
00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:25.210
I don't.

103
00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:26.210
I just need you.

104
00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:30.899
I'm clean because of you.

105
00:11:30.899 --> 00:11:38.679
The Heartless Alpha claims to be incomplete.

106
00:11:38.679 --> 00:11:50.649
By Heartless, the truth is I was actually born without a heart.

107
00:11:50.649 --> 00:11:52.649
This is the gift that you gave me.

108
00:11:52.649 --> 00:11:59.129
So this watch is...

109
00:11:59.129 --> 00:12:02.710
Was... your heart.

110
00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:08.429
I always wondered why you carried it around.

111
00:12:08.429 --> 00:12:14.039
Kitten, what do you make?

112
00:12:14.039 --> 00:12:18.659
What do you mean?

113
00:12:18.659 --> 00:12:22.289
Let's hold the Luna ceremony tomorrow.

114
00:12:22.289 --> 00:12:25.700
I don't want to wait till next month.

115
00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:27.240
Tomorrow.

116
00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:29.240
After everything that's happened,

117
00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:31.240
I can't bear the thought of being away from you.

118
00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:36.759
I'm for a second.

119
00:12:36.759 --> 00:12:38.759
I haven't broken up with my faded mate yet.

120
00:12:38.759 --> 00:12:40.820
Okay.

121
00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:45.159
I know what you're worried about.

122
00:12:45.159 --> 00:12:50.929
But your wolf spirit has awakened.

123
00:12:50.929 --> 00:12:51.929
It's you.

124
00:12:51.929 --> 00:12:56.769
It's us.

125
00:12:56.769 --> 00:13:28.889
Alpha of Silver Street Pack.

126
00:13:28.889 --> 00:13:29.889
Take you.

127
00:13:29.889 --> 00:13:32.120
Avery Blake.

128
00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:33.120
As my Luna.

129
00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:35.490
And I.

130
00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:38.289
Avery Blake.

131
00:13:38.289 --> 00:13:39.289
Take you.

132
00:13:39.289 --> 00:13:40.289
Ryan Blake.

133
00:13:40.289 --> 00:13:42.250
As my Alpha.
