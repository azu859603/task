00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.339
Please, mow me.

2
00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.459
This is my husband.

3
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.710
You're her husband.

4
00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.740
You conniving little bitch.

5
00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.740
You think you can just grab some random guy off the street

6
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.239
and call him your husband?

7
00:00:17.239 --> 00:00:19.739
I mean, come on, look at yourself, huh?

8
00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:22.910
Hey, stay away from my wife.

9
00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.410
Oh, so she's actually your wife?

10
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.420
And he would love to kick your ass.

11
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.490
Oh, okay.

12
00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:35.990
Let me give you a little advice, buddy.

13
00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.490
Girls that look like that, dress like that,

14
00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:41.990
they like to have sex for money, okay?

15
00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.490
And I'm pretty sure she's got plenty of guys in her back pocket.

16
00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.490
She can dress however she wants.

17
00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:48.490
It's your mind out of the gutter.

18
00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:52.469
You disgust me.

19
00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:59.460
Okay, she's all yours.

20
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.460
Oh, there's no need to thank him.

21
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.460
We're family now, right?

22
00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.329
Family?

23
00:01:06.329 --> 00:01:08.329
Grandma, it's not what you think.

24
00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:10.329
I heard what you said.

25
00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:12.329
I've been divorced now for two years.

26
00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:16.329
Your parents are still waiting for a new proposal,

27
00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:20.329
times ticking and going to be home from their trip next month.

28
00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:22.420
Grandma, it's not what you think.

29
00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.519
What if she's like all the girls?

30
00:01:24.519 --> 00:01:26.549
You know my ex-wife.

31
00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:32.549
And I happen to also have the best instincts, Ethan.

32
00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.780
My instincts are never wrong.

33
00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.780
I like this girl.

34
00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.780
Here's the plan.

35
00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:40.780
Married.

36
00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:41.780
Right now.

37
00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.099
Before I kick the bucket.

38
00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:45.099
Married?
