1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,830
What's this woman's deal that Dionne Hotel is the most expensive five-star hotel in America?

2
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:08,960
Is she testing me?

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,179
I'm just a security guard.

4
00:00:11,179 --> 00:00:13,179
How can I ever afford a place like that?

5
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:15,630
If you want a honeymoon there, you can just forget it.

6
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:28,579
Hey, there's a gift shop right there.

7
00:00:28,579 --> 00:00:30,579
We should grab something real quick.

8
00:00:30,579 --> 00:00:35,579
Already showing your true gold digging colors just after one day of marriage.

9
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:38,579
You go ahead. I'm going to park the car across the street.

10
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:45,320
A gold digger. I knew it.

11
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,320
Let's see how you handle things when you can't pay.

12
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,320
Just a matter of time before you come crawling back.

13
00:00:50,320 --> 00:01:02,369
Excuse me, ma'am.

14
00:01:02,369 --> 00:01:07,390
That scarf is $1,800.

15
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:11,379
Do you have a discount?

16
00:01:11,379 --> 00:01:15,379
This is a luxury store, not a flea market.

17
00:01:15,379 --> 00:01:20,379
If you're looking for something cheaper, there's a general store down the street.
