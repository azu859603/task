1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.139
Are you okay?

2
00:00:04.139 --> 00:00:06.139
Yeah, I'm good. Are you okay?

3
00:00:06.139 --> 00:00:08.939
Yeah, you just scared me.

4
00:00:08.939 --> 00:00:10.939
Gosh, wait!

5
00:00:10.939 --> 00:00:26.739
This is your place. It's huge.

6
00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:30.739
I can't tell her who I really am until I know I can trust her.

7
00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:32.740
Uh, it's, uh, rented.

8
00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.740
You must have some rich parents to rent a place this big.

9
00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:40.740
Uh, it's my friend's place. He's abroad right now, and he's letting me stay here.

10
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.740
Oh, how much?

11
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:48.579
One, two...

12
00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:50.969
Two thousand?

13
00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.969
Two, yeah, yeah.

14
00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:56.969
Oh, my God, you guys must be best friends.

15
00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.969
We're practically related.

16
00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:17.540
It's a thousand.

17
00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.400
May I have...

18
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.400
You want to split the rent with me?

19
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.879
Yeah.

20
00:01:24.879 --> 00:01:27.879
If we're a couple, we should go fifty-fifty.

21
00:01:27.879 --> 00:01:31.549
All right. I'll set her aside.

22
00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:33.060
Wow.

23
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.260
She doesn't even go there after all.

24
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.370
What? What?

25
00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.370
Oh, curious. You said all this money by yourself?

26
00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.530
Yeah, I'm trying to open a bakery.

27
00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.530
I think I'm almost there.

28
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.489
So is Box you're obsessed with?

29
00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:57.189
It's all for opening a bakery.

30
00:01:57.189 --> 00:01:59.930
So my biggest dream.

31
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.930
What a genuinely ambitious girl.

32
00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.090
I've got her all wrong.

33
00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:23.939
So sorry. I forgot to tell you that I got married.

34
00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:24.939
What?

35
00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:27.479
And I moved in with my husband.

36
00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:32.479
Once the dust settles, I've got to find the time to tell her who I really am.

37
00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:37.930
Thank you so much for letting me stay with you these past three years.

38
00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.300
Married to rich in the heat.

39
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.840
I will tell you later. I gotta go.

40
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:52.259
So Ms. Pearl, do you help unpacking?

41
00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:54.650
Ms. Pearl.

42
00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:25.310
I'm really impressed.

43
00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.439
Where'd you learn to do all that stuff?

44
00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:31.659
My mom, she passed away.

45
00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:34.340
I know as a kid.

46
00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.590
So I had to rely on myself for my most of my life.

47
00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.590
Taught myself all those things.

48
00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.469
Well, you have me now, Pearl.

49
00:03:44.469 --> 00:04:06.129
Something around won't be alone anymore.

50
00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:07.129
Water the lawn.

51
00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:35.779
That adorable.

52
00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:36.779
I've got this.

53
00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:49.129
Someone is very comfortable in their skin.

54
00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:52.129
Taking your shirt off in front of me.

55
00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:53.129
You were just staring at me to go.

56
00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:54.129
Why so shy now?

57
00:04:55.829 --> 00:04:57.829
I wasn't staring.

58
00:04:57.829 --> 00:05:00.220
I was just caught off guard.

59
00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:06.579
Why don't you take a picture of the last longer?

60
00:05:06.579 --> 00:05:09.579
Don't distract a king when you try to take care of business.

61
00:05:09.579 --> 00:05:11.670
What a narcissist.

62
00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:15.339
But he does have a great body.

63
00:05:15.339 --> 00:05:18.439
Wait, why does he look so familiar from this angle?

64
00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:47.930
Enjoy your seg.

65
00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:48.930
Records for me?

66
00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:51.720
Don't tell me.

67
00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.040
They cheating on you already?

68
00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.040
What?

69
00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.620
No.

70
00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:58.620
I found the man that I was telling you about.

71
00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.620
The one from three years ago.

72
00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:01.620
What's his name?

73
00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:02.620
Ethan.

74
00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.620
Ethan Smith.

75
00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:06.319
Husband.

76
00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:08.540
Ethan.

77
00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:27.259
It's your husband.

78
00:06:27.259 --> 00:06:30.670
An air full time creepo.

79
00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:37.040
Isn't Ethan Smith of this Smith group?

80
00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:42.230
What?

81
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:43.230
Smith group.

82
00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:44.230
CEO.

83
00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:55.079
I think my husband is just a security guard.

84
00:06:55.079 --> 00:06:57.199
All right.

85
00:06:57.199 --> 00:07:01.550
We both know if it weren't for that situation.

86
00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:04.579
You may have been working at the Smith group

87
00:07:04.579 --> 00:07:06.579
and even married to the CEO.

88
00:07:06.579 --> 00:07:07.579
Hi.

89
00:07:07.579 --> 00:07:08.779
I can't complain.

90
00:07:08.779 --> 00:07:09.779
Okay.

91
00:07:09.779 --> 00:07:10.779
I'm happy.

92
00:07:10.779 --> 00:07:12.779
I have a job.

93
00:07:12.779 --> 00:07:14.779
I have a husband.

94
00:07:14.779 --> 00:07:15.779
No.

95
00:07:15.779 --> 00:07:16.779
Apparently.

96
00:07:16.779 --> 00:07:17.779
I don't know.

97
00:07:17.779 --> 00:07:19.779
Maybe even a family in the future.

98
00:07:19.779 --> 00:07:42.569
Stella.

99
00:07:42.569 --> 00:07:43.569
The prostitute.

100
00:07:43.569 --> 00:07:44.569
Give it back.

101
00:07:44.569 --> 00:07:50.370
One of your clients.

102
00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:51.370
Give this to you.

103
00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:53.370
Business must be booming.

104
00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:55.370
Do you remember back in high school?

105
00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:57.370
You were drowning in boys.

106
00:07:58.399 --> 00:07:59.399
Look who it is.

107
00:07:59.399 --> 00:08:00.399
Stella.

108
00:08:00.399 --> 00:08:01.399
The neighborhood whore.

109
00:08:01.399 --> 00:08:02.399
How much for a night?

110
00:08:02.399 --> 00:08:06.879
Actually, I have $200 right here for you.

111
00:08:06.879 --> 00:08:08.879
Maybe you'll throw in a tip if you do a good job.

112
00:08:08.879 --> 00:08:09.879
How's that?

113
00:08:09.879 --> 00:08:10.879
Sounds like a good deal.

114
00:08:10.879 --> 00:08:12.300
Yeah.

115
00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:13.300
Come on.

116
00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:14.300
Don't act so innocent.

117
00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:16.300
We've seen those nasty photos of you on my buddy.

118
00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:17.300
Yeah.

119
00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:18.300
She's a wild one.

120
00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:20.300
How many regulars did you have?

121
00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:21.300
Ten.

122
00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:22.300
Eleven.

123
00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:23.300
Don't talk about me like that.

124
00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:24.300
That wasn't true.

125
00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:25.300
It was all fake photos.

126
00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:26.300
Yeah, sure they were.

127
00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:28.300
Just like this ring.

128
00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:30.300
Probably from some guy you seduced.

129
00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:32.299
That's my wedding ring, please.

130
00:08:32.299 --> 00:08:34.299
You're married?

131
00:08:34.299 --> 00:08:35.299
Who's your husband?

132
00:08:35.299 --> 00:08:37.299
Does he know about your past?

133
00:08:37.299 --> 00:08:38.299
I could tell him for you.

134
00:08:38.299 --> 00:08:40.299
He doesn't need to hear your nonsense.

135
00:08:40.299 --> 00:08:42.299
Now give me back the ring or I'm going to call the cops.

136
00:08:42.299 --> 00:08:43.899
Here.

137
00:08:43.899 --> 00:08:50.950
Take it.

138
00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:58.899
I guess you'll just have to get it yourself.

139
00:08:58.899 --> 00:08:59.899
That's what you got.

140
00:08:59.899 --> 00:09:03.179
You'll pay for this, you bitch.

141
00:09:03.179 --> 00:09:26.549
Thank you.

142
00:09:26.549 --> 00:09:28.159
Have a seat.

143
00:09:28.159 --> 00:09:29.669
Yeah.

144
00:09:29.669 --> 00:09:32.149
What's the plan?

145
00:09:32.149 --> 00:09:33.409
What?

146
00:09:33.409 --> 00:09:34.409
What's the plan?

147
00:09:34.409 --> 00:09:36.409
Well, the baby making plan, of course.

148
00:09:36.409 --> 00:09:37.409
I want all the details.

149
00:09:37.409 --> 00:09:40.409
It's like, how many times do you shake the sheets?

150
00:09:40.409 --> 00:09:42.409
Do you get my drift?

151
00:09:42.409 --> 00:09:47.730
Grandma.

152
00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:49.730
What kind of question is that?

153
00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:51.730
Where did you even learn those words?

154
00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:53.049
Oh, please.

155
00:09:53.049 --> 00:09:54.049
We're all adults here.

156
00:09:54.049 --> 00:09:56.049
And besides, I'm not getting any younger.

157
00:09:56.049 --> 00:09:58.049
And you both promised me kids.

158
00:09:58.049 --> 00:09:59.049
We know.

159
00:09:59.049 --> 00:10:00.049
Grandma.

160
00:10:00.049 --> 00:10:04.620
But having kids isn't something you can exactly rush.

161
00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:05.620
Oh, sure it is.

162
00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:07.620
And I have the solution.

163
00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:15.659
So, this new age shaman, friend of mine.

164
00:10:15.659 --> 00:10:18.659
And he is a miracle worker.

165
00:10:18.659 --> 00:10:23.879
So you take one of these after dinner for two weeks.

166
00:10:23.879 --> 00:10:26.879
And you will have a bundle of joy popping out in no time.

167
00:10:26.879 --> 00:10:36.279
Do we have to take these?

168
00:10:36.279 --> 00:10:38.860
I mean, unless you don't want kids.

169
00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:40.919
No, no, that's not it.

170
00:10:40.919 --> 00:10:47.240
It's just Grandma really wants to have this amazing grandkid.

171
00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:49.240
Yeah, I don't know if these people are going to work.

172
00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:51.620
You've had them before?

173
00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:53.909
I've had people look into this shaman.

174
00:10:53.909 --> 00:10:55.909
I'm pretty sure he's a fraud.

175
00:10:55.909 --> 00:10:59.740
Well, you should tell Grandma she's being scammed.

176
00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:01.740
No, I'm too busy.

177
00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:04.740
Besides, Grandma likes her weekend excursions with her shaman.

178
00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:07.740
I just considered a fee for his companionship.

179
00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:14.730
Do you want kids?

180
00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:31.840
I can be there in just a minute.

181
00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:36.019
It's the bakery.

182
00:11:36.019 --> 00:11:38.019
They're super behind on orders.

183
00:11:38.019 --> 00:11:40.019
And they need me to help them make deliveries.

184
00:11:40.019 --> 00:11:42.019
Oh, okay, I can drive you.

185
00:11:42.019 --> 00:11:43.019
No, it's okay.

186
00:11:43.019 --> 00:11:44.019
It's super close.

187
00:11:44.019 --> 00:11:54.299
I can just walk there.

188
00:11:54.299 --> 00:11:55.299
She's something.

189
00:11:55.299 --> 00:12:32.659
Enjoy your meal.

190
00:12:32.659 --> 00:12:33.659
Go ahead and look in.

191
00:12:33.659 --> 00:12:36.659
I saw you down the hallway and I was wondering if you were open for business

192
00:12:36.659 --> 00:12:40.659
because I could really use those services tonight.

193
00:12:40.659 --> 00:12:42.659
Pervert, I'm delivering pastry.

194
00:12:42.659 --> 00:12:44.659
Oh, delivering sweets, huh?

195
00:12:44.659 --> 00:12:46.659
Aren't you the tasty little treat?

196
00:12:46.659 --> 00:12:48.659
Tell you what, baby, why don't you come over here?

197
00:12:48.659 --> 00:12:56.700
Are you double?

198
00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:59.700
Now, why would you be here this late at night if it wasn't to have a good time?

199
00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:00.700
Hmm?

200
00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:05.700
I'll tell you what, baby, you be mine as you won't ever have to hurt for money ever again.

201
00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:06.700
Stop it!

202
00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:07.860
I told you I have a husband!

203
00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:09.860
Oh, yes, your husband.

204
00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:11.860
That's right, hmm?

205
00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:13.860
I'll tell you what, you take care of me.

206
00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:17.860
And I will absolutely take care of you, huh?

207
00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:25.460
Oh, just scream my name, baby.

208
00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:28.460
It's gonna be the only one you'll need to remember after tonight.

209
00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:31.460
Unlike that loser of a husband you have.

210
00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:34.460
I bet he can't even finish the job in bed, can he?

211
00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:37.679
Out of your mouth!

212
00:13:37.679 --> 00:13:41.679
You actually love the guy, huh?

213
00:13:41.679 --> 00:13:42.679
Good!

214
00:13:42.679 --> 00:13:45.679
It's gonna make this whole thing so much more thrilling.

215
00:13:45.679 --> 00:13:48.679
And how about you and me make him a little homemade video?

216
00:13:48.679 --> 00:13:50.679
Just the two of us.

217
00:13:50.679 --> 00:13:51.679
Defend it to him.

218
00:13:51.679 --> 00:13:54.679
I'm sure the son of a bitch can learn a thing or two.

219
00:13:54.679 --> 00:13:55.679
Got it!

220
00:13:55.679 --> 00:14:03.509
Bitch, where do you think no one's coming for you?

221
00:14:03.509 --> 00:14:05.509
You are all mine.

222
00:14:05.509 --> 00:14:25.169
You can't do this to me.

223
00:14:25.169 --> 00:14:26.169
Miller, huh?

224
00:14:26.169 --> 00:14:28.169
All I need is to make one phone call,

225
00:14:28.169 --> 00:14:31.190
and I'll end your entire family.

226
00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:33.190
And my family?

227
00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:34.190
You go ahead and try.

228
00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:37.190
We're not gonna be intimidated by some security card.

229
00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:45.690
What do you mean family accounts are bankrupt?

230
00:14:45.690 --> 00:15:04.779
Don't worry about that cycle anymore.

231
00:15:04.779 --> 00:15:09.909
You know what he said to me?

232
00:15:09.909 --> 00:15:11.909
That you couldn't get the job done in bed.

233
00:15:11.909 --> 00:15:31.870
And I got so bad then.

234
00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:33.639
You're too drunk.

235
00:15:33.639 --> 00:15:36.090
I'm gonna go make you a hot cup of tea or something.

236
00:15:36.090 --> 00:15:52.710
Everything about you is so beautiful.

237
00:15:52.710 --> 00:16:20.299
It's really merry.

238
00:16:20.299 --> 00:16:37.080
Like who?

239
00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:47.210
Is it an ex-boyfriend or something?

240
00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:49.679
No.

241
00:16:49.679 --> 00:16:51.679
Don't avoid the question.

242
00:16:51.679 --> 00:16:52.679
Tell me.

243
00:16:52.679 --> 00:16:54.190
Kiss me.

244
00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:56.539
You're such a child.

245
00:16:56.539 --> 00:16:58.539
Go be with him if that's what you want to do.

246
00:16:58.539 --> 00:17:04.920
I don't play games this bro.

247
00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:05.920
So bro...

248
00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:12.619
My psychiatrist likes to think so.

249
00:17:12.619 --> 00:17:19.460
You were having such a good night.

250
00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:21.460
Things started to ramp up,

251
00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:23.460
and then he just throws me in the pool.

252
00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:25.289
Guys haven't.

253
00:17:25.289 --> 00:17:26.289
No.

254
00:17:26.289 --> 00:17:29.349
We've been married for days and nothing.

255
00:17:29.349 --> 00:17:31.349
It's like he doesn't even want to touch me

256
00:17:31.349 --> 00:17:35.819
and we're sleeping in separate rooms.

257
00:17:35.819 --> 00:17:39.880
Are you sure he doesn't...

258
00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:44.000
playing for the other team?

259
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000
No, trust me, Pinocchio is ready to tell a lie.

260
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:52.160
I got it.

261
00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:54.539
Maybe it's his ex-wife.

262
00:17:54.539 --> 00:17:56.539
He's probably still hung up on her.

263
00:17:56.539 --> 00:17:57.539
That's gotta be it.

264
00:17:57.539 --> 00:18:06.089
Well, if he still loves her then why would he divorce her in the first place?

265
00:18:06.089 --> 00:18:08.119
Maybe she left him.

266
00:18:08.119 --> 00:18:09.119
You never know.

267
00:18:09.119 --> 00:18:11.119
You should be careful with this guy.

268
00:18:11.119 --> 00:18:12.119
No.

269
00:18:12.119 --> 00:18:14.470
No, he's not like that.

270
00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:18.049
Truly, I mean, I'll go down the list, okay?

271
00:18:18.049 --> 00:18:20.049
One, he is a gentleman.

272
00:18:20.049 --> 00:18:23.049
Two, he's generous.

273
00:18:23.049 --> 00:18:25.589
Three, brave.

274
00:18:25.589 --> 00:18:31.700
Four, he's strong.

275
00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:35.369
Five, he's always there for me.

276
00:18:35.369 --> 00:18:36.369
Whenever I need him.

277
00:18:36.369 --> 00:18:45.180
It's where he's like.

278
00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:46.180
What?

279
00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:47.180
Why are you smiling?

280
00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:49.180
You fell for him pretty hard, didn't you?

281
00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:52.470
I don't know what you're talking about.

282
00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:55.569
Look, if you're really into this guy,

283
00:18:55.569 --> 00:18:59.910
just seal the deal tonight.

284
00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:55.380
Are you doing sneaking into my room in the middle of the night?

285
00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:59.819
Well, think it should be our rep.

286
00:19:59.819 --> 00:20:03.900
I don't want to sleep in separate pimps anymore.

287
00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:10.420
You want to sleep in bed with me?

288
00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:35.319
I've been lost by it, right?

289
00:20:35.319 --> 00:20:49.920
Sick.

290
00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:54.380
Sick?

291
00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:56.980
First she's all hot and bothered about her.

292
00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:59.980
Now she thinks kissing me is disgusting?

293
00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:01.299
Yes.

294
00:21:01.299 --> 00:21:04.299
I've never felt more disgusted in my life.

295
00:21:04.299 --> 00:21:05.299
Get out.

296
00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:09.960
I'm sorry, what?

297
00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:10.960
Get out.

298
00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:11.960
Or I will.

299
00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:27.779
He's right.

300
00:21:27.779 --> 00:21:34.930
He still in love with his ex-wife.

301
00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:35.930
What am I going to do?

302
00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:49.740
Toss his ex, the glue.

303
00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:51.740
Waitress, I got pachino, please?

304
00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:56.269
That'll be $6.

305
00:21:56.269 --> 00:21:57.369
Ew.

306
00:21:57.369 --> 00:21:59.369
Well, well, if it isn't Stella.

307
00:21:59.369 --> 00:22:01.779
No, I heard you were waiting tables.

308
00:22:01.779 --> 00:22:03.779
I had to come see it for myself.

309
00:22:03.779 --> 00:22:06.069
You're so pathetic.

310
00:22:06.069 --> 00:22:08.069
Just looking at you makes me nauseous.

311
00:22:08.069 --> 00:22:10.069
I earned my money the honest way.

312
00:22:10.069 --> 00:22:11.069
There's nothing pathetic.

313
00:22:11.069 --> 00:22:13.069
We're just graceful about what I do.

314
00:22:13.069 --> 00:22:15.420
$6.

315
00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:34.740
Charging people for that shit.

316
00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:40.480
That tasted like this.

317
00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:43.119
You should try our premium grade.

318
00:22:43.119 --> 00:22:45.119
It's really our most popular batch.

319
00:22:45.119 --> 00:22:46.119
You want to see?

320
00:22:46.119 --> 00:22:50.460
I'm nervous lady here has just decided to treat you all

321
00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:53.460
to our most expensive pan and legatia coffee.

322
00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:56.460
Let's give her a round of applause.

323
00:22:56.460 --> 00:23:05.650
Generous.

324
00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:07.650
You're so incredibly beautiful too.

325
00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:09.650
I've never met anybody like you.

326
00:23:09.650 --> 00:23:11.650
Thank you so much.

327
00:23:11.650 --> 00:23:13.740
What can I say?

328
00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:14.740
I'm feeling generous.

329
00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:19.019
So generous in fact that I would like to add

330
00:23:19.019 --> 00:23:22.019
an additional bag of your finest coffee beans.

331
00:23:22.019 --> 00:23:25.690
Well, get to it bitch.

332
00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:33.349
Alright, you're excellent.

333
00:23:33.349 --> 00:23:35.609
That'll be $8,000.

334
00:23:35.609 --> 00:23:36.609
Come again.

335
00:23:36.609 --> 00:23:37.609
You heard me.

336
00:23:37.609 --> 00:23:40.019
I'm sure that's chum changed for you.

337
00:23:40.019 --> 00:23:43.019
With all your expensive cars and fancy homes.

338
00:23:43.019 --> 00:23:45.859
Just charge it.

339
00:23:45.859 --> 00:23:51.730
Thank you for your business.

340
00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:54.730
And thank you so much especially for that tip.

341
00:23:54.730 --> 00:23:56.759
I really appreciate it.

342
00:23:56.759 --> 00:23:59.460
You'll pay for this bitch.

343
00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:11.160
50 grand in it for you.

344
00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:15.019
You won't hurt anyone right?

345
00:24:15.019 --> 00:24:18.019
It'll itch a bit so don't drink it.

346
00:24:18.019 --> 00:24:21.019
But make sure Stella is the one who makes the coffee.

347
00:24:21.019 --> 00:24:29.960
Why am I jealous?

348
00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:30.960
She's my wife.

349
00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:34.339
I should be feeling happy not feeling shitty.

350
00:24:34.339 --> 00:24:36.339
Sir, as requested we've purchased

351
00:24:36.339 --> 00:24:38.339
the bakery where Mrs. Smith works.

352
00:24:38.339 --> 00:24:43.119
Good job.

353
00:24:43.119 --> 00:24:45.460
Wait, sir.

354
00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:46.460
Where are you going?

355
00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:47.980
You make things right.

356
00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:54.859
Why am I so itchy?

357
00:24:54.859 --> 00:24:55.859
Me too.

358
00:24:55.859 --> 00:24:56.859
Is there something wrong with the coffee?

359
00:24:56.859 --> 00:24:58.859
It tastes funny.

360
00:24:58.859 --> 00:25:01.500
This coffee is making us itch.

361
00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:02.500
What the hell is this?

362
00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:03.569
What's in it?

363
00:25:03.569 --> 00:25:12.119
It's perfectly fine.

364
00:25:12.119 --> 00:25:13.119
What do you think I'm just making up?

365
00:25:13.119 --> 00:25:15.119
I wasn't itching before I drank the coffee.

366
00:25:15.119 --> 00:25:16.119
Exactly.

367
00:25:16.119 --> 00:25:17.119
I mean, look at my skin.

368
00:25:17.119 --> 00:25:21.819
Do you know how much I business in the hospital is?

369
00:25:21.819 --> 00:25:22.819
You're finished, bitch.

370
00:25:22.819 --> 00:25:24.819
I'm terribly sorry for the inconvenience.

371
00:25:24.819 --> 00:25:27.819
We'll be taking care of things for everyone.

372
00:25:27.819 --> 00:25:31.539
This will be taken out of your paycheck.

373
00:25:31.539 --> 00:25:33.539
Your negligence won't be tolerated, Stella.

374
00:25:33.539 --> 00:25:35.539
I did everything like I normally do.

375
00:25:35.539 --> 00:25:36.539
This is a huge misunderstanding.

376
00:25:36.539 --> 00:25:37.539
I'm misunderstanding.

377
00:25:37.539 --> 00:25:40.539
As the barista, you're in charge of ensuring that

378
00:25:40.539 --> 00:25:44.539
every cup of Joe is up to quality standards.

379
00:25:44.539 --> 00:25:47.539
If there's a problem, you're the one to blame.

380
00:25:47.539 --> 00:25:49.539
Learn from your mistakes.

381
00:25:49.539 --> 00:25:51.539
Don't make excuses.

382
00:25:51.539 --> 00:25:53.539
I did nothing wrong.

383
00:25:53.539 --> 00:25:55.660
France footage.

384
00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:56.660
No need.

385
00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:58.660
This was clearly your fault.

386
00:25:58.660 --> 00:25:59.660
Now get out of here.

387
00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:00.660
You're fired.

388
00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:03.230
You step back.

389
00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:05.779
It's my wife you're talking to.

390
00:26:05.779 --> 00:26:09.150
What are you doing here?

391
00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:12.269
I won't anybody believe.

392
00:26:12.269 --> 00:26:13.269
What's this?

393
00:26:13.269 --> 00:26:16.200
She's married to my ex-husband.

394
00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:20.450
And he's treating her nice.

395
00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:23.309
He never treated me like that.

396
00:26:23.309 --> 00:26:30.339
You think you are interfering in my affairs.

397
00:26:30.339 --> 00:26:33.789
As of today, I'm the donor of the store.

398
00:26:33.789 --> 00:26:36.140
Which means my wife is too.

399
00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:37.779
And you?

400
00:26:37.779 --> 00:26:38.779
You're fired.

401
00:26:38.779 --> 00:26:39.910
Her?

402
00:26:39.910 --> 00:26:40.910
The shop owner?

403
00:26:40.910 --> 00:26:42.329
That's impossible.

404
00:26:42.329 --> 00:26:44.329
Why don't you check it yourself?

405
00:26:44.329 --> 00:26:53.910
That woman that made me do it.

406
00:26:53.910 --> 00:26:59.079
Places all yours.

407
00:26:59.079 --> 00:27:00.079
Congratulations.

408
00:27:00.079 --> 00:27:01.079
Boss.

409
00:27:01.079 --> 00:27:06.049
This is not cheap.

410
00:27:06.049 --> 00:27:08.049
How did you get this money?

411
00:27:08.049 --> 00:27:09.049
Oh.

412
00:27:09.049 --> 00:27:10.049
Hi.
