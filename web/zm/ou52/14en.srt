1
00:00:06,059 --> 00:00:09,060
I can't believe I'm the owner of my own bakery.

2
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:13,910
I was really coming up.

3
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:16,420
Someone better pinch me.

4
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:35,700
I'm a taller tip.

5
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:41,509
Okay, I'm going to start with this right away.

6
00:00:41,509 --> 00:00:44,609
Make it extra special.

7
00:00:44,609 --> 00:00:50,810
If I hadn't been expelled, maybe I could have worked here.

8
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:54,100
I've heard their CEO is super talented.

9
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:57,420
Let's see what this other Ethan looks like.

10
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,469
What a pleasant surprise.

11
00:00:59,469 --> 00:01:01,469
I was unexpected for another week.

12
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:02,469
Wow, we heard from your grandmother.

13
00:01:02,469 --> 00:01:03,469
You got married.

14
00:01:03,469 --> 00:01:05,469
How could we keep vacationing?

15
00:01:05,469 --> 00:01:08,469
Meeting our daughter-in-law, you know, that takes priority.

16
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:10,469
Well, rest for a couple days.

17
00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:12,469
I'll arrange a meeting for you and meet my wife.

18
00:01:12,469 --> 00:01:14,469
I promise you're going to love her.

19
00:01:14,469 --> 00:01:16,469
Well, all that matters is that you love her.

20
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:17,469
True love.

21
00:01:17,469 --> 00:01:19,469
Right, sweetheart, just like you and me.

22
00:01:19,469 --> 00:01:20,469
Wow, Dad, okay.

23
00:01:20,469 --> 00:01:22,469
Really reaching for those brownie points, aren't you?

24
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:23,469
Don't worry, son.

25
00:01:23,469 --> 00:01:25,469
You'll be there soon enough.

26
00:01:25,469 --> 00:01:28,579
Come in.
