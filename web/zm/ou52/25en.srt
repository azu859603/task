1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:01,710
What?

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:17,500
I've got some interest in it.

3
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,339
We'll keep digging.

4
00:00:18,339 --> 00:00:23,039
I want to know everything.

5
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:24,280
What's wrong?

6
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,980
Oh, nothing.

7
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,379
Oh, I noticed you got a lot of items in your current.

8
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:33,049
You making my parents' favorite pumpkin squash ravioli?

9
00:00:33,049 --> 00:00:42,170
Make sure you give yourself something, too.

10
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:43,450
Stake is amazing.

11
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:47,170
It's so tender and flavorful.

12
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:52,920
My mom, she used to make it for me.

13
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:59,329
Oh, that's expensive.

14
00:00:59,329 --> 00:01:01,820
I'm going to go look for something else.

15
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:20,370
Hop in the jet, go to Okinawa,

16
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:26,060
and get some of that Uzu Koshu Wagyu piranto.

17
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,260
Man, load that sucker to capacity.
