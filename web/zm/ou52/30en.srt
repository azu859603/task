1
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:03,839
Are you okay? Just breathe.

2
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:21,730
I'm so sorry, Ethan. I'm meant to hit him up.

3
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:25,730
I told you time and time and again not hurt Stella. You don't listen.

4
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:33,729
Please, you're choking me. Stella, Stella.

5
00:00:33,729 --> 00:00:35,729
You can stop us not worth it.

6
00:00:36,729 --> 00:00:41,840
Get out of here. I don't want to see you again.

7
00:00:41,840 --> 00:01:01,390
Is that what Darcy says you have a remote enclosure?

8
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:08,180
You need to rest. Please don't do it stupid like that again.

9
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:14,969
The thought of losing you, I can't live without you. I love you.

10
00:01:14,969 --> 00:01:17,129
You love me?

11
00:01:18,129 --> 00:01:25,140
I know why marriage was really fast, but...

12
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,140
I think I've fallen in love with you.

13
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:32,079
I love you too.

14
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:40,540
For all I...

15
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,540
Did we pay the electric bill?

16
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:48,439
Nothing's more important than this right now.

17
00:01:48,439 --> 00:02:03,739
You're out wide though. We Stella, Stella, Stella. I'm everything she's not.

18
00:02:03,739 --> 00:02:05,739
I'm prettier. I'm taller. I'm smarter.

19
00:02:05,739 --> 00:02:07,739
You're useless.

20
00:02:07,739 --> 00:02:09,740
Dad, how can you say that?

21
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:14,740
It's your financial decisions that are getting us into debt, and now I'm an accessory to fraud and embezzlement.

22
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:19,219
As if you didn't enjoy spitting our money, it's too late now.

23
00:02:19,219 --> 00:02:24,860
The Smith Group is going to come out as just everything they got. We're done for. Unless we got quick.

24
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:31,969
I can't get Ethan back, but what if Stella leaves Ethan?

25
00:02:31,969 --> 00:02:36,969
That's the stupidest idea I've ever heard. Who in the right mind would leave a billionaire?

26
00:02:36,969 --> 00:02:40,969
That's preposterous, childish, idiotic!

27
00:02:40,969 --> 00:02:48,129
Naive? And who's Naive?

28
00:02:48,129 --> 00:03:20,120
Time we show Stella who her husband really is.

29
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,120
I'm hanging up now.

30
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,120
I found him. The guy from the end.

31
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:31,319
Who?

32
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:35,319
The company's annual gal is in three days, and Stella is to accompany me.

33
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:38,319
But here's my dilemma. She has no idea who I am.

34
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,319
And I fear what may happen if she finds out.

35
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:49,460
But this charades.

36
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:52,460
She's a smart girl, and she's going to find out soon enough.

37
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:55,460
So don't let it get to that.

38
00:03:55,460 --> 00:04:25,050
Ethan, my Ethan, a humble security guard is the CEO of this Smith company.

39
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:31,000
What are you scheming? Smells like bullshit.

40
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,670
Here, take a look at this.

41
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:39,569
Look familiar? Oh, what humble beginnings?

42
00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:45,589
I bet you're his new plaything. Just wait till he gets tired of you like he got tired of me.

43
00:04:45,589 --> 00:04:49,589
It's none of your business. You don't know anything about my husband.

44
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:53,589
What if I told you he already tossed you aside three years ago?

45
00:04:53,589 --> 00:04:59,540
Put the pieces together, Stella.

46
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:04,759
That man who ruined your life? Who spread all those rumors about you?

47
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:09,360
No. No, that's not possible.

48
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,740
He wasn't at the hotel. His name wasn't on the list.

49
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:15,740
Do you really think a CEO would put his name on the list?

50
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:19,060
No. He has an assistant for that.

51
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:21,639
You know John.

52
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:25,220
John Will. Ethan's assistant.

53
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:47,819
Hey, I need you to cross-reference my name for me from three years ago.

54
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:51,579
John Will.

55
00:05:51,579 --> 00:05:53,579
Okay, one sec. I'm checking.

56
00:05:53,579 --> 00:05:56,529
Yeah.

57
00:05:56,529 --> 00:06:13,660
Well, they require photo ideas at check-in right now.

58
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:20,399
Ethan Smith. Stella.

59
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:41,860
This is Tim.

60
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:42,860
No one can.

61
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:49,470
I'm sorry. Please forgive me. I'm sorry.

62
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:53,500
Please forgive me. I love sincerity.

63
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,139
Come on, man.

64
00:06:56,139 --> 00:07:04,319
The light of my life. The spark that gives me purpose.

65
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,319
The world would be nothing without you in it.

66
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:11,990
From the bottom of my heart, I apologize.

67
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:14,600
Please forgive me.

68
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,600
Say you admit it.

69
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,040
What are you? What are you crying?

70
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,040
I know everything.

71
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,490
Shit, I'm sorry. I was going to tell you.

72
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:25,490
What else is a lie?

73
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:27,740
This rented house.

74
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:30,740
Your feelings? Your fake identity?

75
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:38,639
And your family? You brought your family in on all of your lives?

76
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:39,639
Do you think I'm that gullible?

77
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:43,639
No, I'm sorry. It's just my first marriage failed, so I just assumed you were...

78
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:44,639
Oh, God.

79
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:54,410
I can understand that.

80
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:56,079
Really?

81
00:07:56,079 --> 00:08:10,389
Ruined your life?

82
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:15,139
I want a divorce.

83
00:08:15,139 --> 00:08:16,139
What?

84
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:23,399
Let it out. You're defoisting my tears.

85
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:27,779
For who? For a liar who ruined my life?

86
00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:31,449
The nerve of this man.

87
00:08:31,449 --> 00:08:33,450
Playing with your feelings like this?

88
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:40,809
If I had known that I was him, then none of this would have ever happened.

89
00:08:40,809 --> 00:08:45,299
And no one just hurts.

90
00:08:45,299 --> 00:08:46,620
Bonjour!

91
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:49,620
Ever dream of being a world famous pastry chef?

92
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,879
Study in putty.

93
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:54,299
Find yourself.

94
00:08:54,299 --> 00:08:56,299
Shake your future.

95
00:08:56,299 --> 00:08:57,740
Call now.

96
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:06,850
Ruined your life?

97
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:09,009
Did I hurt you that much?

98
00:09:09,009 --> 00:09:13,149
Pearl, I'm...

99
00:09:13,149 --> 00:09:17,169
Mrs. Smith.

100
00:09:17,169 --> 00:09:21,360
I mean, Stella just closed down the bakery.

101
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,360
Apparently she's going to France to study, and she signed us right before leaving.

102
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:31,340
There's something else.

103
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:34,620
We recovered the rest of the footage from that night.

104
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:38,620
How it plays out is you heavily inebriated.

105
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,620
Go into Stella's room.

106
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:44,620
Ruby then enters the next morning, right before you wake up.

107
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,620
So Stella's the one that hooked up with that night?

108
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,620
There's more.

109
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:53,620
The video shows Ruby bribing the staff to spread false information about Stella's promiscuity.

110
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:56,620
That's why she thinks you're behind it.

111
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,620
So that's why she said her...

112
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:04,139
I only left Ethan.

113
00:10:04,139 --> 00:10:05,139
To miracles.

114
00:10:05,139 --> 00:10:06,139
To miracles?

115
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:09,139
These are back on track with what he'd never do.

116
00:10:09,139 --> 00:10:10,139
Don't mess it up.

117
00:10:10,139 --> 00:10:12,139
Not in a million years.

118
00:10:12,139 --> 00:10:14,649
Ethan!

119
00:10:14,649 --> 00:10:17,649
For three years, you've been posing as Stella and even duped me into a marriage.

120
00:10:17,649 --> 00:10:19,649
That's not even the worst of it.

121
00:10:19,649 --> 00:10:24,649
You fabricated lies, smeared her reputation, gutted her life and left her with nothing.

122
00:10:24,649 --> 00:10:28,220
Not anymore.

123
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:32,309
It's clear now, and on camera, courts are going to love you.

124
00:10:32,309 --> 00:10:41,580
Ethan, we got off on the wrong foot.

125
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,580
Stella or Ruby, either way you see.

126
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:46,580
I'm still your father-in-law, you're still my son-in-law.

127
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,580
Stella made back to different, so do I.

128
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:54,580
He felt a realizeness or four that cutting ties with your daughter means that you and I are no longer related.

129
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:57,580
And a few hours, all four assets will cease to exist.

130
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:00,580
Every last fucking one of them.

131
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:01,580
You'll have nothing.

132
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:02,580
No.

133
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,580
I know I lied to you, but I still love you.

134
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,580
You make me sick.

135
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:07,580
And a few minutes the authorities will be here.

136
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:09,580
Do it freedom you have left.

137
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:55,529
Three years ago, I impersonated my step-sister, Stella Ford, and concocted a one-night stand with the Smith Group CEO, Ethan Smith.

138
00:11:55,529 --> 00:12:04,230
I continued to slander her name and reputation through fake social media accounts, fictitious videos and testimonies.

139
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:11,490
Doing so led to her immediate exit from educational institutions and future job opportunities.

140
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:17,519
I sincerely apologize and seek forgiveness from all associated parties.

141
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,669
I was wrong about Ethan.

142
00:12:20,669 --> 00:12:41,539
Go to grandma.

143
00:12:41,539 --> 00:13:02,870
Come home ASAP.

144
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:04,870
I got a big surprise for you.

145
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:15,299
It's not good to go to bed without a bite to eat, bro.

146
00:13:15,299 --> 00:13:20,370
I like dreaming.

147
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:23,830
You know.

148
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:25,500
Why?

149
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,340
What do you think?

150
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:33,139
How did you get in?

151
00:13:33,139 --> 00:13:39,019
Wait, you're my big surprise.

152
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:41,080
I made your favorite.

153
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,080
I even cut it too.

154
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:47,360
Don't think that cooking me a steak will make me forgive you.

155
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,360
You still lied to me, Mr. CEO.

156
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:54,470
I know what to do is wrong.

157
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,570
I've been beating myself up about it ever since.

158
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:58,570
I told that lie from the first place.

159
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:02,269
If I can go back to the beginning, I would.

160
00:14:02,269 --> 00:14:05,100
I'm not asking for forgiveness.

161
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:08,330
I'm just asking for a second chance to earn a trust.

162
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:13,429
I take it back.

163
00:14:13,429 --> 00:14:18,429
Maybe cooking me a steak every day for the rest of my life will make me forgive you.

164
00:14:18,429 --> 00:14:20,879
Anything from my parole.

165
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:29,990
You know what make this steak taste even better?

166
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:30,990
Sharing it with you.

167
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:34,659
Is that so?

168
00:14:34,659 --> 00:14:35,659
Taste your flavor.

169
00:14:35,659 --> 00:14:36,659
Taste your lips.

170
00:14:36,659 --> 00:14:38,720
I'll be the judge of that.

171
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:50,059
Please, I misjudged you.

172
00:14:50,059 --> 00:14:52,350
I missed you so much.

173
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,450
I missed you too, girl.

174
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:56,539
I'm not okay.

175
00:14:56,539 --> 00:15:26,340
It looks, please.

176
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:29,409
Everyone, enjoy yourselves. Everything is half off.

177
00:15:29,409 --> 00:15:40,759
Thank you so much for helping me with all these renovations.

I did some stuff here and there, but it was your money that did the work.

179
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:55,659
Congratulations, parole. I'm so proud of you.

180
00:15:55,659 --> 00:15:57,820
It's adorable.

181
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:03,100
You know, I can start saving for an ex-expansion.

182
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:06,100
I actually have a gift for you, too.

183
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,100
Oh, yeah?

184
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,100
Mm-hmm.

185
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:15,120
Wait, you?

186
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:29,990
I could have never imagined this moment.

187
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:38,360
My life being so complete, so loved that a future could be possible.
