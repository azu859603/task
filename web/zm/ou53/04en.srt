1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'll marry you.

2
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:13,400
I can't stand a kind girl like that being bully bottles of assholes plus if I marry her

3
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:19,219
I won't have to deal with nagging to get married again. He actually stands up for me when I meet it at the most

4
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:22,550
Okay, let's get married

5
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:32,079
Yeah, that's the couple straight out of heaven

6
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,159
That's only for now

7
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:36,159
Soon enough, I'll make him the richest man in the morning

8
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:43,960
Lord, I'm already the richest man in the south. What's the point making a hub of richer than the Mr. Baratheon?

9
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:46,799
Getting dumped definitely drove you insane

10
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,659
But yeah

11
00:01:03,659 --> 00:01:07,000
As soon as I get that $2 billion from the Baratheon project

12
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:09,760
I'll free some money. We use it for therapy

13
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,959
So I'm sure once we come back to sanity

14
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:15,000
You're gonna realize how tragic it is that you married a hobo to get back

15
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:18,659
Why are you still offering me pity money?

16
00:01:18,939 --> 00:01:23,200
You know, I set up that bid to get you the project. You can say goodbye to that now

17
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:30,010
You should really be careful. I lie like that could snowball into a disaster

18
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:36,870
I wasn't burning. She's still trying to take credit. It was me who pulled the strings from a series

19
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:40,189
The bid is only for show strings, huh?

20
00:01:40,189 --> 00:01:44,709
I bet they're not strong enough to overpower my company the stark group

21
00:01:44,709 --> 00:01:49,879
You mean the stark family who owns most of the real estate in the south?

22
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,680
That's the one breathing in the real world more like king of cuckoo land

23
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:04,359
Your lives are gonna snowball into disaster. It's not a lie. I really do own the star group

24
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:13,460
Okay, you a delivery girl and you a hobo do low-life stage reading out loud over there

25
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,060
Let's go series

26
00:02:16,699 --> 00:02:34,780
Insanity tea my lady. Oh what the series have the project. Why did he betray you?

27
00:02:34,939 --> 00:02:40,300
Don't worry. There are plenty fish in the sea. We'll make sure that you have your pick
