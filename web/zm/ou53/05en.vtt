00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.500
I will make sure that you have your pick.

2
00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.299
I just... I gotta say help.

3
00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.580
You know, you are a really good actress.

4
00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.580
I mean, down to every detail.

5
00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.710
Just know this.

6
00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.710
You don't have to act in front of me.

7
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:20.710
I wasn't.

8
00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:26.420
You wouldn't believe me anyway.

9
00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.420
Hey, um, you're probably hungry since that dog took your food.

10
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.420
Oh.

11
00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.420
Would you wanna get some to eat?

12
00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:35.420
My treat.

13
00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.810
I shouldn't hurt her ego, especially right after such a drastic change in her life.

14
00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.810
But I should probably pay for dinner since she's broke.

15
00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.969
Can't let the lady pay.

16
00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:47.969
My treat.

17
00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.320
He's totally broke but still trying to be a gentleman.

18
00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.320
But I'll protect his ego as a man.

19
00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.020
How about we go back to my place?

20
00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.020
We can make something cozy.

21
00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.100
Simple.

22
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.930
Sounds like a plan.

23
00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:28.590
Where's the light in this place?

24
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.950
I have magic.

25
00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.769
Hm.

26
00:01:37.769 --> 00:01:43.819
You can just say you have sensor lights, Oscar winner.

27
00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:46.069
Where'd you get this stuff?

28
00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:47.069
Flea market?

29
00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:50.959
You know nothing, Jamie.

30
00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:57.310
Right, right, right, it's free.

31
00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.709
I got these custom made.

32
00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:03.810
You can't get them anywhere else in the world.

33
00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.900
Making lemonade out of life's lemons.

34
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:07.900
Hats off to you.

35
00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.659
Tyrion style.

36
00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:12.659
Rugged and elegant.

37
00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:15.889
I had a custom made by professional interior designer.

38
00:02:15.889 --> 00:02:16.889
Looking good, right?

39
00:02:16.889 --> 00:02:20.889
Is she telling me that this mess is Tyrion style?

40
00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:36.340
She should be glad she's not really living in Syria.

41
00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.509
Here.

42
00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:40.610
Go ahead.

43
00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:41.610
Clean yourself up.

44
00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:58.650
Bathroom's in there.

45
00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.650
Eating homeless makes a man fit.
