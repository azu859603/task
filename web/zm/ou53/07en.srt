1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,270
Oh, we, three years ago.

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:17,949
I have an emergency. I'll be late.

3
00:00:17,949 --> 00:00:19,949
Boss, we missed the flight.

4
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:21,949
But your helicopter is waiting.

5
00:00:21,949 --> 00:00:33,320
No rush. I have to make sure she's fine.

6
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,320
Where's the girl?

7
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,320
The nurse said her family picked her up.

8
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,939
She disappeared after that.

9
00:00:40,939 --> 00:00:44,009
Turns out she thought the serie saved her?

10
00:00:44,009 --> 00:00:48,009
Well, now that we're married, she shouldn't know the truth.

11
00:00:48,009 --> 00:00:51,549
What kind of tune is it, Tyrion? Gives me.

12
00:00:51,549 --> 00:00:55,609
God, she needs turning into a mushroom.

13
00:00:55,609 --> 00:01:00,929
Actually, about that, you should probably know...

14
00:01:00,929 --> 00:01:10,099
So much so.

15
00:01:10,099 --> 00:01:15,700
My man, Deathly, you sent him wrong troubles.

16
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:42,719
When I heard you, let me show.

17
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:44,719
Don't know, can't talk, let me just show you.

18
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:46,719
Don't be obsessive, it could be intensive.

19
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:48,719
It could be expensive, it could be offensive.

20
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:50,719
Don't be defensive, don't be aggressive.

21
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:52,719
It will be a waste case. We could be expensive.

22
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:54,719
In a little thing in your life.

23
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:59,090
Want to see the senior rose?

24
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:01,090
In a little bit of free.
