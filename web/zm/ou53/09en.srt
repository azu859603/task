1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,040
If you're the organizer, then I'm the owner of this hotel.

2
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:08,080
Brian, the Stark family owns this hotel.

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:13,279
Stop embarrassing yourself, or you'll be a disgrace in both the North and the South.

4
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:18,480
If you want to come in, at least dress nicer.

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,039
Did you dive into a dumpster for that dress?

6
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:25,280
Look at you. You've got nothing on Marjorie.

7
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,640
It's a good thing that this race dumped you.

8
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,519
Otherwise, I would be embarrassed if you had this meeting.

9
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:56,109
Get you in for all time's sake, but your clothes are pretty trashy.

10
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,149
I can let you in if you take them off.

11
00:01:00,189 --> 00:01:06,049
Oh, dear. I'm so considerate. What are you waiting for?

12
00:01:06,769 --> 00:01:09,760
Hurry. Take this bitch's clothes off.

13
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,359
The spark is about to be here. It was one of them.

14
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:15,920
What are you afraid of? This is the North.

15
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,799
Mr. Vissery is favored by the most powerful family.

16
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,840
And I think Mr. Baratheon, he would he would back this up.

17
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,400
And besides Mr. Baratheon and Mr. Stark are both men.

18
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,000
What man doesn't like a nice homey strip show?

19
00:01:32,349 --> 00:01:34,670
No. Not on my watch.
