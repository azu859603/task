00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.690
Before you talking to these hobo's?

2
00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:04.589
Shut up, do you know what this is?

3
00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:06.990
Yeah, it's a ring, and it's ugly.

4
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.650
This is Starks' bummer's token.

5
00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.550
The Starks never showed their faces in public.

6
00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:14.849
This token represents her.

7
00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.350
What are you kidding me?

8
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.850
She's nothing more than a delivery girl.

9
00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:21.210
It's hard to get that.

10
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.210
I gave it to her.

11
00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.280
Mr. Stark.

12
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.780
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:28.780
Please forgive me.

14
00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:29.780
It's okay.

15
00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:36.750
However, you on the other hand, I'll make sure you're punished for your snobbery.

16
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:37.750
Damn it.

17
00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:38.750
Oh, you tramps?

18
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.750
I'm sure you picked up a fake.

19
00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.950
This pattern has to be with the Starks, based on what these four generations.

20
00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.950
You can't find anywhere else.

21
00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:56.490
It's the way to ring.

22
00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:57.549
Be careful.

23
00:00:57.549 --> 00:01:01.000
Don't lose it.

24
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000
No way.

25
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I'm sure it's a fake.

26
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I'm not trying for us.

27
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I'm Mr. Stark.

28
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000
I'm the owner of our hotel.

29
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Get out of here.

30
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Get out.

31
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.040
Ow.

32
00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:16.859
Let's go.

33
00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:30.090
What if he asked me about last night?

34
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.090
Should I give him money as compensation?

35
00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.090
What did normal people do in this situation?

36
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.700
You're blushing.

37
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:37.700
Are you shy?

38
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:38.799
No.

39
00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:40.799
No, don't do things like that.

40
00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.659
So, about last night.

41
00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:45.659
I take full responsibility for what happened.

42
00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.659
I can pay you back for the rental car, the suit, the replica ring.

43
00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:50.659
I'm here.

44
00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:53.659
Would two grand be enough?

45
00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.450
I don't want your money.

46
00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.200
What do you want then?

47
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.200
Fame status?

48
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.200
I'll give you all that.

49
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.200
I don't want any back.

50
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:14.159
I want you to be my wife.

51
00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:38.349
You got Mr. Baratheon specifically told everyone to take care of and promote Visarius.

52
00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:44.699
Seeing him today, it is very clear that he is top tier talent.

53
00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:46.500
Indeed.

54
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.500
Mr. Baratheon is one of the top figures in the whole empire.

55
00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.500
Only ready the Southern Stark family comes close.

56
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.500
With Mr. Baratheon's support will be long.

57
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.500
If all the Sarris becomes a leading figure amongst the generation.

58
00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.500
Mr. Starko.

59
00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.500
Oh, Ms. Sarris.

60
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.500
When you meet Mr. Baratheon, please.

61
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.560
Put in a good word for me.

62
00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:07.560
How can I not?

63
00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.560
We make two good of a team.

64
00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.560
Having you marry my daughter is truly a blessing to the Lannister family.

65
00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.560
Thank you.

66
00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.560
Thank you.

67
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.560
You're all so kind.

68
00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.560
To the banquet?

69
00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.560
Yes.

70
00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:23.919
I'm not sure.

71
00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:24.919
Oh.

72
00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:25.919
Oh, Jan.

73
00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:29.919
I can't believe you actually managed to sneak in here with this hope.

74
00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:30.979
Leave us alone.

75
00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:34.039
Trying to make me jealous, right?

76
00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:36.560
Alright, I guess I can write you a check.

77
00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.000
How's a million?

78
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.960
Enough, right?

79
00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.960
Now stop pestering me.

80
00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.120
Just a million.

81
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:50.120
Don't embarrass yourself.

82
00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.960
There you rip up my check.

83
00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.189
Well, that was the nice way.

84
00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:00.669
Because it was either the check.

85
00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:01.669
Or your filthy mouth.

86
00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:03.669
Oh.

87
00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:04.669
I'm serious.

88
00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:06.949
What's wrong?

89
00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:10.590
Gentlemen, I apologize.

90
00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.590
This stalker is my ex.

91
00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.590
And she's incredibly unhappy because I dumped her.

92
00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:16.589
Mm-hmm.

93
00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:18.589
So she's trying to provoke me by marrying this hobo.

94
00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:20.589
I'll have this taken care of.

95
00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:22.589
She'll be removed immediately.

96
00:04:22.589 --> 00:04:23.589
I'm sorry.

97
00:04:23.589 --> 00:04:28.589
But if you kick me out, I'm afraid we'd have to cancel the whole event.

98
00:04:28.589 --> 00:04:29.589
Hm.

99
00:04:29.589 --> 00:04:30.589
I've heard of you.

100
00:04:30.589 --> 00:04:32.589
You're the simple delivery girl, right?

101
00:04:32.589 --> 00:04:34.589
Coming here and talking.

102
00:04:34.589 --> 00:04:35.589
Shit.

103
00:04:35.589 --> 00:04:38.589
Do you know that Mr. Baratheon is the one that organized this event?

104
00:04:38.589 --> 00:04:40.589
Dad, I didn't know that.

105
00:04:40.589 --> 00:04:42.069
Because I asked him to.

106
00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:46.500
You talk to him that way.

107
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:47.500
I swear.

108
00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.420
I'll rip that mouth straight off.

109
00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:54.470
Yeah.

110
00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.600
Love to see you try.

111
00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:19.040
I would love to see you try.

112
00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.040
You should choose another seat.

113
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.040
Look at them.

114
00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:22.959
They're all freaking out.

115
00:05:22.959 --> 00:05:24.670
I'm the seat.

116
00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:27.829
That is the Baratheon seat.

117
00:05:27.829 --> 00:05:31.829
That is for the organizer and the event holder.

118
00:05:31.829 --> 00:05:33.829
Dad, how dare you?

119
00:05:33.829 --> 00:05:35.149
I know what.

120
00:05:35.149 --> 00:05:39.160
This chair's just...

121
00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:43.329
Thanks, honey.

122
00:05:43.329 --> 00:05:44.329
You should get a bigger one.

123
00:05:44.329 --> 00:05:46.589
Listen up, everyone.

124
00:05:46.589 --> 00:05:50.589
If she pisses off Mr. Baratheon, we are the ones to blame.

125
00:05:50.589 --> 00:05:52.589
And our businesses will take the heat.

126
00:05:52.589 --> 00:05:54.589
We need to make sure that she leaves right now.

127
00:05:54.589 --> 00:05:55.810
I agree.

128
00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:58.810
Our family status relies on Mr. Baratheon.

129
00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:02.879
If you disrespect him, you are our enemy.

130
00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:07.959
You have three seconds to get off that cheat.

131
00:06:07.959 --> 00:06:13.959
If not, I will make sure that your name is plastered all over the headlines and the billboards.

132
00:06:13.959 --> 00:06:14.959
Hmm.

133
00:06:14.959 --> 00:06:16.959
Let's see.

134
00:06:16.959 --> 00:06:20.959
What about we call you a racist?

135
00:06:20.959 --> 00:06:22.959
Oh, yeah.

136
00:06:22.959 --> 00:06:26.959
Your life will be ruined.

137
00:06:26.959 --> 00:06:29.600
Oh, listen up, everyone.

138
00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.600
She is truly a marvel of leading manipulation.

139
00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:36.180
I hope you like concrete coffin suite up.

140
00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.180
That's my gang specialty.

141
00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:39.370
Morning.

142
00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:45.490
Anyone else here please come for the more creative threat.

143
00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:47.490
Dying is too easy for her.

144
00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:49.560
I'll arrest her.

145
00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:54.560
A dirty wench like her deserves to be thrown into a women's prison on an isolated island.

146
00:06:54.560 --> 00:07:00.490
Try virus five.

147
00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:04.490
We just developed one touch and your skin will dissulate.

148
00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:06.259
Oh, scary!

149
00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:08.259
I thought the FDA's were going to long long.

150
00:07:08.259 --> 00:07:11.439
Try this.

151
00:07:11.439 --> 00:07:15.560
Let's see how that smart-ass mouth runs with one shot of this.

152
00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.560
No one puts their hands on him.

153
00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:20.560
Not on my watch.

154
00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.560
Dare you touch me, bum.

155
00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.560
I'll make your life a living hell.

156
00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:25.980
Dear father-in-law.

157
00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:26.980
Let me do it.

158
00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:27.980
Oh, yeah.

159
00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:28.980
I'll ruin that bitch's face.

160
00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:29.980
No one will ever want to see her.

161
00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:33.620
Mr. Tyrion and Bratty is here.

162
00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.620
Mr. Tyrion and Bratty is here.

163
00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:41.910
Why do you join the festivities?

164
00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:45.060
It ended up beautiful day.

165
00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:47.339
Yeah.

166
00:07:47.339 --> 00:07:50.000
Very good.

167
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
So good to see everyone.

168
00:07:52.000 --> 00:08:01.170
It just can't be.

169
00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:02.170
She must be important.

170
00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:04.170
He just bowed to her.

171
00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:05.170
No way.

172
00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:07.589
If she can boss Mr. Baratheon around.

173
00:08:07.589 --> 00:08:09.589
Why'd he go easy on her ex?

174
00:08:09.589 --> 00:08:10.589
He would've saw him a pop.

175
00:08:10.589 --> 00:08:13.589
But Mr. Baratheon did just take a knee to her.

176
00:08:13.589 --> 00:08:16.620
Brion doesn't know Mr. Baratheon.

177
00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:17.620
Does she?

178
00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:21.899
I heard Tyrion only bows the Targaryens.

179
00:08:21.899 --> 00:08:23.899
So, she's telling the truth.

180
00:08:23.899 --> 00:08:25.899
She's Lady Targaryen.

181
00:08:25.899 --> 00:08:27.060
For real?

182
00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:28.060
Bring on the show, boys!

183
00:08:28.060 --> 00:09:00.799
Join the show, my lady.

184
00:09:00.799 --> 00:09:06.169
Do enjoy looking at muscular men.

185
00:09:06.169 --> 00:09:08.169
Paris seemed to watch this in front of my new husband.

186
00:09:08.169 --> 00:09:10.460
If he thinks I'm really that horny.

187
00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:11.460
Oh.

188
00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:13.460
What is this Tyrion up to?

189
00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:16.460
They would think I can't satisfy my wife.

190
00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:18.460
And she has to go for strippers?

191
00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:21.460
Now I understand why this serious gets special treatments.

192
00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:24.460
It turns out Tyrion goes both ways.

193
00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:26.460
If Jaime knew these male strippers were from me,

194
00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:29.460
it ruined my reputation as an elegant lady.

195
00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:33.379
That bitch is leaving!

196
00:09:33.379 --> 00:09:46.049
Rumor has it that Mr. Baratheon is under the Targaryens.

197
00:09:46.049 --> 00:09:48.049
Is she really one of the Targaryens?

198
00:09:48.049 --> 00:09:51.080
T, please just hide my identity.

199
00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:53.080
I don't want Jaime to get weird ideas about me.

200
00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:57.080
Mr. Baratheon, I'm so sorry that I took your seat.

201
00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:59.080
It was very rude of me.

202
00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:00.080
Oh.

203
00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:02.080
My lady wants her identity veiled.

204
00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.529
I should act along.

205
00:10:04.529 --> 00:10:06.649
See?

206
00:10:06.649 --> 00:10:09.000
Mr. Baratheon was calling her rude.

207
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.000
Not defending her.

208
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.259
Yes, but Mr. Baratheon just kneeled before her.

209
00:10:14.259 --> 00:10:22.120
I was taking a knee to the Targaryen crest

210
00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:23.120
on the chair.

211
00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:26.120
They rule over the entire empire's wealth.

212
00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:29.919
Lie on them for all sorts of this.

213
00:10:29.919 --> 00:10:32.820
That is why I take a knee.

214
00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:38.000
I see the Targaryen crest.

215
00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.120
That convinces him, surprisingly.

216
00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:44.409
Mr. Baratheon, she sat in the chair.

217
00:10:44.409 --> 00:10:47.409
Doesn't that tarnish the sacredness behind the Targaryen crest?

218
00:10:47.409 --> 00:10:49.570
It's a very good point.

219
00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:56.690
But has anyone died when a beautiful lady has sat in the chair?

220
00:10:57.690 --> 00:11:05.110
The Targaryen family is very reclusive.

221
00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:09.539
We don't tolerate bullies.

222
00:11:09.539 --> 00:11:17.269
Which one of you just harmed her just now?

223
00:11:17.269 --> 00:11:29.919
Start talking!

224
00:11:29.919 --> 00:11:30.919
It wasn't me.

225
00:11:30.919 --> 00:11:32.919
I don't even have the virus on me.

226
00:11:32.919 --> 00:11:38.080
We're at the end.

227
00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:39.559
Please.

228
00:11:39.559 --> 00:11:40.559
I'm sorry.

229
00:11:40.559 --> 00:11:41.559
Please don't hurt me.

230
00:11:41.559 --> 00:11:44.870
My lady.

231
00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:47.759
How do you wish to punish him?

232
00:11:47.759 --> 00:11:54.019
How do you wish to punish him?

233
00:11:54.019 --> 00:11:56.659
You know, I don't really know all that much about punishment,

234
00:11:56.659 --> 00:11:59.659
but these guys really do seem to be experts.

235
00:11:59.659 --> 00:12:01.659
Very well then.

236
00:12:01.659 --> 00:12:05.139
And like me, gentlemen, what should we do with him?

237
00:12:05.139 --> 00:12:11.960
You go on.

238
00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:15.730
Please tell him what you just told me.

239
00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:23.759
I would blacklist him and his entire family from our hospital.

240
00:12:23.759 --> 00:12:29.759
I would deny them any treatment and a simple viral flu would kill him.

241
00:12:29.759 --> 00:12:30.759
Easily.

242
00:12:30.759 --> 00:12:34.759
I'll make him human punch back in our gang.

243
00:12:34.759 --> 00:12:37.759
One punch from everyone until he's pulp and we're a big gang.

244
00:12:37.759 --> 00:12:39.519
Easy.

245
00:12:39.519 --> 00:12:42.590
We'll cook up his scandals.

246
00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:46.590
He'll be a laughing stop for generations.

247
00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:50.389
For the rest of his life.

248
00:12:50.389 --> 00:12:52.740
He'd be in prison.

249
00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:56.740
I'll have police arrest him and they'll throw him in with the worst of criminals.

250
00:12:56.740 --> 00:13:00.740
And I bet he'd be their favorite pudding.

251
00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:03.769
He'd be in the sense.

252
00:13:03.769 --> 00:13:07.399
Really nice Christmas gifts.

253
00:13:07.399 --> 00:13:10.679
Super at the end.

254
00:13:10.679 --> 00:13:11.679
Please.

255
00:13:11.679 --> 00:13:12.679
Please spare me.

256
00:13:12.679 --> 00:13:14.679
Oh, please.

257
00:13:14.679 --> 00:13:26.399
Why are you begging me when your fate is in her hands?

258
00:13:26.399 --> 00:13:30.159
I'm so sorry for your hands, please.

259
00:13:30.159 --> 00:13:32.450
Don't deserve this apology for me.

260
00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:33.450
The almighty of us.

261
00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:38.990
Mr. Baratheon, I prepared this entire banquet just for you.

262
00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:41.820
Because she disrespected you.

263
00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:44.820
Hey, as a matter of fact, I know that your birthdays are on the corner,

264
00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:51.559
so I prepared a little gift in exchange for your forgiveness for my little mistake.

265
00:13:51.559 --> 00:13:52.559
Wow.

266
00:13:52.559 --> 00:13:58.860
You know, I would really love to see whatever treasures you've collected.

267
00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:02.860
Bring over the Protect the Leap Grandmaster Watch.

268
00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:03.990
It's worth over a second.

269
00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:11.289
Why are you laughing?

270
00:14:11.289 --> 00:14:14.570
That's your gift.

271
00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:15.570
A sitting watch.

272
00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:18.570
What do you have against my watch?

273
00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:26.679
I mean, they're you.

274
00:14:26.679 --> 00:14:27.679
$31 million.

275
00:14:27.679 --> 00:14:31.679
That's more than your entire lifetime of salaries could amount to.

276
00:14:31.679 --> 00:14:33.679
Delivery girl.

277
00:14:33.679 --> 00:14:36.679
What did you get Mr. Baratheon yourself?

278
00:14:36.679 --> 00:14:39.679
How about you show us before you start mocking our gifts?

279
00:14:39.679 --> 00:14:46.419
Would I get teary in gifts?

280
00:14:46.419 --> 00:14:51.789
Of course, she has better gifts than you.

281
00:14:51.789 --> 00:15:06.440
Of course, she has better gifts than you.

282
00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:10.440
The original Marvel Statue of the Veiled Lady by Raphael Monty.

283
00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:17.559
The original by Monty.

284
00:15:17.559 --> 00:15:19.559
That's worth $1.5 billion.

285
00:15:19.559 --> 00:15:22.559
That's not just something you can buy.

286
00:15:22.559 --> 00:15:24.559
The Princess Victoria.

287
00:15:24.559 --> 00:15:28.299
The largest cruise ship in the city.

288
00:15:28.299 --> 00:15:29.299
Oh my God, that's real.

289
00:15:29.299 --> 00:15:32.299
That's the actual plaque from the Princess Victoria.

290
00:15:32.299 --> 00:15:34.299
It's worth more than $2 billion.

291
00:15:34.299 --> 00:15:37.299
And the private island.

292
00:15:37.299 --> 00:15:44.129
In the Pacific Ocean.

293
00:15:44.129 --> 00:15:48.129
You know, you can't even buy a window on the Princess Victoria.

294
00:15:48.129 --> 00:15:50.129
With that $31 million watch.

295
00:15:50.129 --> 00:15:52.159
You get this.

296
00:15:52.159 --> 00:15:53.159
Sir?

297
00:15:53.159 --> 00:15:54.159
I think it's a bend over.

298
00:15:54.159 --> 00:15:59.330
Do you like the gifts you got from Mr. Baratheon, I do?

299
00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:00.720
Why, yes.

300
00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:02.720
I got him something good.

301
00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:08.690
Your lies are beginning to be a bit unrealistic.

302
00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:09.690
They're very unbelievable.

303
00:16:10.690 --> 00:16:13.240
The Marvels, don't you?

304
00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:17.240
And the island are both auctioned off by Mr. Stark.

305
00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:20.100
How did Hobo get his hands on these?

306
00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:24.340
How did Hobo get his hands on these?

307
00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:28.139
Don't tell me he's actually Mr. Stark.

308
00:16:28.139 --> 00:16:29.139
Don't worry.

309
00:16:29.139 --> 00:16:31.139
I'll help you cover up for your over exaggerated lies.

310
00:16:31.139 --> 00:16:33.139
They're all real.

311
00:16:33.139 --> 00:16:35.139
Hey, Hobo.

312
00:16:35.139 --> 00:16:39.200
Do you really think you can get away with telling some random stories

313
00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:43.200
by passing off some useless stones and worthless plaques?

314
00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:46.590
Rianne, your broke husband installed.

315
00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:48.070
Exactly.

316
00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:51.070
How could this low life have all this?

317
00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:52.070
He's lying.

318
00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:55.440
Don't you?

319
00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:57.440
You fucking nutheads.

320
00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:04.440
You present these fake gifts and you've destroyed the Sarrias's $31 million watch.

321
00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:07.440
You have a death wish.

322
00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:09.440
Calm down everyone.

323
00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:11.440
It's just a few billion.

324
00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:12.440
My bother.

325
00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:14.640
You arrogant lunatic.

326
00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:17.640
Mr. Baratheon, he is clearly full of shit.

327
00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:19.640
Please kick him out.

328
00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:22.500
I say we banish him.

329
00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:24.500
Make sure he's never seen this country.

330
00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:30.500
Disrespecting Mr. Baratheon is disrespecting all our families.

331
00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:35.109
Well, I'm sure Mr. Baratheon will be able to find out.

332
00:17:35.109 --> 00:17:37.329
Are they really fake?

333
00:17:37.329 --> 00:17:39.329
Is that even necessary?

334
00:17:39.329 --> 00:17:43.329
I swear with my own eyes, I saw this Hobo.

335
00:17:44.329 --> 00:17:47.359
Steel food from a stray dog.

336
00:17:47.359 --> 00:17:49.359
There's no way he can be a star.

337
00:17:49.359 --> 00:17:51.359
Mr. Baratheon, you need to kick him out now.

338
00:17:51.359 --> 00:17:56.359
Else you run the risk of offending the real Mr. Stark in the entire South.

339
00:17:56.359 --> 00:17:58.930
Shut up.

340
00:17:58.930 --> 00:18:19.230
Tell me what to do.

341
00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:24.009
These gifts are genuine.

342
00:18:24.009 --> 00:18:26.009
These gifts are genuine.

343
00:18:26.009 --> 00:18:29.480
What?

344
00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:30.480
Not bad to you.

345
00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:32.480
He really knows how to wing it.

346
00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:35.480
My lady finally has a better eye.

347
00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:37.480
This one is much better than the last.

348
00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:39.480
How is that possible?

349
00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:41.480
He sleeps on the street.

350
00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:44.480
Maybe Mr. Baratheon is wrong.

351
00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:47.279
Then I'll say anything else.

352
00:18:47.279 --> 00:18:48.279
I'll miss him.

353
00:18:48.279 --> 00:18:49.279
Whatever.

354
00:18:49.279 --> 00:18:51.690
They're for Mr. Baratheon.

355
00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:53.690
Not us.

356
00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:57.559
Who said all these gifts are for Mr. Baratheon?

357
00:18:57.559 --> 00:18:59.559
They're actually for my wife, Brienne.

358
00:18:59.559 --> 00:19:02.680
They're wedding gifts from the House of Stark.

359
00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:08.569
Fitch like Brienne does not deserve these kinds of wedding gifts.

360
00:19:08.569 --> 00:19:09.569
I knew it.

361
00:19:09.569 --> 00:19:11.569
You're just a fucking actor.

362
00:19:11.569 --> 00:19:12.569
You shameless hobo.

363
00:19:12.569 --> 00:19:13.569
Tyrion?

364
00:19:13.569 --> 00:19:15.890
I want him to suffer.

365
00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:20.740
You fucking father.

366
00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:30.319
How dare you hit me?

367
00:19:30.319 --> 00:19:31.319
What did I do?

368
00:19:31.319 --> 00:19:32.319
I'm decent for this.

369
00:19:32.319 --> 00:19:33.319
I miss Brienne.

370
00:19:33.319 --> 00:19:35.829
I ditched this bitch.

371
00:19:35.829 --> 00:19:37.829
Why are you all defending her?

372
00:19:37.829 --> 00:19:38.829
Seriously.

373
00:19:38.829 --> 00:19:52.089
Three minutes.

374
00:19:52.089 --> 00:19:55.089
I went to Ceres, Martell, Bankrupt.

375
00:19:55.089 --> 00:19:57.980
Three minutes.

376
00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:00.980
I went to Ceres, Martell, Bankrupt.

377
00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:07.309
Who the hell are you to do that?

378
00:20:07.309 --> 00:20:10.309
Trying to get the Martell family to go bankrupt.

379
00:20:10.309 --> 00:20:12.309
Are you trying to back him up?

380
00:20:12.309 --> 00:20:15.309
Mr. Baratheon, the Sirius has made mistakes.

381
00:20:15.309 --> 00:20:17.309
He's still a talented businessman.

382
00:20:17.309 --> 00:20:18.309
You said so yourself.

383
00:20:18.309 --> 00:20:19.309
He's talented.

384
00:20:19.309 --> 00:20:24.470
This man has gone bankrupt multiple times and I had to save his ass.

385
00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:28.359
Every single time it happened.

386
00:20:28.359 --> 00:20:38.279
Boss, someone is targeting us in a stock market and our company just went bankrupt.

387
00:20:38.279 --> 00:20:42.180
Bankrupting a company in minutes?

388
00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:44.180
Is that hobo really Mr. Stark?

389
00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:46.329
No way.

390
00:20:46.329 --> 00:20:49.329
It must be Mr. Baratheon who did that.

391
00:20:49.329 --> 00:20:53.869
Bankrupting isn't the only price you'll be paying.

392
00:20:53.869 --> 00:20:55.029
Boys!

393
00:20:55.029 --> 00:20:56.029
Come on in!

394
00:20:56.029 --> 00:21:04.910
Excuse me, wait.

395
00:21:04.910 --> 00:21:07.740
Send this man to Japan.

396
00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:12.980
He would be great in a porno and I want him to be famous.

397
00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:13.980
Leave that, don't want it.

398
00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:22.369
Bad enough.

399
00:21:22.369 --> 00:21:26.170
Mr. Baratheon, this is way too much.

400
00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:29.170
Now you kick out a CEO and you let this bum stay.

401
00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:31.170
This is outrageous.

402
00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:35.710
Mr. Lannister, if you have a problem with that, you could join the bankruptcy club too.

403
00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:45.420
Well, Mr. Baratheon insists that I'm fine with letting the gentlemen stay.

404
00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:50.769
But everyone must pass the credit verification in order to bid, right?

405
00:21:50.769 --> 00:21:51.769
Everyone agrees?

406
00:21:51.769 --> 00:21:52.769
Yeah, yes.

407
00:21:52.769 --> 00:22:01.500
Jamie's guests are worth $10 billion.

408
00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:04.500
He'll have no issue with the capital verification.

409
00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:06.500
We'll do it the usual way.

410
00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:07.500
One at a time.

411
00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:16.730
$700 million.

412
00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:18.730
Second class.

413
00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:22.880
$800 million.

414
00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:23.880
Second class.

415
00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:29.400
Second class.

416
00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:31.400
$900 million.

417
00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:32.400
Second class.

418
00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:37.690
$2 billion.

419
00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:40.619
First class.

420
00:22:40.619 --> 00:22:51.819
The Lannister family is the best among the four of us.

421
00:22:51.819 --> 00:22:53.819
Impressive Lannister.

422
00:22:53.819 --> 00:22:54.819
Yes.

423
00:22:54.819 --> 00:22:55.819
I agree.

424
00:22:55.819 --> 00:22:57.940
Here.

425
00:22:57.940 --> 00:23:01.539
You can use my card.

426
00:23:01.539 --> 00:23:02.700
Don't worry.

427
00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:03.700
I got this.

428
00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:09.750
Five black cards from the prestigious Targaryen Bank.

429
00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:12.839
Mr. Stark.

430
00:23:12.839 --> 00:23:14.839
The Targaryen banks.

431
00:23:14.839 --> 00:23:16.839
Black VIP cards.

432
00:23:16.839 --> 00:23:18.839
They're only five available worldwide.

433
00:23:18.839 --> 00:23:20.839
I can't even get my hand on one of them.

434
00:23:20.839 --> 00:23:21.839
That's pretty bull.

435
00:23:21.839 --> 00:23:24.839
Actually, that's quite fucking dumb to claim that you have all five.

436
00:23:24.839 --> 00:23:26.839
That's right.

437
00:23:26.839 --> 00:23:28.839
Don't make things up.

438
00:23:28.839 --> 00:23:30.839
Five black cards.

439
00:23:30.839 --> 00:23:32.839
Do you think we are stupid?

440
00:23:32.839 --> 00:23:35.869
If I'm lying, I'll find out soon enough.

441
00:23:35.869 --> 00:23:38.799
All officiates.

442
00:23:38.799 --> 00:23:42.299
All officiates.

443
00:23:42.299 --> 00:23:44.299
Hey, no.

444
00:23:44.299 --> 00:23:47.299
My husband seems to have snatched some money away on this card.

445
00:23:47.299 --> 00:23:48.559
Please.

446
00:23:48.559 --> 00:23:50.559
Use this one.

447
00:23:50.559 --> 00:23:55.559
It's just a normal bank card, but it should contain a little more than the Lannisters.

448
00:23:55.559 --> 00:23:56.559
I think.

449
00:23:56.559 --> 00:23:57.559
I have a question.

450
00:23:57.559 --> 00:23:59.559
Did you two get married in a Santa's time?

451
00:23:59.559 --> 00:24:00.559
Because you're nuts.

452
00:24:00.559 --> 00:24:02.559
I dare you to swipe that card.

453
00:24:02.559 --> 00:24:03.559
Show us what you got.

454
00:24:03.559 --> 00:24:06.000
Stay quiet behind me.

455
00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.059
Don't worry.

456
00:24:07.059 --> 00:24:08.059
My balance is enough.

457
00:24:08.059 --> 00:24:10.059
Actually, I can't cover up for your toy cards.

458
00:24:10.059 --> 00:24:13.059
You don't have to act like your card is real.

459
00:24:13.059 --> 00:24:14.059
I got this.

460
00:24:14.059 --> 00:24:15.059
I could say the same thing to you.

461
00:24:15.059 --> 00:24:17.190
What are you two stammering about?

462
00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:18.190
What?

463
00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:19.190
You're gonna shake your pants?

464
00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:21.190
Shut up, Lannister.

465
00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:23.190
Mr. Stark is speaking to his wife.

466
00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:25.670
Don't let them.

467
00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:27.670
Rando, stop the act.

468
00:24:27.670 --> 00:24:32.670
We know you're just a delivery girl and a hobo.

469
00:24:32.670 --> 00:24:35.670
You know, I have Mr. Stark's brother, Stannis.

470
00:24:35.670 --> 00:24:37.670
He's in the North right now as well.

471
00:24:37.670 --> 00:24:41.670
Why don't we ask Stannis to come see his brother?

472
00:24:41.670 --> 00:24:43.700
I second that.

473
00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:45.700
Stannis is close by.

474
00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:48.309
He could just cop over.

475
00:24:48.309 --> 00:24:50.309
If Stannis comes, I won't be able to cover up for you in the highs.

476
00:24:50.309 --> 00:24:52.309
I heard he's really intense.

477
00:24:52.309 --> 00:24:55.309
Mr. Rothy, please swipe it from me.

478
00:24:55.309 --> 00:25:12.660
Platinum.

479
00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:21.420
I think I'd never see in a class platinum.

480
00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:24.579
I'm a Lannister and I'm only first class.

481
00:25:24.579 --> 00:25:27.579
How could you, an ordinary girl, be a platinum?

482
00:25:27.579 --> 00:25:29.579
Don't tell me.

483
00:25:29.579 --> 00:25:32.609
She's a lady from the Targaryen family for real.

484
00:25:32.609 --> 00:25:35.609
That would explain why Mr. Baratheon keeps defending her.

485
00:25:35.609 --> 00:25:38.609
Have we offended the lady?

486
00:25:38.609 --> 00:25:41.609
She's really a Targaryen in secret.

487
00:25:41.609 --> 00:25:48.519
Oh, well that makes sense now.

488
00:25:48.519 --> 00:25:52.519
This explains how a delivery girl could have $100 billion.

489
00:25:52.519 --> 00:25:54.640
The machine is broken.

490
00:25:54.640 --> 00:26:00.440
It's broken? A broken machine is with you.

491
00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:02.500
It's not my fault, lady.

492
00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:05.819
The machine has never seen this much money before.

493
00:26:05.819 --> 00:26:07.819
Makes sense, the machine's broken.

494
00:26:07.819 --> 00:26:08.819
She got pretty lucky though.

495
00:26:08.819 --> 00:26:12.299
This is all part of your scheme.

496
00:26:12.299 --> 00:26:14.299
You knew it was broken.

497
00:26:14.299 --> 00:26:16.299
You're sly for your age.

498
00:26:16.299 --> 00:26:18.299
You know you almost fooled us.

499
00:26:18.299 --> 00:26:21.299
Someone get us another machine.

500
00:26:21.299 --> 00:26:25.160
I dare you to do that again, delivery girl.

501
00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:29.309
I have nothing to...

502
00:26:29.309 --> 00:26:30.309
Rothy, swipe my card.

503
00:26:30.309 --> 00:26:44.180
Class platinum.

504
00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:46.369
Class platinum.

505
00:26:46.369 --> 00:26:55.240
Class platinum.

506
00:26:55.240 --> 00:27:04.730
Class platinum.

507
00:27:04.730 --> 00:27:06.730
Whoa, tea really rocks.

508
00:27:06.730 --> 00:27:08.730
He prepared fake machines ahead of time.

509
00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:09.730
So well thought out.

510
00:27:09.730 --> 00:27:11.730
No wonder my dad loves him.

511
00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:14.049
Lannister, anything else?

512
00:27:14.049 --> 00:27:16.049
This machine is brand new.

513
00:27:16.049 --> 00:27:18.210
That's impossible.

514
00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:20.210
I don't know how that happened.

515
00:27:20.210 --> 00:27:25.400
I mean, how could this hobo have the black platinum cards?

516
00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:26.400
You must have found them in the trash.

517
00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:27.400
I told you.

518
00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:29.400
I'm Jaime Stark.

519
00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:31.400
The head of the Stark household.

520
00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:33.400
It's no wonder I have these cards.

521
00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:37.400
You know, sometimes I wonder how you idiots are even my competition.

522
00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:39.400
You want more proof?

523
00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:44.400
Did you know that at every Stark hotel is a secret passageway?

524
00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:47.400
And only the CEO knows the key word to them.

525
00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:49.690
What are you trying to say?

526
00:27:49.690 --> 00:27:55.240
You're too stupid to ask questions.

527
00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:59.710
He's not really lost in the story again.

528
00:27:59.710 --> 00:28:00.710
Can you please cover us?

529
00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:01.710
I have to get him out of here.

530
00:28:01.710 --> 00:28:06.960
What's going on?

531
00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:08.960
They hit it off.

532
00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:15.410
If he knows the key word password, then he is Mr. Stark.

533
00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:31.640
The pattern on this lock is from the Stark family.

534
00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:33.640
This is a secret passage.

535
00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:48.980
Mr. Stark.

536
00:28:48.980 --> 00:29:02.369
Mr. Stark.

537
00:29:02.369 --> 00:29:04.369
We married some random person.

538
00:29:04.369 --> 00:29:07.400
Turns out it was the South's richest bachelor.

539
00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:09.400
If you're lucky now.

540
00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:12.460
You can't say I don't.

541
00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:15.039
Mr. Stark.

542
00:29:15.039 --> 00:29:20.039
Lannister fooled me into thinking you both were intruders.

543
00:29:20.039 --> 00:29:23.039
I never meant to offend you and your wife.

544
00:29:23.039 --> 00:29:25.039
Me neither, Mr. Stark.

545
00:29:25.039 --> 00:29:27.039
I was in stupid.

546
00:29:27.039 --> 00:29:28.039
Lady Bran.

547
00:29:28.039 --> 00:29:33.049
I am so sorry.

548
00:29:33.049 --> 00:29:35.759
It was Lannister's fault.

549
00:29:35.759 --> 00:29:38.039
I'm just a don't readout.

550
00:29:38.039 --> 00:29:40.490
You know how we learn your creatures?

551
00:29:40.490 --> 00:29:42.490
I told her to change this.

552
00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:44.490
You are all assholes.

553
00:29:44.490 --> 00:29:45.490
That's enough.

554
00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:47.490
All of you are idiots.

555
00:29:47.490 --> 00:29:49.490
Stupid enough to be fooled.

556
00:29:49.490 --> 00:29:50.490
I know.

557
00:29:50.490 --> 00:29:53.490
I think it's time to make a change within the North's upper echelon.

558
00:29:53.490 --> 00:29:55.490
What do you think, Mr. Baratheon?

559
00:29:55.490 --> 00:29:58.259
Mr. Stark is right.

560
00:29:58.259 --> 00:30:07.259
From this day forward, any company that deals with Stark or Baratheon will no longer do business with your four families will make you bankrupt.

561
00:30:07.259 --> 00:30:09.259
Go forward, Mr. Baratheon.

562
00:30:09.259 --> 00:30:10.259
Of course.

563
00:30:10.259 --> 00:30:16.900
Since they can't place the bed, the Stark will run the project.

564
00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:17.900
This is bullshit.

565
00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:18.900
Oh no.

566
00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:19.900
No.

567
00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:20.900
Come on.

568
00:30:22.089 --> 00:30:24.220
You better watch your back.

569
00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:33.059
Bran!

570
00:30:33.059 --> 00:30:36.910
I'm sorry.

571
00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:49.250
The Duke personally picked out these strippers for you.

572
00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:53.250
And you got married that award and your father has worried about your happiness.

573
00:30:53.250 --> 00:30:54.250
What?

574
00:30:54.250 --> 00:30:55.250
Am I your snitching on me?

575
00:30:55.250 --> 00:30:56.250
No, no, no.

576
00:30:56.250 --> 00:30:57.250
That's not what I'm trying to say.

577
00:30:57.250 --> 00:30:59.250
I'm trying to hear to help you in that you don't understand.

578
00:30:59.250 --> 00:31:05.599
No, no, no.

579
00:31:05.599 --> 00:31:07.599
How come she's so close with Mr. Baratheon?

580
00:31:07.599 --> 00:31:08.599
She is lover.

581
00:31:08.599 --> 00:31:10.599
My dad has bad taste.

582
00:31:10.599 --> 00:31:13.490
These strippers have nothing on my husband.

583
00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:19.509
And tell them I'm married so we can get this nonsense over with.

584
00:31:19.509 --> 00:31:22.339
My lady, I will talk to the Duke personally.

585
00:31:22.339 --> 00:31:27.759
This is all your fault, Bran.

586
00:31:27.759 --> 00:31:30.799
You're dead if I see you again.

587
00:31:30.799 --> 00:31:39.000
What are you doing here?

588
00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000
Aren't you about the shooting porn?

589
00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.000
Bran, I'm so sorry.

590
00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.730
I love you, Bran.

591
00:31:45.730 --> 00:31:46.730
Marjorie fooled me.

592
00:31:46.730 --> 00:31:48.730
Have you been hitting the head?

593
00:31:48.730 --> 00:31:51.890
Do you not forget how you just insulted me?

594
00:31:51.890 --> 00:31:52.890
What is wrong with you?

595
00:31:52.890 --> 00:31:54.890
Bran, it's all Marjorie's fault.

596
00:31:54.890 --> 00:31:56.890
You're so good to me.

597
00:31:56.890 --> 00:31:57.890
How could I not love you?

598
00:31:57.890 --> 00:31:58.890
Please.

599
00:31:58.890 --> 00:31:59.890
I can be yours again.

600
00:31:59.890 --> 00:32:01.890
I can be your only lover.

601
00:32:01.890 --> 00:32:06.390
You, not the other woman, your cheater.

602
00:32:06.390 --> 00:32:07.390
Open your cheater.

603
00:32:07.390 --> 00:32:08.390
Leave me alone.

604
00:32:08.390 --> 00:32:09.390
Bring out.

605
00:32:09.390 --> 00:32:11.440
Bring out.

606
00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:12.440
Have you forgotten?

607
00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:14.759
I saved your life three years ago.

608
00:32:14.759 --> 00:32:16.759
This is not how you should repay someone.

609
00:32:16.759 --> 00:32:18.960
You piece of shit.

610
00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:22.049
I would have rather you left me on the curb.

611
00:32:22.049 --> 00:32:26.049
And I've done enough to repay you for everything you've done.

612
00:32:26.049 --> 00:32:28.049
You're pathetic.

613
00:32:28.049 --> 00:32:29.049
Leave me alone.

614
00:32:29.049 --> 00:32:32.049
Or I will cut your limbs off.

615
00:32:32.049 --> 00:32:35.140
Grateful bitch.

616
00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:37.140
I saved your life.

617
00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:39.519
You're so shameless, Viserys.

618
00:32:39.519 --> 00:32:42.519
Taking credit for things you didn't do.

619
00:32:42.519 --> 00:32:46.220
What are you talking about?

620
00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:48.220
A brian don't listen to this playboy.

621
00:32:48.220 --> 00:32:50.220
Halloween three years ago.

622
00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:52.220
I had a flight to catch.

623
00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:55.220
So I had my men take breed of the hospital after I saved her.

624
00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:58.569
I never thought someone else would take credit for something.

625
00:32:58.569 --> 00:32:59.569
The audacity.

626
00:32:59.569 --> 00:33:01.569
You were the one that saved me?

627
00:33:01.569 --> 00:33:02.569
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

628
00:33:02.569 --> 00:33:04.569
Brian, don't listen to him.

629
00:33:04.569 --> 00:33:08.569
For three years, you dishonored and manipulated her.

630
00:33:08.569 --> 00:33:11.569
For things you didn't do, that's unforgivable.

631
00:33:11.569 --> 00:33:12.569
Nonsense.

632
00:33:12.569 --> 00:33:15.859
Brian, I took you to the hospital.

633
00:33:15.859 --> 00:33:16.859
You saw me there.

634
00:33:16.859 --> 00:33:17.859
Really?

635
00:33:17.859 --> 00:33:18.859
Really?

636
00:33:18.859 --> 00:33:20.859
How many of her bones were broken then?

637
00:33:20.859 --> 00:33:21.859
What do you care?

638
00:33:21.859 --> 00:33:22.859
Fine.

639
00:33:22.859 --> 00:33:24.859
It was three.

640
00:33:24.859 --> 00:33:26.049
Period.

641
00:33:26.049 --> 00:33:29.049
You don't even know about my injuries.

642
00:33:29.049 --> 00:33:33.180
And I was stupid enough to do everything for you for three years.

643
00:33:33.180 --> 00:33:34.180
So what?

644
00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:35.180
I bet he doesn't know either.

645
00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:37.210
She had abdominal injuries.

646
00:33:37.210 --> 00:33:39.400
I hired Dr. Catree.

647
00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:42.400
You're the best surgeons in the world to take care of.

648
00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:44.759
You must see who saved me.

649
00:33:44.759 --> 00:33:45.759
He's a trap.

650
00:33:45.759 --> 00:33:48.009
He's lying about the doctors.

651
00:33:48.009 --> 00:33:49.009
Brian.

652
00:33:49.009 --> 00:33:50.240
We don't know.

653
00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:51.720
Know what?

654
00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:54.359
This is Mr. Stark.

655
00:33:54.359 --> 00:33:56.359
The CEO of the Stark Groot?

656
00:33:56.359 --> 00:33:58.359
The richest man in the South.

657
00:33:58.359 --> 00:34:03.079
I don't believe this.

658
00:34:03.079 --> 00:34:05.079
Mr. Stark is in the South?

659
00:34:05.079 --> 00:34:06.079
There's no way he's here.

660
00:34:06.079 --> 00:34:07.079
Guards!

661
00:34:07.079 --> 00:34:09.719
Throw this man in the sea.

662
00:34:09.719 --> 00:34:10.719
No.

663
00:34:10.719 --> 00:34:12.719
The whales and feasts at Brian.

664
00:34:12.719 --> 00:34:13.719
Brian, I love you.

665
00:34:13.719 --> 00:34:15.719
Three years, Brian!

666
00:34:15.719 --> 00:34:20.679
Wait!

667
00:34:20.679 --> 00:34:22.159
What?

668
00:34:22.159 --> 00:34:25.159
Does my wife still have feelings for this scumbag?

669
00:34:25.159 --> 00:34:28.760
I never want to see him again.

670
00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:33.480
Take him to Antarctica.

671
00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:34.480
No, no, no.

672
00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:35.480
You're going to regret this Brian!

673
00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:36.480
Please!

674
00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:37.480
Let me go!

675
00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:57.519
Did you really stop drinking?

676
00:34:57.519 --> 00:35:02.480
Am I so stupid?

677
00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:05.789
I never suspected anything for three years.

678
00:35:05.789 --> 00:35:06.789
It's not your fault.

679
00:35:06.789 --> 00:35:07.789
It's my fault.

680
00:35:07.789 --> 00:35:09.789
I should have never left you alone.

681
00:35:09.789 --> 00:35:38.250
You're just going to leave me hanging?

682
00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:42.559
This should be enough to repay for your services tonight.

683
00:35:42.559 --> 00:35:43.719
Keep the change.

684
00:35:43.719 --> 00:35:44.719
Canada's a...

685
00:35:44.719 --> 00:35:46.429
Great.

686
00:35:46.429 --> 00:35:47.460
I don't want your money.

687
00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:50.250
I really like you.

688
00:35:50.250 --> 00:35:52.960
Well, I believe in the old saying.

689
00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:55.019
Wise men never fall in love.

690
00:35:55.019 --> 00:35:57.019
The feelings are vague.

691
00:35:57.019 --> 00:35:59.719
Money.

692
00:35:59.719 --> 00:36:06.670
Well, this...

693
00:36:06.670 --> 00:36:10.559
This isn't enough to buy me.

694
00:36:10.559 --> 00:36:18.489
Hey, charge that much, even if you're a hot CEO.

695
00:36:18.489 --> 00:36:19.519
Get out!

696
00:36:19.519 --> 00:36:20.519
No money for you.

697
00:36:20.519 --> 00:36:41.789
You don't want them to trust another man again.

698
00:36:41.789 --> 00:36:44.289
You don't have a series?

699
00:36:44.289 --> 00:36:47.059
That scammer, Jamie.

700
00:36:47.059 --> 00:37:08.960
My lady, what did Jamie do?

701
00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:15.719
I will take care of it.

702
00:37:15.719 --> 00:37:20.280
I'll make sure...

703
00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:21.980
Hello?

704
00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:27.820
How dare you upset my lady?

705
00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:30.519
I will not be intimidated.

706
00:37:30.519 --> 00:37:49.610
Even if these are richest men in the South.

707
00:37:49.610 --> 00:37:50.610
I'm sorry.

708
00:37:50.610 --> 00:37:53.989
Even if you're unbelievable.

709
00:37:53.989 --> 00:37:55.369
That lady is upset.

710
00:37:55.369 --> 00:37:58.369
He's out here hoping that we're trash and white men.

711
00:37:58.369 --> 00:38:16.590
Mr. Baratheon?

712
00:38:16.590 --> 00:38:19.550
Mr. Stark!

713
00:38:19.550 --> 00:38:23.059
What a coincidence.

714
00:38:23.059 --> 00:38:31.489
Mr. Baratheon?

715
00:38:31.489 --> 00:38:32.489
Mr. Stark.

716
00:38:32.489 --> 00:38:33.750
What a coincidence.

717
00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:35.750
What are you doing with that?

718
00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:44.599
My work is stressful, and I like to unwind by recycling bottles.

719
00:38:44.599 --> 00:38:47.599
What are you doing here all along?

720
00:38:47.599 --> 00:38:49.599
And who is that woman?

721
00:38:49.599 --> 00:38:51.699
You just got married and you're out having an affair?

722
00:38:51.699 --> 00:38:52.699
It's my wife.

723
00:38:52.699 --> 00:38:53.699
She kicked me out.

724
00:38:53.699 --> 00:38:56.699
She said our relationship is a romantic scam.

725
00:38:56.699 --> 00:38:58.920
Oh, a romantic scam.

726
00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:01.920
Look, my feelings for her are genuine.

727
00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:04.500
For some reason she doesn't believe me.

728
00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:05.719
How do you feel about her?

729
00:39:05.719 --> 00:39:12.000
Look, I've seen a lot of women when you attracted to her.

730
00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.409
What if she asked for dessert?

731
00:39:15.409 --> 00:39:16.409
I don't know.

732
00:39:16.409 --> 00:39:19.409
I buy her every dessert store in the city.

733
00:39:19.409 --> 00:39:23.409
So she could have a dessert every single day.

734
00:39:23.409 --> 00:39:25.409
What if she says it's too hot in the summer?

735
00:39:25.409 --> 00:39:28.409
We'll go on vacation to the North Pole.

736
00:39:28.409 --> 00:39:30.409
What if she says it's too cold in the winter?

737
00:39:30.409 --> 00:39:32.409
We'll buy her a tropical island.

738
00:39:32.409 --> 00:39:34.409
What if she asked for the stars?

739
00:39:34.409 --> 00:39:35.409
The stars?

740
00:39:35.409 --> 00:39:42.280
I don't know what if I could do anything about the stars.

741
00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:48.340
But I'll invest in NASA in as soon as possible.

742
00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:50.880
I'll take her to Mars.

743
00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:51.880
Mars?

744
00:39:51.880 --> 00:40:06.480
Mr. Stark, I can see that you truly care about Breanne.

745
00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:11.320
Perhaps I can give you some advice.

746
00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:12.760
Maybe.

747
00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:18.400
Just maybe Breanne is pushing you away because that asshole broke her heart.

748
00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:21.469
Stick around.
