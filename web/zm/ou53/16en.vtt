00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:22.339
I'm not signing any papers. I don't want to.

2
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.120
You want to kill me?

3
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.149
Grandma, don't get so mad.

4
00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:31.149
Hey, look, I can't forgive.

5
00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:32.149
It's rough.

6
00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:35.630
I'm so sorry I'm late, Grandma.

7
00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.990
Melody, so you are the gift.

8
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:41.990
And your justive time.

9
00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.490
Talk some sense into Jamie.

10
00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:49.640
Jamie, we grew up together.

11
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.640
You know that I would be a good wife.

12
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.219
Not some lowly delivery girl.

13
00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.719
I barely know her.

14
00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.070
I mean, Melody.

15
00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.070
Shut your foul mouth or you can see yourself out.

16
00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.129
I will not allow this.

17
00:01:06.129 --> 00:01:09.629
She's a broke trailer park trash.

18
00:01:09.629 --> 00:01:14.629
And she has contributed anything of any value to our family.

19
00:01:14.629 --> 00:01:17.659
What are you so stubborn?

20
00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:26.680
The only person who can call me names is my father.

21
00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.230
Since money seems to be the only thing that matters to you.

22
00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.230
Let me show you what real wealth looks like.

23
00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:42.079
In my collection of 18th century pearl necklaces, diamond cane, and rare facial cream from India that the Queen of England uses.
