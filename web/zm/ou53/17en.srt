1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,290
Oh, and this? This is just the tip of the iceberg.

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:07,799
I have a whole collection.

3
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:09,800
I think you're all just talk.

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,800
How do we know that these aren't things?

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,800
Well, if you think they're fake,

6
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,800
why don't you have your uncle examine them?

7
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:27,899
These pearls are exquisite.

8
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:29,899
The texture is silky,

9
00:00:29,899 --> 00:00:31,899
the translucence is divine.

10
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,899
These pearls are priceless.

11
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:37,750
The cut of this diamond,

12
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,750
is impeccable.

13
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,750
It's top quality, and this cream.

14
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:47,380
I've heard of it, but I've never used it.

15
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:52,380
Three years ago, the doctor I hired to treat Breanne was the only one who manufactured this facial cream.

16
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:56,380
How come she has this? Maybe she's really...

17
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:59,380
So what if it's real? Maybe it's Jamie's money.

18
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:02,380
Stannis, she didn't use my money to buy this.

19
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:04,379
And even if she did, she's my wife.

20
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:07,379
She can use my money, however she wants to.

21
00:01:07,379 --> 00:01:10,379
I can't control how she spends money.

22
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:13,379
But random weird products, she's giving us gifts.

23
00:01:13,379 --> 00:01:15,379
What if it kills grandma?

24
00:01:15,379 --> 00:01:21,540
Grandma, how can a selfish bitch like Breanne be a good?

25
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,730
She's right.

26
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:29,730
Even if the diamonds and the pearls are real,

27
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:33,730
she's still just a sly, trailer trash woman.

28
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:38,079
And if you insist upon staying married,

29
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,079
then you must hand over your cigarette ring.

30
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:43,079
Mother, what do you mean?

31
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:49,109
Well, pre-end can't be the head of our family's wife if they don't get a divorce,

32
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:56,109
then someone else must step up to be in charge of the family.

33
00:01:56,109 --> 00:02:00,109
And I wonder who you think would be worthy enough to be my wife.
