00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.879
And I wonder who you think would be worthy enough to be my wife.

2
00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:11.400
Your parents left you the ring in their will, but usually it goes to the eldest son.

3
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:18.199
So now that you have dishonored our family, I think that Stannis should take over.

4
00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:19.760
Rightfully.

5
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.079
That's right.

6
00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:28.179
To save the honor of our family, I guess I have no choice.

7
00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:30.260
I agree.

8
00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.060
As the eldest, Stannis should be the rightful heir.

9
00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.740
And my parents would have given it to Stannis if he was even capable.

10
00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.179
Even if I stepped aside, you couldn't handle it.

11
00:00:42.179 --> 00:00:44.130
He can't.

12
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:45.719
What about me?

13
00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.560
Jamie, you're a cruel traitor.

14
00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:48.640
I hate your guts.

15
00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.240
If you would have just apologized, I would have forgiven you.

16
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.710
But now it's too late.

17
00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.340
Cruel traitor?

18
00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:59.340
You betrayed her?

19
00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.549
Melanie, shut your mouth.

20
00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:04.750
We've never been together, and I've never led you on.

21
00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:05.750
She's lying.

22
00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.519
You embarrassed me, but you're a corruptist.

23
00:01:10.519 --> 00:01:11.959
Barys, come in.
