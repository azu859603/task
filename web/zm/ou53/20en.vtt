00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.209
Captain, honor us to the captain.

2
00:00:03.209 --> 00:00:06.209
Varys, my useless nephew,

3
00:00:06.209 --> 00:00:09.210
has relied on his parents to get to where he is today.

4
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.210
He's nothing.

5
00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:11.210
SHUT UP!

6
00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:12.210
You fool!

7
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.210
The captain from the Golden Corps will give us 17.

8
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.399
His entire net worth is more than the Stark family.

9
00:00:19.399 --> 00:00:23.399
What? No way! He's the captain of the Golden Corps?

10
00:00:23.399 --> 00:00:24.399
I... I...

11
00:00:24.399 --> 00:00:26.399
He's the captain.

12
00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:28.399
He's the captain.

13
00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:32.719
Dad said that's the only person his agent ability is on par with me.

14
00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:38.100
Jayvie, why didn't you ever tell us that you were the captain?

15
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.100
That's obvious, Grandma.

16
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.100
He founded the Golden Corps.

17
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.100
Family means nothing to him, I'm sure.

18
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.100
I should be the lead of the family. I'm the eldest son.

19
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:56.490
Jayvie, did you embezzle family money to fund the Golden Corps?

20
00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:03.420
Then the Golden Corps is part of the rightful property of Stannis.

21
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.420
You always had your favorites, Grandma.

22
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.420
The captain founded the Corps before he was head of the Stark family.

23
00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.420
This doesn't have anything to do with you.

24
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.180
Oh.

25
00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.180
You're a stupid old hag.

26
00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.280
I bet you don't even know that Stannis and Melanie are poisoning you.

27
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.590
What did you say?
