1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:02,140
I know how to test it.

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:03,140
How?

3
00:00:07,669 --> 00:00:10,669
Why don't we use it on your face?

4
00:00:10,669 --> 00:00:19,539
Now that it's Dennis, don't bother.

5
00:00:19,539 --> 00:00:22,539
Grandma! Grandma!

6
00:00:22,539 --> 00:00:24,539
I knew you'd believe in us!

7
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:26,539
Oh, thank you, Grandma!

8
00:00:26,539 --> 00:00:31,539
Nellany, you told me this product was edible, right?

9
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:37,780
Dennis, make her eat it!

10
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:47,939
You!

11
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:52,420
Bitch!

12
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:53,420
Doctor!

13
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,420
Doctor!

14
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,509
Doctor!

15
00:00:56,509 --> 00:00:57,509
Doctor!

16
00:00:57,509 --> 00:01:29,269
There's nothing we can do.

17
00:01:29,269 --> 00:01:32,269
I loved it with all my art and soul.

18
00:01:32,269 --> 00:01:34,840
Been poisoning.

19
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:41,599
Wonderful crap.

20
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:47,400
No.

21
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,400
Mom.

22
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,170
It's the poison and the shock.

23
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:53,230
Oh my God.

24
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:56,099
I'm gonna call the ambulance.

25
00:01:56,099 --> 00:01:59,099
Jamie, you're not the head of the Stark family.

26
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:10,189
You didn't expect it to go like this.

27
00:02:10,189 --> 00:02:11,189
Congratulations.

28
00:02:11,189 --> 00:02:16,020
You got rid of two heartless backstabbers.

29
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,780
They were my family.

30
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,620
We don't do a respect, Captain.

31
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:25,099
You have been too kind to reach us.

32
00:02:25,099 --> 00:02:27,099
No doubt, but maybe in the future.

33
00:02:27,099 --> 00:02:29,349
Cut to the chase.

34
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:31,419
Please, they've ordered Captain.

35
00:02:31,419 --> 00:02:33,419
Please, the boards are Captain.
