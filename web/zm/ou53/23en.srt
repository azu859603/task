1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,839
Varys, you're basically begging me to banish you to the rainforest.

2
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:09,400
Captain, Varys, Miss Brienne is our captain's perfect match.

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,519
She's kind, beautiful, and honorable.

4
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:13,919
Stay out of this.

5
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:17,719
Even if that's all true, she's just a deliberate girl.

6
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:20,160
She's a what-the-of the captain.

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,359
Whether she's worthy or not is not up for you to decide.

8
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:24,719
Please, everyone, sir, Captain!

9
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:26,000
Please, divorce her, Captain.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,280
Varys, are you trying to make my decisions for me?

11
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,640
Captain, but this woman...

12
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,640
Stupid!

13
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,280
You're so stupid.

14
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:39,670
With your recklessness and your responsibility, sooner or later, the Targaryens will bankrupt

15
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:40,670
you.

16
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:42,630
Why do you care about this wedding anyway?

17
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:44,590
Who are you, the state government?

18
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:49,030
Listen, not only are we not going to get divorced, we're going to have the most grand

19
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:50,030
wedding.

20
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:51,829
Captain.

21
00:00:51,829 --> 00:00:53,659
Oh, no, don't worry.

22
00:00:53,659 --> 00:00:55,820
You'll definitely be on the guest list.

23
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:59,380
Because I want to prove to you whether I'm worthy of Jamie or not.
