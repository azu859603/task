1
00:00:03,089 --> 00:00:15,970
Not quite.

2
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:20,019
Still feeling in love?

3
00:00:20,019 --> 00:00:21,019
I'm a little warm.

4
00:00:21,019 --> 00:00:24,210
Maybe the drug hasn't worn off yet?

5
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,690
Maybe we can, you know, again?

6
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:28,690
Stop it.

7
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:30,780
You're completely fine now.

8
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,780
Better than fine, actually.

9
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:36,850
Besides, um, I told you I have to go meet my dad to deliver our wedding invitations today.

10
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:38,850
I'm already running late.

11
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:39,979
Wait.

12
00:00:39,979 --> 00:00:42,979
You've been married for a while, and I still haven't met your father.

13
00:00:42,979 --> 00:00:43,979
I'll come with.

14
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:44,979
No, no, no.

15
00:00:44,979 --> 00:00:48,159
You made him at the wedding?

16
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:50,159
Besides, I want to try on wedding dresses.

17
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:52,159
And you can't see it before the ceremony.

18
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:54,929
I want it to be a surprise.

19
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:55,929
Alright then.
