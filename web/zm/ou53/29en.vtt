1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I'll do anything you ask if you help me get back into my waiting.

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.179
That bag is only $800,000.

3
00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:13.529
Buy it for me, then consider it.

4
00:00:13.529 --> 00:00:16.530
So I'm so hard to get here from the North Pole.

5
00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.530
If Lady Targaryen helps me, I can have my revenge.

6
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.359
He bought it?

7
00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:25.359
Guess I'll pretend to be Lady Targaryen just once.

8
00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:29.519
I can donate my kidney to your dad for $800,000.

9
00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.530
Excuse me, Ness. What are you taking, Ness?

10
00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.799
What do you say, my lady?

11
00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:45.520
I can't wait to paint this wedding, Rad.

12
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.520
Consider the wedding crimson.

13
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:59.159
Ladies and gentlemen, here is our bride.

14
00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:04.640
Miss Bran, do you take Mr. Jamie's hand in marriage?

15
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:05.640
I do.

16
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.700
I object.

17
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.939
I object.

18
00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:15.069
The series!

19
00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:18.379
Checked this wedding.

20
00:01:18.379 --> 00:01:20.510
Why is this mad man here?

21
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.510
Great, draw him out.

22
00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.510
Touch me if you dare.

23
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:25.829
Tick.

24
00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:27.060
Tick.

25
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.060
Go!

26
00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.900
Yeah.

27
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.189
That's pretty big.

28
00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:35.989
Bring it.

29
00:01:35.989 --> 00:01:36.989
You traitor!

30
00:01:36.989 --> 00:01:40.730
You bankrupt me and threw me out to sea.

31
00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:42.730
You know I can't swim. I almost drowned.

32
00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.340
You were too merciful, weren't you?

33
00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.340
You should have time to a rock.

34
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.340
Guess I was too kind, darling.

35
00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:49.340
Don't start flirting here.

36
00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.340
I could blow up everyone in your pieces.

37
00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.340
Are you crazy? All of my men are here.

38
00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:56.340
Hmm.

39
00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.530
I'm not here to love you.

40
00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.530
The Starks have nothing on Lady Targaryen.

41
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.969
Me?

42
00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.450
Lady Targaryen!

43
00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:19.300
Isn't the groom that hot guy I couldn't sleep with?

44
00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.300
I've got to have him this time.

45
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.300
The woman from the hotel?

46
00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.300
I won't let her ruin my wedding with Brienne.

47
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.300
She wanted to sleep with my man, and now she's impersonating me?

48
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.300
Greetings to you all.

49
00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.430
I am Lady Targaryen.

50
00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.430
Targaryens have half of the world's wealth.

51
00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.430
Compared to the Starks, they're just minions.

52
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.430
Well, that is true.

53
00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.430
She's not Lady Targaryen.

54
00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.430
How are you still going on with this Targaryen act?

55
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.430
Are you serious? I looked into it.

56
00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.430
She's the real deal.

57
00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.430
You're nothing but a trailer trash.

58
00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:54.430
Bitch!

59
00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.430
Do not disrespect our wait.

60
00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.849
Who's talking?

61
00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:00.849
I'll blow everyone in here!

62
00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:01.849
Wait!

63
00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:03.849
No one needs to die on my wedding day.

64
00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:04.849
You want money?

65
00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:05.849
Fine.

66
00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:06.849
You can have it.

67
00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:07.849
No.

68
00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:09.169
No.

69
00:03:09.169 --> 00:03:10.169
My man will be here soon.

70
00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:13.099
I want to see how far he can go.

71
00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:16.099
He's still talking shit, huh?

72
00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:17.099
Whoop!

73
00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:19.099
Have fun getting married now!

74
00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:21.020
Wait!

75
00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.560
I have a better idea.

76
00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.659
Get your ex in hell.

77
00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:28.659
In the groom.

78
00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:30.659
You can stay in heaven with me.

79
00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:32.009
Jaime!

80
00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:35.009
Why don't you marry me instead?

81
00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:38.009
I'll make sure the rest of your life is beyond comfort.

82
00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:40.039
Fuck it.

83
00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:42.039
Even a one night stand with him is worth it.

84
00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:44.039
You know I can tell you're lying?

85
00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:46.039
I can see it in your eyes.

86
00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:48.039
Even if you are Lady Targaryen,

87
00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:50.039
I'm not going to betray my wife.

88
00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:52.039
Just for that one.

89
00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:53.039
Captain!

90
00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:58.400
Please marry Lady Targaryen.

91
00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:04.620
Please marry Lady Targaryen.

92
00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.219
Fairies?

93
00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:08.639
Captain!

94
00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:10.639
Only Lady Targaryen is worth your view.

95
00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:12.699
How can you marry this trash?

96
00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:15.250
For Jaime, you'll see me.

97
00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.629
But I am Lady Targaryen.

98
00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:19.629
You have been with your captain.

99
00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:23.360
You liar?

100
00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.360
Jaime is the captain of the Golden Corps.

101
00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.550
But still, he's got nothing on Lady Targaryen.

102
00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.810
I still have the upper hand.

103
00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:32.810
He's the captain?

104
00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.810
I'll be rich if he's mine.

105
00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.810
How could you marry this trashy nobody?

106
00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.839
I'm perfect for you.

107
00:04:39.839 --> 00:04:41.839
You're such an imposter.

108
00:04:41.839 --> 00:04:44.899
You know, I know that you want my man and my identity.

109
00:04:45.899 --> 00:04:49.220
But maybe in the next life, you could be a Targaryen.

110
00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:50.220
Imposter.

111
00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.220
Me?

112
00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:56.310
The Targaryens run the world.

113
00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.310
And your man is mine too.

114
00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.949
Brie, don't listen to her.

115
00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:04.949
You're the only one that matters to me.

116
00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:08.550
I like the little competition,

117
00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.550
especially for my handsome man.

118
00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.610
Whoa!

119
00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.610
Lady, we're here to kill them, not one to four boys.

120
00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:17.610
Shut up.

121
00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:19.019
That's enough!

122
00:05:19.019 --> 00:05:21.060
Lady Targaryen,

123
00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.060
this is your last chance to leave with this scumbag

124
00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.060
or else you'll pay the price.

125
00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.060
It seems like she actually loves you.

126
00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.310
If I pair well enough, I'm sure she'll leave.

127
00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.310
Really?

128
00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:34.699
Yeah.

129
00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:37.529
I dare you to say that again.

130
00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:44.459
You.

131
00:05:44.459 --> 00:05:45.459
It's over.

132
00:05:45.459 --> 00:05:47.459
She's the real Lady Targaryen.

133
00:05:47.459 --> 00:05:50.459
But it seems no one here knows it.

134
00:05:50.459 --> 00:05:54.480
You're just Tyrion's lover.

135
00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.480
How dare you talk back to me?

136
00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.480
Your Tyrion's lover?

137
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.579
Tyrion must have sent you to fool the captain.

138
00:06:02.579 --> 00:06:07.910
How did you get to be second in command?

139
00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:09.170
You're so wrong.

140
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:11.170
Varys, I know Brienne better than anyone.

141
00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:13.170
Those are just rumors.

142
00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:16.170
Captain, this woman is not good enough for you.

143
00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:20.100
No, you're place, Varys.

144
00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:24.899
My Lady, please help us.

145
00:06:24.899 --> 00:06:26.899
Please get rid of this bitch.

146
00:06:26.899 --> 00:06:32.600
If we killed Lady Targaryen and blamed it on the Golden Corps,

147
00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:36.600
maybe I'll inherit the Duke's fortune as his only adopted daughter.

148
00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.600
Golden Corps.

149
00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.660
You can do anything.

150
00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:49.139
The Targaryens will back you up.

151
00:06:49.139 --> 00:07:00.209
Kilbran is my gift for Captain.

152
00:07:00.209 --> 00:07:03.240
It's a sacred sword that frees souls.

153
00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:07.240
If you really love Captain, kill yourself with it.

154
00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.240
And set Captain free.

155
00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:14.660
Oh, I see.

156
00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:21.860
You all want me to kill myself.

157
00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:22.860
I know!

158
00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:36.920
My Lady, what are you doing with that sword?

159
00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:38.920
You do not have to kill yourself at your own wedding.

160
00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:42.689
You're doing this later, I rushed here with gifts.

161
00:07:42.689 --> 00:07:43.689
Looks so good with my outfit?

162
00:07:43.689 --> 00:07:45.689
I mean, come on, I'll ride with the sword.

163
00:07:45.689 --> 00:07:47.980
Cool, right?

164
00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:49.980
My Lady, they want you dead.

165
00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:52.490
I'm tied for jokes.

166
00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:57.740
Come on, I'll know the truth.

167
00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:00.019
Did you listen?

168
00:08:00.019 --> 00:08:01.019
This is the great Lady Targaryen.

169
00:08:01.019 --> 00:08:03.019
How dare you try to kill her?

170
00:08:03.019 --> 00:08:06.050
You are Lady Targaryen.

171
00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:07.050
No way.

172
00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:11.790
Lady Targaryen?

173
00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:14.920
It's about a woman just now as a foster member.

174
00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:18.920
She's too natural to be a foster, right?

175
00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:20.920
Mr. Baratheon, you told us before.

176
00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:22.920
She's just a delivery girl.

177
00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:24.920
There's no way she could be a Targaryener.

178
00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:28.009
This must be a lie.

179
00:08:28.009 --> 00:08:30.360
How dare you to towards my Lady's name?

180
00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:33.970
I will not spare you, even if you're from the Golden Corps.

181
00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:38.669
Mr. Baratheon, I know I saw you that day with Bran.

182
00:08:38.669 --> 00:08:40.669
She's your lover!

183
00:08:46.919 --> 00:08:51.179
Mr. Baratheon, so she nearly is his lover, right?

184
00:08:51.179 --> 00:08:52.179
Slut.

185
00:08:52.179 --> 00:08:55.179
She hooked up with the richest man in the North.

186
00:08:55.179 --> 00:08:58.200
Bend this up.

187
00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.200
Oh!

188
00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.200
See?

189
00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:01.779
Her name is already dark.

190
00:09:01.779 --> 00:09:03.779
Brienne, the fucking slut.

191
00:09:03.779 --> 00:09:06.379
But serious!

192
00:09:06.379 --> 00:09:08.379
I was too easy on you before.

193
00:09:08.379 --> 00:09:13.419
I should have sent you to hell.

194
00:09:13.419 --> 00:09:14.419
I have a Targaryen.

195
00:09:14.419 --> 00:09:21.289
Show me what you got!

196
00:09:21.289 --> 00:09:48.019
What are you doing?

197
00:09:48.019 --> 00:09:50.049
I'm glad you're finally here.

198
00:09:50.049 --> 00:09:51.049
Greetings, my lord.

199
00:09:51.049 --> 00:10:01.120
Sir, say, what are you doing here?

200
00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:06.480
I...

201
00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:09.600
So, you're Jamie.

202
00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:16.620
Not bad.

203
00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:17.620
You are a tin.

204
00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:21.070
And I hear you're the captain of the Golden Corps.

205
00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:22.710
That's right.

206
00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:26.929
Or you're a perfect match for my daughter.

207
00:10:26.929 --> 00:10:29.250
She does have a good honor.

208
00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:30.279
Forget it.

209
00:10:30.279 --> 00:10:32.279
I'm not marrying your daughter.

210
00:10:32.279 --> 00:10:34.279
I already have a wife.

211
00:10:34.279 --> 00:10:35.279
And I love her.

212
00:10:35.279 --> 00:10:38.490
What do you say?

213
00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:43.440
Duke Targaryen, look at me.

214
00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:46.850
I'm the series.

215
00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:48.850
I'm head over heels alone with your daughter.

216
00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:55.169
We're a perfect match.

217
00:10:55.169 --> 00:11:01.240
Someone send this scum to the North Pole.

218
00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:04.240
Someone send this scum off to the North Pole.

219
00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:09.820
Get back up.

220
00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:10.820
What are you doing?

221
00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:16.600
Lady Targaryen.

222
00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:18.340
No, I stole my kidney.

223
00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:20.340
You gave me that bag after everything we've been through.

224
00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:21.340
You can't do this thing.

225
00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:26.539
No, I need my deal with what you're talking about.

226
00:11:26.539 --> 00:11:29.120
Get lost.

227
00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:32.889
I knew you were crazy.

228
00:11:32.889 --> 00:11:35.919
Luckily, this bomb is fake.

229
00:11:35.919 --> 00:11:40.220
Or else you'd have gotten me killed.

230
00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:41.220
Please get rid of him.

231
00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:43.220
Please, and I'll leave too.

232
00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:52.149
Lady Targaryen, you want to marry our captain, right?

233
00:11:52.149 --> 00:11:55.149
So why are you leaving when Duke Targaryen gets here?

234
00:11:55.149 --> 00:11:58.149
You can marry our captain, right here, right now.

235
00:11:58.149 --> 00:11:59.149
Barry's.

236
00:11:59.149 --> 00:12:02.149
I've had enough of you off to the North Pole.

237
00:12:02.149 --> 00:12:03.149
The captain.

238
00:12:03.149 --> 00:12:04.539
Hold up.

239
00:12:04.539 --> 00:12:06.539
So they are mistaken.

240
00:12:06.539 --> 00:12:08.860
A little brat.

241
00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:09.860
Let me test you.

242
00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:16.230
So, somebody has been bullying my daughter behind my back.

243
00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:20.419
And Jamie, you don't like my daughter.

244
00:12:20.419 --> 00:12:24.600
Duke Targaryen, I'll do respect.

245
00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:29.080
I'm not going to betray my wife just to marry your daughter.

246
00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:31.080
If you're offended, I understand.

247
00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:34.080
The Golden Core and I will accept the consequences.

248
00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:46.169
You can't stop teasing him.

249
00:12:46.169 --> 00:12:48.899
Dad?

250
00:12:48.899 --> 00:12:52.210
Dad?

251
00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:58.820
Jamie, let me introduce you to your father-in-law.

252
00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:00.820
Duke Targaryen.

253
00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:01.820
Yes.

254
00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:03.820
That Targaryen family.

255
00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:06.779
So you're a Targaryen?

256
00:13:06.779 --> 00:13:09.419
No, they told you like a million.

257
00:13:09.419 --> 00:13:11.190
You didn't believe?

258
00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:16.159
No, no!

259
00:13:16.159 --> 00:13:18.759
This did not!

260
00:13:18.759 --> 00:13:21.330
Oh, God.

261
00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:23.330
Jamie, my son-in-law.

262
00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:25.740
It looks like you really love, Brianna.

263
00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:29.480
And it makes me feel good that you'll be by her side.

264
00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:31.669
I'll always be by her side.

265
00:13:31.669 --> 00:13:37.019
And you.

266
00:13:37.019 --> 00:13:40.019
I graciously chose to sponsor you.

267
00:13:40.019 --> 00:13:42.019
Yet you poses my daughter.

268
00:13:42.019 --> 00:13:43.019
This is my daughter.

269
00:13:43.019 --> 00:13:44.019
I can't believe it.

270
00:13:44.019 --> 00:13:47.019
Duke Targaryen, please, please spare me.

271
00:13:47.019 --> 00:13:49.019
I won't have to be sent.

272
00:13:49.019 --> 00:13:53.450
No.

273
00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:55.450
How do you choose to punish her?

274
00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:56.539
Baby girl?

275
00:13:56.539 --> 00:14:14.220
She should be sent to the North Pole.

276
00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:18.970
Many years.

277
00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:26.909
Yes, my lady.

278
00:14:26.909 --> 00:14:28.909
Duke Targaryen, please, please, please.

279
00:14:28.909 --> 00:14:30.909
You can't send me back to the North Pole.

280
00:14:30.909 --> 00:14:31.909
I was there before.

281
00:14:31.909 --> 00:14:32.909
I was drowned.

282
00:14:32.909 --> 00:14:33.909
They didn't have any money.

283
00:14:33.909 --> 00:14:34.909
I didn't know what to do with my stuff!

284
00:14:34.909 --> 00:14:36.649
You're serious!

285
00:14:36.649 --> 00:14:46.360
Dad, I'll deal with him.

286
00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:48.360
You don't want to go back to the North Pole?

287
00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:49.970
Let's just start.

288
00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:50.970
Please.

289
00:14:50.970 --> 00:14:53.000
I'm so sorry.

290
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.000
Just spare me.

291
00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.220
Bran.

292
00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:58.340
Throw him in a volcano.

293
00:14:58.340 --> 00:14:59.340
Yes, sir.

294
00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:02.559
There's no fucking way.

295
00:15:02.559 --> 00:15:04.559
I've had that fucking North Pole!

296
00:15:04.559 --> 00:15:10.940
Captain.

297
00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:12.350
My lady.

298
00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:14.669
My apologies.

299
00:15:14.669 --> 00:15:15.669
I was blind.

300
00:15:15.669 --> 00:15:18.669
And I tarnished the lady's name.

301
00:15:18.669 --> 00:15:20.669
I'll send myself to the North Pole.

302
00:15:20.669 --> 00:15:23.669
And make sure the Golden Corps thrives there.

303
00:15:23.669 --> 00:15:25.799
And I won't come back.

304
00:15:25.799 --> 00:15:26.799
One of those.

305
00:15:26.799 --> 00:15:27.799
Kill on me?

306
00:15:27.799 --> 00:15:28.799
Good.

307
00:15:28.799 --> 00:15:29.799
Go now.

308
00:15:29.799 --> 00:15:37.169
Bran.

309
00:15:37.169 --> 00:15:43.320
Bran Targaryen.

310
00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:49.320
Do you take Jaime Stark as your lawfully wedded husband to be in love with him for the rest of your life?

311
00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:50.320
I do.

312
00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:51.320
Jaime Stark.

313
00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:56.519
Do you take Bran?

314
00:15:56.519 --> 00:15:57.519
I do.

315
00:15:57.519 --> 00:15:59.549
You may kiss her bride.
