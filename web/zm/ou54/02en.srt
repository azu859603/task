1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,589
Doris very nice to see you very Christmas

2
00:00:05,379 --> 00:00:07,379
Yeah, and a chit chat here

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:10,820
Sign the divorce pay

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:17,440
The look came all this business with us. Do you really have to do the sound spend Christmas with us?

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,760
Oh, we don't need his company

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,719
We'd be so much happier if you were around

7
00:00:24,629 --> 00:00:26,629
Doris enough mom

8
00:00:26,629 --> 00:00:31,140
Stop being so mean to him. I want to force you

9
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:39,039
We just asked Andrew here so that you help us get her gets to me. You are so naive

10
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:47,240
Mary the loser who can't even earn a dime and here you have a wealthy and handsome suitor right here

11
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,840
And we're still living with this loser

12
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:52,740
the suitor

13
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:54,179
chairman

14
00:00:54,179 --> 00:01:02,539
Andrew is the R&D director of the Ravenham autoclad and his father is the deputy

15
00:01:04,659 --> 00:01:10,719
Manager and if you hadn't come along Caroline would be married to him and she'd be a rich wife

16
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:23,480
Come on doors. I know you're right, but let's not take it hard on the court. What's the matter boy?

17
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,260
You got a problem with me?

18
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:32,540
No, I just want you to stay away from my wife and for four

19
00:01:33,379 --> 00:01:37,579
I don't think you know what you're talking about. Oh, what else could you be?

20
00:01:38,019 --> 00:01:40,540
And you can't even afford a car

21
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:44,859
And here you are telling Andrew to keep his distance from Caroline

22
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,540
He's just stopped talking

23
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,379
I'm speaking the truth

24
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,099
Philip

25
00:01:54,099 --> 00:01:56,140
You can't even afford

26
00:01:57,019 --> 00:01:59,420
You'll never have something like that your whole life

27
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:05,819
You're right. I would never have a problem. At least you know your place. Yeah, this is the chief

28
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:14,979
Porsche, right? Yeah, I didn't even make it in last year's international auto Expo. Yeah, I would I would never ever

29
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,620
buy a car
