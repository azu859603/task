1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:06,849
Even your jokes are terrible. Do you really think you could afford one? Do you have that kind of money?

2
00:00:06,849 --> 00:00:12,849
An international auto expo. Even though what it is, that's where the real elite's gathered.

3
00:00:12,849 --> 00:00:15,849
And you'd think you'd be invited.

4
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:22,850
Actually, yes. I attended for the first time this year, and I've been invited almost every single year, but I'm just busy.

5
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:26,850
Oh! They've been invited every year.

6
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:30,850
Let me guess, and then the governor invited you to this party.

7
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:34,850
Are you talking about Henry? Yeah, Henry didn't have a party this year.

8
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:40,009
Unbelievable! This guy is such a clown.

9
00:00:40,009 --> 00:00:44,170
Huh? Do you think it's a move done without a fear to us?

10
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:49,640
Okay. Caroline, there is a lot of Queen Caroline.

11
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,770
And I will tell you this.

12
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:56,280
Okay. I don't have time for this nonsense, Caroline.

13
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,280
The president of the Horton Group has just arrived and read them now.

14
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,380
I must help my father prepare the welcome bank. Bye, Doris.

15
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:12,799
This is all your fault. Now, Andrew's upset. Why can't you just let Caroline be with Andrew?

16
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:22,700
Mom, let's go and solve. Dad's waiting. I'm sorry. Mom's a bit hot-tempered.

17
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,409
I will always be both sides.

18
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:34,150
You have waited for me for three years, and I am forever grateful for that.

19
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:37,790
I just want you to know that wherever you are,

20
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:44,180
I will always be by your side. Thank you.

21
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:48,930
I missed you too.

22
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:52,430
I'm glad you're back.

23
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:53,430
Me too.

24
00:01:53,430 --> 00:02:00,829
Hey, Demi.

25
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:03,930
Oh, my God. Caroline. You'll never guess how this happened.

26
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:09,539
I just saw the president of the Horton Group. He's so young. Red Sue Harrison.

27
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:12,539
He was like, I saw him love it.
