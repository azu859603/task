1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,480
It's my best friend. I'll introduce you guys later. She's the shining star of the alphabet.

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:06,459
Okay.

3
00:00:06,459 --> 00:00:08,880
I'm excited to watch it this time.

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,240
Alright.

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:16,109
He's a...

6
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:17,410
That charmin, huh?

7
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:19,410
He's totally my type.

8
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:23,910
Oh, by the way, Caroline, please help me pick out a sis-lum-trow.

9
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:28,440
I must capture our young hot president's eyes at the welcome dinner tonight.

10
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,640
You got it, girl.

11
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:40,670
Tonight, you are a special baby boy.

12
00:00:40,670 --> 00:01:00,679
Hey, Caroline, your mom lost husband and finally made it back.

13
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:03,179
Heidi, you know, Philip was just working out of time.

14
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:05,680
Oh, good for him.

15
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,680
I was afraid we'd see him on the news,

16
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,680
where I'm having a bank or getting a little rested.

17
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,680
Heidi, thank you very much for your concern.

18
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,810
Alright, alright. Heidi is just messing around.

19
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:21,870
Philip, you have any gifts for us?

20
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:33,310
Yes, Nick, go ahead and pick whichever one of you would like.

21
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:39,310
Looks like plastic broaches, some wine from a fake vineyard and cheap ceramics

22
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:41,310
that won't even sell for ten bucks.

23
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:45,810
Caroline here, are you sure your man isn't going to trick on us?
