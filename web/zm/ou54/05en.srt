1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:04,230
You know that for let's just the viewer talk time. I'm sure he had to pick

2
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:06,589
I know Caroline actually

3
00:00:06,969 --> 00:00:12,669
These are some really expensive items, especially the wine is actually from a vineyard called tri-a vineyard

4
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:18,109
Vineyard is a top-notch vineyard

5
00:00:19,149 --> 00:00:21,870
And he says Paul vineyard

6
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:26,530
Never heard of Paul's vineyard. It's probably some roadside dump

7
00:00:27,089 --> 00:00:33,530
Might not even be safe for the drink. Actually Heidi Hall's vineyard was their old name

8
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:39,929
And this is actually a very rare wine. It's actually from their last batch something that money can't buy

9
00:00:40,329 --> 00:00:42,829
To be honest stop making up stories

10
00:00:43,729 --> 00:00:45,729
I've been drinking pry a wine for years

11
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:48,289
They've never changed their name

12
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:52,329
Even if these gifts aren't worth much, it's a big quote. We appreciate them

13
00:00:53,329 --> 00:00:55,329
Thank you Caroline. You're very sweet

14
00:00:56,539 --> 00:01:00,659
Let's use the wine for cooking and prawn the broaches and ceramics

15
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:07,019
There's something going on at Kesso's trading thrift store where junk like this can maybe sell them ten bucks

16
00:01:07,019 --> 00:01:09,019
Now that is a good idea

17
00:01:09,459 --> 00:01:12,340
You actually might be able to turn a profit on all this now

18
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:15,340
Heidi you've always been the brains of the family

19
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:20,969
You know the ignorance at this table is really starting to get to me now if mr.

20
00:01:20,969 --> 00:01:25,730
Draven was here who'd be owner of that vineyard to be able to tell you the value of these items immediately

21
00:01:26,209 --> 00:01:29,909
You clown are you insulting us? No

22
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:36,260
I am not strictly just telling you the facts now if mr. Draven was here

23
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:40,420
He'd probably be making you guys all crying and apologizing to me
