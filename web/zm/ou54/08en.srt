00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:05,500
Hey kid. What are you doing here? Should be home for Christmas?

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:06,500
You work here?

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:11,189
Yeah. I'm headed the inspection department.

4
00:00:11,189 --> 00:00:17,190
My uncle gave me this note. She said I could pick out her car and get the toy model that comes with it.

5
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:22,190
Oh boy. I want to sleep pranks. But I was just as useless as...

6
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:23,190
Oh my god.

7
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:25,960
Is this real?

8
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,960
This has the one who's present signature on it.

9
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,379
Mr. Can I make my thunderblade 9x now?

10
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:34,539
Uh, sure. Funny woman.

11
00:00:34,539 --> 00:00:38,869
Philip. What's the deal here?

12
00:00:38,869 --> 00:00:43,159
I try to get you a job and you throw it in my face.

13
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:48,159
Someone like you should show some respect to the Bob and what I've lost.

14
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:51,600
Philip, listen.

15
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,600
If you care so much about your so-called dignity, then getting a job, you're the biggest fool in the world.

16
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,090
Mom, Dad, look!

17
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:05,760
Did you really get the same car?

18
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,760
In the real thunderblade 9x.

19
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,760
Mr. Ian drove it over for me.

20
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,760
A real thunderblade 9x.

21
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,760
Come, let's see.

22
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:34,200
Is this not good for you?

23
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,189
Mr.
