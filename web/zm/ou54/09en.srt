1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,339
That's a limited edition phantom, because at least eight figures in them.

2
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:07,000
Am I dreaming?

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,199
This is real, right?

4
00:00:08,199 --> 00:00:12,699
I mean, there's literally no way that they'll manage to get that power.

5
00:00:12,699 --> 00:00:14,900
This is unbelievable.

6
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:17,300
Mike, where did you get it?

7
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:20,500
I didn't mystery him in this snow, like this.

8
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,500
He took me to take out the car.

9
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,899
He told me the signature on it was really important.

10
00:00:25,899 --> 00:00:27,500
Signature?

11
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,500
What signature?

12
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,500
Can I see the note?

13
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:30,500
Sure.

14
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,500
Can I go to my room, play with my new thunderblade night next now?

15
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,500
Yeah, of course, buddy.

16
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,719
Oh my God.

17
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:39,640
I get it now.

18
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,640
I know exactly how Mike got the con.

19
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,640
What kind of dirty trick thought was playing here?

20
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,640
Oh my God.

21
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,640
What are you talking about?

22
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,640
He's a damn fraud.

23
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,899
Nick, if you know something you should just tell us.

24
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:53,899
The key is the signature.

25
00:00:53,899 --> 00:00:58,060
You forged the warring group's executive signature.

26
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,060
Didn't you?

27
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,060
Didn't you?

28
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:04,060
You tripped that man into giving Mike the car.

29
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:05,090
Oh.

30
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:08,090
So you can just whip up a fake signature like that?

31
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:10,090
It's clearly not your first time.

32
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:14,310
You're a connoisse.

33
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:16,310
You are a piece of trash.

34
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:17,310
Oh my God.

35
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,310
Guys, hold on.

36
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:20,310
There's got to be some kind of misunderstanding.

37
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:21,310
Right?
