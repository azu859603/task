1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,700
Caroline, don't you get it?

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:06,360
Your husband's Philip, he is a fraud.

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:07,860
No.

4
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:11,140
No, guys, I don't believe that Philip would do something like this.

5
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:13,960
Well, thank you for your trust, Caroline.

6
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:18,129
You know, I hate to say this to you all, but you're over home.

7
00:00:18,129 --> 00:00:19,289
Wrong.

8
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:21,649
What could we possibly hear all about?

9
00:00:21,649 --> 00:00:22,129
Hm?

10
00:00:22,129 --> 00:00:24,649
Explain that damn signature.

11
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:25,890
Well, I'm actually.

12
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:28,289
Caroline, I'm back.

13
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:29,530
It's Andrew.

14
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,129
He's back from his work.

15
00:00:31,129 --> 00:00:33,250
Let's deal with Philip's issues later.

16
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:37,380
We don't want to embarrass ourselves in front of Andrew.

17
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:42,179
Doris, I have some great news for you.

18
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:44,539
I've heard that Barra, the plant manager,

19
00:00:44,539 --> 00:00:48,060
is coming by to wish you all a Merry Christmas, too.

20
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:49,219
You are truly blessed.

21
00:00:49,219 --> 00:00:51,780
Everyone is showing you guys so much love.

22
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,340
That's great.

23
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:57,380
Sure is lively out there.

24
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:00,939
I had to cut my physical therapy session short.

25
00:01:00,939 --> 00:01:02,700
So I could join you guys.

26
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:06,700
Draven, perfect timing.

27
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:07,579
This is Andrew.

28
00:01:07,579 --> 00:01:11,700
He's the deputy director of the Ravenham Auto Plant.

29
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,260
He's spending Christmas with us.

30
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,379
This is the new Hansel and Beyond Man.

31
00:01:15,379 --> 00:01:16,219
I enjoy that.

32
00:01:16,219 --> 00:01:17,780
This gift is for you, Draven.

33
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:20,099
Oh, I've got you a diamond watch.

34
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:21,459
OK, thank you.

35
00:01:21,459 --> 00:01:27,510
And a top tier bottle of warring for you, baby.

36
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:31,230
Andrew, how did you know Freya wines were my fav?

37
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:36,659
Look, yes, Andrew is always a generous person,

38
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:42,379
whereas some people bring us junk to ruin the holidays.

39
00:01:42,379 --> 00:01:44,420
Doris, whether you believe he or not,

40
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:46,140
the struct world is good stuff.

41
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,969
This can't even cover half of what I've got.
