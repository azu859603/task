00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.530
Idiot. You keep trying to sell us all this junk. We're not buying any more of your friends.

2
00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:15.490
Hey Elmo. Man, you deserve an Oscar. A broke guy like you trying to act rich in front of me.

3
00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.870
I just don't know how to help out. What makes you so confident?

4
00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:29.899
See what I mean? Look at this moron. My father is the vice president of Raven Ham Otto.

5
00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:34.899
I am the direct head of R&D. In case you don't know what that is, it's researching development.

6
00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:40.899
That factory is the lifeline of this town. I am confident because everyone respects us.

7
00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:46.929
Wow. Not bad. See, you think you're funny. You won't be laughing for long.

8
00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:52.929
Don't? You will apologize to Andrew or no one will be able to save you.

9
00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:58.929
You know Doris, I hate to say this. Because if you want to help this man, you'll have him.

10
00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.340
Apologize to me. Are you insane?

11
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:09.340
You've got to death with disrespecting Andrew. You know, you got some nerve.

12
00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:15.340
I think it's time to teach you a lesson. Mr. and Mrs. Baker, I apologize to the fans with this respect.

13
00:01:21.099 --> 00:01:26.099
If you and your daddy want you to get a rating in on them, you're going to fucking apologize to me right now. You fucking got it.

14
00:01:26.099 --> 00:01:39.969
First off, please, Philip. Philip didn't mean any disrespect. Please just let him go. Don't hurt him.

15
00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:47.959
I'm calling my security right now. They'll teach you a lesson.

16
00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:57.530
No. Enough. We're here to spend Christmas together. Let's have something to eat.

17
00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.560
Anyone who is not hungry can get up and lean.

18
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:18.110
Grandpa's right. Grandpa's right. This was just a huge misunderstanding. Let's just let's all call down and let's go have Christmas dinner.

19
00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.659
You have got to stop saying crazy things. Listen. I'm worried about you.

20
00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:26.580
I know. I'm sorry.

21
00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:52.289
Oh, Draven. Try this wine as the top tier vintage from Freya Vangers. It's been 20 minutes. He can get it out myself.

22
00:02:52.289 --> 00:03:05.599
This is an excellent wine. Oh my God. Andrew is the best. Each bottle of Freya Vinger cost $100,000.

23
00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:23.379
This is a rare treat indeed. Thank you so much for sharing with us, Andrew. Oh my God. This taste.

24
00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:27.379
Grandpa, what's wrong? What did you add to this sauce?

25
00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:31.580
Uh, just some cheap wine that Philip brought.

26
00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:37.300
Are you insane? Do you realize what you've done?

27
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.780
Oh, what the hell?

28
00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.319
This is probably one of the wine.

29
00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:49.860
Oh my God. I knew we should have thrown away this cheap stuff. We're probably all going to get food poisoning.

30
00:03:49.860 --> 00:04:00.719
Stop. This is a rare vintage from Freya Vignards.

31
00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:09.879
I had this 20 years ago at the governor's house. It's an unforgettable taste. I would recognize it anywhere.

32
00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:16.879
But how is this possible? Draven, that bottle said whole vineyards, not Freya.

33
00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:22.879
This is from their century old vineyard. One bottle costs a million dollars.

34
00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:31.879
The president would have a hard time to get access to this wine. And what did you do to add the sauce?

35
00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:41.129
What? What about all the other stuff that Philip brought?

36
00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:43.449
Bring them to me now.

37
00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:53.209
I signed the donation agreement already and they wired me ten bucks. They're coming to pick it up next week.

38
00:04:53.209 --> 00:05:04.959
This approach is made of pure diamonds. That alone makes it priceless. The craftsmanship alone.

39
00:05:04.959 --> 00:05:16.170
And this porcelain. This porcelain, I've only seen it once before.

40
00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:23.170
And it was in the private collection of a corporate CEO. It belongs in a museum.

41
00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:26.170
Did Philip give all of this to you?

42
00:05:32.899 --> 00:05:38.149
I knew he was the best, but how can he afford all of these?

43
00:05:38.149 --> 00:05:40.310
Oh, my head.

44
00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:42.110
Grandpa?

45
00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:43.110
Caroline.

46
00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:51.470
Could you please take me up to my room? I'm feeling faint.

47
00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:52.470
I've been weak.

48
00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:53.470
I'm feeling weak.

49
00:05:53.470 --> 00:06:02.579
As much as possible, how could you have the money to buy such expensive gifts?

50
00:06:02.579 --> 00:06:05.899
You know, Dora, I'm really happy that you're starting to realize that.

51
00:06:05.899 --> 00:06:08.899
And so don't believe that you could afford this.

52
00:06:08.899 --> 00:06:10.899
How did you manage to get these?

53
00:06:10.899 --> 00:06:14.540
Wait, did you? Did you steal these?

54
00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:15.540
Nick!

55
00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:18.379
I'm saying that it's insulting.

56
00:06:18.379 --> 00:06:19.379
Could Caroline.

57
00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:20.379
Caroline.

58
00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:23.850
Do not listen to this guy's shit.

59
00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:26.139
Hold on, everybody.

60
00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:32.990
I just realized that brush looks really familiar.

61
00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:37.990
The plant manager at Ravenham Auto, Pharaoh, she had a brush just like that.

62
00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:44.439
And she was going to have Joseph give it to the president of the Horton Group.

63
00:06:44.439 --> 00:06:45.439
Give me the brush.

64
00:06:45.439 --> 00:06:46.439
I'm going to fix it.

65
00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:54.660
I'm going to fix it and fix it and fix it and see.

66
00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:56.660
That is the brush that you have prepared.

67
00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:05.350
Which means that Philip is going to stole the gift from the present of the Horton Group.

68
00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:06.350
Oh, you scum.

69
00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:09.500
I should have known.

70
00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:11.500
You are such a scumbag.

71
00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:14.500
I should have known I can't believe you did this.

72
00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:15.500
You idiot.

73
00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:18.500
If Pharaoh finds out we are done for.

74
00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:19.500
You filthy thief.

75
00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:21.500
Why don't you just tire him?

76
00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:29.850
Did he really steal the brush from Pharah?

77
00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:32.189
Wait.

78
00:07:32.189 --> 00:07:33.189
Listen.

79
00:07:33.189 --> 00:07:34.480
You guys.

80
00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.480
You got it all wrong.

81
00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:37.480
Yeah.

82
00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:38.480
No.

83
00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:42.339
That is definitely the brush that Pharaoh prepared.

84
00:07:42.339 --> 00:07:43.339
Caroline.

85
00:07:43.339 --> 00:07:45.339
Why are you still defending him?

86
00:07:45.339 --> 00:07:48.339
This filthy guy has been lying to you.

87
00:07:48.339 --> 00:07:49.339
Okay.

88
00:07:49.339 --> 00:07:50.339
Enough.

89
00:07:50.339 --> 00:07:51.339
All right.

90
00:07:51.339 --> 00:07:52.339
Listen.

91
00:07:52.339 --> 00:07:58.339
I have not received the chance to reveal myself and you're going to treat me like this at a family dinner?

92
00:07:58.339 --> 00:07:59.339
That's ridiculous.

93
00:07:59.339 --> 00:08:00.339
Still acting?

94
00:08:00.339 --> 00:08:01.339
What are you?

95
00:08:01.339 --> 00:08:03.339
The president of the Horton Group?

96
00:08:03.339 --> 00:08:09.720
Heroines.

97
00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:13.699
You stole the view.

98
00:08:13.699 --> 00:08:16.339
I have never cared about the money.

99
00:08:16.339 --> 00:08:18.339
It has never been about that.

100
00:08:18.339 --> 00:08:19.339
Hold on a second.

101
00:08:19.339 --> 00:08:21.339
No, but I can't stand the thought of you lying and stealing.

102
00:08:21.339 --> 00:08:22.339
Tell me this isn't true.

103
00:08:22.339 --> 00:08:23.339
You're really good.

104
00:08:23.339 --> 00:08:25.370
They're lying.

105
00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:28.980
If you can't be honest with me, then maybe it is better that we get it for us.

106
00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:29.980
No.

107
00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:30.980
Listen.

108
00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:31.980
No.

109
00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:32.980
I can't hear.

110
00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:33.980
Do you find out the truth about me?

111
00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:35.039
I'm not lying.

112
00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:36.039
You need to force me.

113
00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:39.419
You've nothing but nonsense since you got here.

114
00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:41.419
What I'm telling you to do.

115
00:08:41.419 --> 00:08:49.649
Oh my god.

116
00:08:49.649 --> 00:08:55.309
We cannot let miss you and see this thing with those gifts.

117
00:08:55.309 --> 00:08:58.570
We will never be able to explain it.

118
00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:00.570
Get him out of here.

119
00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:01.570
Now.

120
00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:03.570
Take him out through the back door.

121
00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:04.570
Caroline.

122
00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:05.570
You can believe me.

123
00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:07.570
When you find out who I am, who you do.

124
00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:08.570
Shut up.

125
00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:09.570
Shut up.

126
00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:10.950
Go.

127
00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:22.210
Christmas music, you wig.

128
00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:26.250
Thank you.

129
00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:29.649
Caroline.

130
00:09:29.649 --> 00:09:32.649
I had exciting news for you.

131
00:09:32.649 --> 00:09:34.649
Thanks to a very concerned gentleman.

132
00:09:34.649 --> 00:09:40.649
You have just been promoted head of public relations of Ravenham, all of you.

133
00:09:40.649 --> 00:09:48.059
That's really surprising.

134
00:09:48.059 --> 00:09:50.090
No need to be a modest Caroline.

135
00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:52.090
You're very deserving of this.

136
00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:58.440
And as for the gentleman who's been looking out for you and who helped you get this.

137
00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:59.440
Well.

138
00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:00.440
We all know who that is.

139
00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:02.429
Oh, hey.

140
00:10:02.429 --> 00:10:03.429
Awesome.

141
00:10:03.429 --> 00:10:04.429
Thank you.

142
00:10:04.429 --> 00:10:05.500
I'm honored.

143
00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:07.500
Thank you so much.

144
00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:09.500
I only mentioned Caroline's name.

145
00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:12.500
I didn't know that you would promote her so soon.

146
00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:13.500
Thank you for your trust and support.

147
00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:15.500
We won't let you down.

148
00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:16.500
No way.

149
00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:17.500
Oh, Andrew.

150
00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:19.500
Thank you so much.

151
00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:22.500
You are the shining star, the bigger family.

152
00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:25.500
Thank you.

153
00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:26.500
Thank you, Andrew.

154
00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:31.710
I'm just, I'm not sure that I'm comfortable with this.

155
00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:32.710
No Caroline.

156
00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:35.710
You are the most deserving person for this position.

157
00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:39.799
Actually, I've been needing to ask you.

158
00:10:39.799 --> 00:10:43.799
Where is your husband, Mr. Edwards?

159
00:10:43.799 --> 00:10:51.700
You know, Philip, you know him?

160
00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:53.279
Of course.

161
00:10:53.279 --> 00:10:55.279
You're so modest.

162
00:10:55.279 --> 00:10:58.279
I know you're Philip Edwards' wife.

163
00:10:58.279 --> 00:11:01.379
Just wondering why you never mentioned it before.

164
00:11:01.379 --> 00:11:07.720
I is Miss Ewing, so interested in Philip.

165
00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.720
What does she want with him?

166
00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:11.720
She must know that Philip stole the gift.

167
00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:12.720
She's nasty, guys.

168
00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:13.720
Dude, Philip!

169
00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:18.509
He's tracking his turn again.

170
00:11:18.509 --> 00:11:19.509
Oh.

171
00:11:19.509 --> 00:11:20.509
No.

172
00:11:20.509 --> 00:11:22.509
What is going on here?

173
00:11:22.509 --> 00:11:24.509
Where is Mr. Edwards?

174
00:11:24.509 --> 00:11:27.509
I thought he was coming here to have dinner with you tonight.

175
00:11:27.509 --> 00:11:28.509
No.

176
00:11:28.509 --> 00:11:29.509
No.

177
00:11:29.509 --> 00:11:31.509
Oh, Miss Ewing up your own.

178
00:11:31.509 --> 00:11:33.509
We don't know each other.

179
00:11:33.509 --> 00:11:35.509
Caroline is not married to him.

180
00:11:35.509 --> 00:11:36.509
What?

181
00:11:36.509 --> 00:11:38.509
Mom, what are you talking about?

182
00:11:38.509 --> 00:11:41.509
Caroline doesn't know any Philip.

183
00:11:41.509 --> 00:11:46.049
If Caroline had a husband, it would be Andrew.

184
00:11:46.049 --> 00:11:47.049
Andrew?

185
00:11:47.049 --> 00:11:48.980
Oh, yeah.

186
00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:51.980
Andrew is a big admirer of Caroline.

187
00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:55.980
If things go well, they'll be married very soon.

188
00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:56.980
Oh, yes.

189
00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:58.980
Miss Ewing.

190
00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:02.980
Andrew and Caroline, it is perfect couple.

191
00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:03.980
Oh, my God.

192
00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:05.980
Do you even know what you're talking about?

193
00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:09.980
Caroline is Mr. Edward White.

194
00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:11.980
And that I am sure are.

195
00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:22.409
Oh, um, we know that Philip stole the Christmas gifts.

196
00:12:22.409 --> 00:12:24.409
And Caroline is going to divorce him.

197
00:12:24.409 --> 00:12:28.409
And so we sent him off to the police station

198
00:12:28.409 --> 00:12:32.409
and we are gonna make sure he's dropping here.

199
00:12:32.409 --> 00:12:36.230
The police station?

200
00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:38.230
You sent him to the police?

201
00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:41.320
Oh, my God.

202
00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:49.669
This very Ewing seemed very upset.

203
00:12:49.669 --> 00:12:51.669
What did we do?

204
00:12:51.669 --> 00:12:52.669
I stole from her.

205
00:12:52.669 --> 00:12:55.700
Now she hates us too.

206
00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:59.700
God, Philip, he deserves a bullet in his fucking head.

207
00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:01.700
You know, my brother Waylon works at the police station.

208
00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:03.700
I already told him to teach that son of a bitch unless he.

209
00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:04.700
No.

210
00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:10.379
Mom, you shouldn't have said those things.

211
00:13:10.379 --> 00:13:14.370
I am married to Philip and I have nothing to do with Andrew.

212
00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:20.009
Why are you still defending that worthless husband?

213
00:13:20.009 --> 00:13:22.009
We are doing this for your future.

214
00:13:22.009 --> 00:13:25.009
You deserve a better man.

215
00:13:25.009 --> 00:13:26.009
Yeah.

216
00:13:26.009 --> 00:13:27.009
Caroline.

217
00:13:27.009 --> 00:13:29.169
Mother knows best.

218
00:13:29.169 --> 00:13:31.389
A thousand times better than that loser.

219
00:13:31.389 --> 00:13:33.389
Why don't you understand?

220
00:13:33.389 --> 00:13:35.779
I'm going to get Philip.

221
00:13:35.779 --> 00:13:40.100
Damn it.

222
00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:48.559
My brother Nick told me to make sure you got what's coming to you, Philip.

223
00:13:48.559 --> 00:13:51.779
Can you tell me how you steal such expensive items?

224
00:13:51.779 --> 00:13:54.980
From Miss Vara Ewing?

225
00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:56.980
I didn't steal anything.

226
00:13:56.980 --> 00:14:01.779
And you're going to have a lot of problems when you realize that you're holding me here without any evidence.

227
00:14:01.779 --> 00:14:04.779
You think I respect you because I'm being civil?

228
00:14:04.779 --> 00:14:07.779
You're a piece of trash.

229
00:14:07.779 --> 00:14:10.779
I could beat you to death and nothing will come out of it.

230
00:14:10.779 --> 00:14:11.779
Here.

231
00:14:11.779 --> 00:14:13.779
Sign this confessional.

232
00:14:13.779 --> 00:14:18.220
If you cooperate, I might let you go home for Christmas.

233
00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:23.870
And what if I refuse?

234
00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:31.980
You're going to make me get violent.

235
00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:38.370
It's Christmas, so don't blame me for not showing any family loyalty.

236
00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:42.850
I can kill you right here and nobody would care.

237
00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:49.100
One, going to give you one last chance because we're family.

238
00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:52.799
Put down the gun or you're going to face some consequences.

239
00:14:52.799 --> 00:14:53.799
You're not going to lie to me.

240
00:14:53.799 --> 00:14:55.799
Are you threatening me?

241
00:14:55.799 --> 00:15:00.529
Well, we have a problem outside.

242
00:15:00.529 --> 00:15:02.529
What is it? I'm here.

243
00:15:02.529 --> 00:15:03.529
Why are you shooting Burt?

244
00:15:03.529 --> 00:15:05.529
This is serious.

245
00:15:05.529 --> 00:15:07.529
Okay, spin it out. What is it?

246
00:15:07.529 --> 00:15:12.750
Ms. Farah Ewing, the president of Ravenham auto plants.

247
00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:14.750
She's outside. She's here.

248
00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:15.750
What?

249
00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:20.929
Let's go give her a warm welcome there.

250
00:15:20.929 --> 00:15:24.929
Ms. Ewing, what are you doing here on this fine holiday?

251
00:15:24.929 --> 00:15:26.929
What are you doing?

252
00:15:26.929 --> 00:15:32.929
This piece of trash is going to steal the presents if you prepare for the president.

253
00:15:32.929 --> 00:15:33.929
Don't worry.

254
00:15:33.929 --> 00:15:35.929
I was just about to get it out of him.

255
00:15:35.929 --> 00:15:39.929
He was denying it, but I'm about to teach him a lesson.

256
00:15:39.929 --> 00:15:41.929
He's got the balls to steal from you.

257
00:15:41.929 --> 00:15:43.990
I'll make a pay.

258
00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:54.620
Whalen, dude, I applaud your effort, but you better start thinking about how you're going to get on your hands and knees and beg me for mercy.

259
00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:56.620
You're still running your mouth.

260
00:15:56.620 --> 00:16:00.220
I can end you right here, cocksucker!

261
00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:04.220
Man, things are about to get a little messy.

262
00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:09.659
I suggest you wait outside so you don't have to see it.

263
00:16:09.659 --> 00:16:10.659
You idiot!

264
00:16:10.659 --> 00:16:13.850
Man, what was that for?

265
00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:15.850
You want to know why?

266
00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:20.299
You just disrespected the president of the Wharton group.

267
00:16:20.299 --> 00:16:22.299
I should put a bullet in your head.

268
00:16:22.299 --> 00:16:25.740
Him? He's the president?

269
00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:31.570
No, I told you that you were going to regret this. Do you remember that?

270
00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:38.570
Sir, I'm so sorry. I should have gotten here sooner. I'll make sure this is handled properly.

271
00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:44.570
You know, it was good that you got here late because I was able to witness these two dumbasses make a fool out of themselves.

272
00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:47.210
Or should I say?

273
00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:56.799
Mr. Ed, please forget me. Please, I'm sorry. I was too stupid to recognize who you were.

274
00:16:56.799 --> 00:16:58.799
For this sake of family!

275
00:16:58.799 --> 00:17:05.799
You want to talk about family now? You were just trying to put a gun to my head and shoot me, right?

276
00:17:06.799 --> 00:17:15.990
Please inform both these gentlemen's family that they're going to be going on a little business trip for a long time.

277
00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:17.700
Yes, sir.

278
00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:18.700
Wait!

279
00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:29.569
So look, Edwards? Cody, right?

280
00:17:29.569 --> 00:17:32.079
You're the Wharton group.

281
00:17:32.079 --> 00:17:35.079
Yes, sir. What are you doing out here near the police dishes?

282
00:17:35.079 --> 00:17:41.240
Ravenham Auto is applying for a $10 million project. I'm here to assess it.

283
00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:48.240
I heard that you were arrested so I immediately came out to find out what was going on, and to basically ask,

284
00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:51.240
who had the audacity to disrespect you?

285
00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:54.240
Just a bunch of fools. Realize for me.

286
00:17:54.240 --> 00:18:02.240
Hey, I named you to listen to the investments at the auto plants, and I think there's some fools that are trying to get the best of us.

287
00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:06.240
Absolutely, sir. In fact, I've seen some discrepancies in the reports.

288
00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:13.240
I have a hunch, I have a feeling that that Bob, who's the Deputy Director, is moving funds out of the company.

289
00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:15.880
Deputy Director Bob. Yes.

290
00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:23.809
Cody, I want you to throw a Christmas party this afternoon, and I want you to invite Bob. I'm going to make a fool out of him.

291
00:18:23.809 --> 00:18:26.579
Can you do that?

292
00:18:26.579 --> 00:18:27.579
Absolutely, sir.

293
00:18:27.579 --> 00:19:14.859
Caroline!

294
00:19:14.859 --> 00:19:20.859
Carol, she skipped family gathering to come looking for me. God, she's still that adorable.

295
00:19:22.299 --> 00:19:24.299
What are you doing here? I thought you were getting a dress.

296
00:19:24.299 --> 00:19:27.299
I heard your husband stole something that was meant for the Wharton Group President.

297
00:19:27.299 --> 00:19:30.299
I can't believe this is happening. Carol, are you okay?

298
00:19:30.299 --> 00:19:35.329
Philip and I got into a fight, and I really regret it.

299
00:19:35.329 --> 00:19:40.329
I know they're saying that he stole something, but I just can't believe that, and I'm sure that there's an mistake.

300
00:19:40.329 --> 00:19:45.640
I just want you to know you deserve better.

301
00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:50.640
Look at the Wharton Group President. He bought his wife's such amazing guess.

302
00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:52.640
She must be over the moon.

303
00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:59.650
What the hell are you doing, buddy? You trying to get yourself killed?

304
00:19:59.650 --> 00:20:03.650
Philip, my old friend. How are you?

305
00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:04.650
Bowen!

306
00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:08.940
Very nice to see you. You know, you should be thankful that I didn't get hurt.

307
00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:10.940
You'd be the one that gets killed.

308
00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:11.940
Damn, Philip.

309
00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:15.940
I'm sure you got all those days in high school, but you know that doesn't mean shit now.

310
00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:18.940
One call from me, and you won't know it hit you.

311
00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:23.940
Oh, so you don't want to apologize now, and you're going to continue to act tough?

312
00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:25.940
Yeah. So what?

313
00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:30.940
I've got the money. I've got the power. I've got everything to beat.

314
00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:35.059
Look at you. So horrible today.

315
00:20:35.059 --> 00:20:37.059
Do you know who I am now?

316
00:20:37.059 --> 00:20:42.059
I'm the head mechanic at Ravenhand Auto Group, and I've got dozens of men working under me,

317
00:20:42.059 --> 00:20:47.059
and if you don't keep your mouth shut, well, I'll just have them beat you senseless.

318
00:20:47.059 --> 00:20:51.829
You know, from one small-town thug to another one.

319
00:20:51.829 --> 00:20:52.829
Impressive.

320
00:20:52.829 --> 00:20:55.019
Should I applaud you?

321
00:20:55.019 --> 00:21:00.420
Fuck you. You have no idea what's coming to you.

322
00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:07.720
What? The Christmas party tomorrow? Everyone's gone?

323
00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:08.720
Even Andrew?

324
00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:12.940
Perfect. I was planning on dropping Andrew's gifts off pretty soon.

325
00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:16.940
Yeah, I'm hoping he can give me the new contract for the new Auto Repair Project.

326
00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:19.940
They're applying for 10 million from the Wharton Group.

327
00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:27.750
Look. You're lucky. I have bigger sister.

328
00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:31.849
But next time I see you, you will be banking.

329
00:21:32.849 --> 00:21:38.420
CRM.

330
00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:47.240
Imagine how bad will it feel when I be from the boss's way, and you're still stuck with that loser.

331
00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:53.549
I know that your boss is like the best, but let's not forget that he's married, okay?

332
00:21:53.549 --> 00:21:58.549
He cares. Oh, by the way, did you hear the auto plant is hosting us this afternoon?

333
00:21:58.549 --> 00:22:02.549
Maybe the big boss will be there. You have to meet him.

334
00:22:02.549 --> 00:22:09.240
He's rich, handsome. He's got the whole package.

335
00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:12.240
Even if I don't meet him at the party, I will definitely see him at the bank, right?

336
00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:17.240
Okay. You're right. I'm just so hyped. I need to go pick out the dress. I'll see you later.

337
00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:18.430
Okay.

338
00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:24.720
Caroline, I'm out. You see? I told you. I didn't steal anything.

339
00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:27.720
And I am still the honorable man that you've found number.

340
00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:28.720
Are you hurt?

341
00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:30.390
No.

342
00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:34.390
If there did come to rescue you and bring the cops and make clear everything out.

343
00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:35.390
It's good.

344
00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:39.930
I'm not going to be happy if something like this happens again.

345
00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:48.900
I promise that I'm always going to stay by your side and I'm going to bring you in life.

346
00:22:48.900 --> 00:23:00.329
So, I'm in happiness, joy, and comfort. Okay.

347
00:23:00.329 --> 00:23:02.970
Let's go home. Yes. I'll get capitalist.

348
00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:17.789
So, I can introduce you. He's an old friend of mine. I'll ask him if you are a job.

349
00:23:17.789 --> 00:23:31.750
Cornell, actually, I don't really need end of discussion. Just do it.

350
00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:35.819
Cody. Oh, hi. I'll just go on through some files. I'll be at the party later.

351
00:23:35.819 --> 00:23:38.880
What's that? You coming to inspect us?

352
00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:42.940
Yes. I've reviewed the proposal you've submitted for the new project.

353
00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:47.069
We need to verify its viability before improving any funds.

354
00:23:47.069 --> 00:23:52.069
Oh, no problem. As it happens, we having us, uh, Christmas party this afternoon.

355
00:23:52.069 --> 00:23:55.069
And you're more than welcome to stop by and join us.

356
00:23:55.069 --> 00:24:01.609
Dad, the fact that Cody called you versus that affair, that says it all.

357
00:24:01.609 --> 00:24:04.609
The Horton Group values you more than her.

358
00:24:04.609 --> 00:24:09.609
Well, I've been with that factory for years and years and I've built a solid reputation.

359
00:24:09.609 --> 00:24:13.900
And, you know, Cody's just coming here to inspect us.

360
00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:19.019
And, uh, if the funds go through, we're looking at a billion dollars.

361
00:24:19.019 --> 00:24:23.599
A billion? Dad, we just gave them a hundred.

362
00:24:23.599 --> 00:24:27.789
I know what you're thinking, that's stopping. Ten million be just fine.

363
00:24:27.789 --> 00:24:31.779
Subtle. And I like it.

364
00:24:31.779 --> 00:24:35.779
And when you replace Paris, the auto plant manager, and I've become your deputy,

365
00:24:35.779 --> 00:24:39.779
will be in touch. No one in Ravenham will dare mess with us.

366
00:24:39.779 --> 00:24:48.619
Who is that? Oh, that's Cor now.

367
00:24:48.619 --> 00:24:52.619
We're all buddies. He keeps begging me to give his son a large job.

368
00:24:52.619 --> 00:24:54.619
It's, it's, it's, it's.

369
00:24:54.619 --> 00:24:59.130
What an idiot. He still hasn't ditched that loser.

370
00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:04.130
I mean, you think by now that he would realize that his daughter's not going to be happy with anyone from me.

371
00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:07.130
You still haven't won her over yet.

372
00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:10.150
It's just a matter of time, okay?

373
00:25:10.150 --> 00:25:13.150
Soon enough, she'll realize that her husband is nothing compared to me.

374
00:25:13.150 --> 00:25:17.150
Hey, you should get that with Cody. I want to hit some party, okay?

375
00:25:17.150 --> 00:25:24.779
Oh, look at that.

376
00:25:24.779 --> 00:25:29.779
Oh, babe, I have to take a phone call. I won't meet you in that.

377
00:25:29.779 --> 00:25:31.980
Two seconds. Two. Two.

378
00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:39.099
Cody. Yeah, hey, I'm at the party.

379
00:25:39.099 --> 00:25:43.099
I need you to look into the embezzlement of the auto group project.

380
00:25:43.099 --> 00:25:47.220
Can you do that for me?

381
00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:51.220
Yes, and, and listen, I also need, I'm going to need you to go

382
00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:54.250
through every single contract that had ever been brought.

383
00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:57.250
And there is a specific piece.

384
00:25:57.250 --> 00:25:58.920
They have life.

385
00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:01.940
Okay, all right.

386
00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:02.940
I'll, uh, for you guys.

387
00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:05.259
There's so many life.

388
00:26:05.259 --> 00:26:07.420
Hi! I love life.

389
00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:10.059
Hey, which one's life?

390
00:26:10.059 --> 00:26:13.980
Is there more? Oh, okay.

391
00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:14.980
Hold it.

392
00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:17.940
This ain't for you, you piece of shit.

393
00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:22.650
I'm sorry.

394
00:26:22.650 --> 00:26:23.650
Wouldn't you say?

395
00:26:23.650 --> 00:26:24.650
Are you deaf or something?

396
00:26:24.650 --> 00:26:27.650
I said this positive for Andrew, hands off.

397
00:26:27.650 --> 00:26:30.650
It is our company's party, the food should be different.

398
00:26:30.650 --> 00:26:31.650
That's not for you.

399
00:26:31.650 --> 00:26:34.650
You are sucking up to Andrew.

400
00:26:34.650 --> 00:26:35.650
Shut the hell up, buddy.

401
00:26:35.650 --> 00:26:37.650
Wayne's so Andrew gets you and puts you in your place.

402
00:26:37.650 --> 00:26:41.660
I don't got the answers.

403
00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:44.660
We are going to go read it, Andrew, for the gift right now.

404
00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:45.720
Okay?

405
00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:52.619
Don't touch the pie.

406
00:26:52.619 --> 00:26:54.619
Andrew, you're early.

407
00:26:54.619 --> 00:26:57.619
You shouldn't have opened your card, or you should have waited for me.

408
00:26:57.619 --> 00:26:58.619
Really diffs.

409
00:26:58.619 --> 00:27:02.259
I prepared, especially for you, these Christmas gifts.

410
00:27:02.259 --> 00:27:05.259
Plus a private lounge with some gourmet treats.

411
00:27:05.259 --> 00:27:07.670
Enjoyed the celebration?

412
00:27:07.670 --> 00:27:08.670
Yeah.

413
00:27:08.670 --> 00:27:18.599
Good job, boy.

414
00:27:18.599 --> 00:27:19.599
Why'd you come by yourself?

415
00:27:19.599 --> 00:27:21.599
I stopped by your place to pick you up.

416
00:27:21.599 --> 00:27:23.599
Oh, you did not mean to do that.

417
00:27:23.599 --> 00:27:25.140
Hey.

418
00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:27.430
I'm happy to do anything for you.

419
00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:31.329
You know, I think you should fucking watch yourself.

420
00:27:31.329 --> 00:27:32.710
Hello.

421
00:27:32.710 --> 00:27:35.480
You came with Caroline.

422
00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:38.480
This party is for our factory employees only.

423
00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:40.480
You don't even work here.

424
00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:46.380
Andrew, if Philip is my husband, family members are welcome.

425
00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:49.380
Even if they are, they are rules.

426
00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:52.380
He's so broke, he makes this place dirty just by being here.

427
00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:53.380
Andrew.

428
00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:54.380
What?

429
00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:55.380
Get lost.

430
00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:57.500
You don't belong at this Christmas party.

431
00:27:57.500 --> 00:27:58.500
You heard him?

432
00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:00.500
Andrew said...

433
00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:01.500
Ah!

434
00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:04.589
Ah, look at me!

435
00:28:04.589 --> 00:28:05.589
Bowen.

436
00:28:05.589 --> 00:28:06.589
Right?

437
00:28:06.589 --> 00:28:07.589
Yeah.

438
00:28:07.589 --> 00:28:08.589
It's Christmas.

439
00:28:08.589 --> 00:28:12.880
I don't think you want me to sit here and beat the fucking shit out of you.

440
00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:14.910
Just as I thought.

441
00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:17.069
You're a low-life thug.

442
00:28:17.069 --> 00:28:20.069
Philip, you're even worse than I gave you credit for.

443
00:28:20.069 --> 00:28:25.069
If it weren't for Caroline here and my respect for, I'd have you arrested.

444
00:28:25.069 --> 00:28:28.859
But you can leave now.

445
00:28:28.859 --> 00:28:30.930
I think you should leave.

446
00:28:30.930 --> 00:28:32.309
Me?

447
00:28:32.309 --> 00:28:33.309
Please?

448
00:28:33.309 --> 00:28:34.309
Okay.

449
00:28:34.309 --> 00:28:36.440
So maybe you forgot.

450
00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:38.440
This is the Ravenham auto plant.

451
00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:41.440
I am the head of R&D and my father is the vice president.

452
00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:42.440
Let's see.

453
00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:43.440
Did I forget anything?

454
00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:44.440
Oh, yes.

455
00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:45.700
You're a thief.

456
00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:47.700
And nobody wants you around.

457
00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:53.730
What is going on?

458
00:28:53.730 --> 00:28:55.730
Caroline's husband is a thief.

459
00:28:55.730 --> 00:28:58.730
If Andrew said so, it must be true.

460
00:28:58.730 --> 00:29:00.759
Just look at him.

461
00:29:00.759 --> 00:29:02.759
He looks shady as hell.

462
00:29:02.759 --> 00:29:03.759
Gross.

463
00:29:03.759 --> 00:29:04.980
Hold on, everyone.

464
00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:05.980
Sorry.

465
00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:06.980
There had been a mistake.

466
00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:07.980
Caroline.

467
00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:08.980
Caroline.

468
00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:09.980
I know your kind.

469
00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:12.980
But stop trying to protect the thief of a husband.

470
00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:13.980
Exactly.

471
00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:15.019
Caroline.

472
00:29:15.019 --> 00:29:17.180
You know what we all saw.

473
00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:19.180
How could it be a mistake?

474
00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:21.180
Quit trying to defend him.

475
00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:24.240
I would love to know what you saw.

476
00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:25.240
Let's see.

477
00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:27.240
It was a million dollar bottle of champagne.

478
00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:29.240
An expensive fruit.

479
00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:34.240
And a porcelain dish that you couldn't possibly afford unless of course you won the lottery.

480
00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:37.240
But we all know that didn't happen.

481
00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:40.240
You know, I'm really starting to feel sorry for you.

482
00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:43.240
So if there's anything you want at this park.

483
00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:44.460
Just name it.

484
00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:47.910
You can take it home and consider this charity.

485
00:29:47.910 --> 00:29:52.559
Say it again.

486
00:29:52.559 --> 00:29:54.559
Let him go, you son of a bitch.

487
00:29:54.559 --> 00:29:55.559
It's okay, Bowen.

488
00:29:55.559 --> 00:29:56.690
I got it.

489
00:29:56.690 --> 00:29:59.009
Do you want to hit me?

490
00:29:59.009 --> 00:30:00.519
You're pathetic.

491
00:30:00.519 --> 00:30:03.710
You're just a thief and a beggar.

492
00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:05.509
Yeah, I said it.

493
00:30:05.509 --> 00:30:06.509
Now what?

494
00:30:06.509 --> 00:30:07.509
Andrew.

495
00:30:07.509 --> 00:30:08.509
Andrew.

496
00:30:08.509 --> 00:30:09.509
If you didn't want us here.

497
00:30:09.509 --> 00:30:10.509
You could have told us not to come.

498
00:30:10.509 --> 00:30:12.509
There is no need to be so nasty.

499
00:30:12.509 --> 00:30:13.509
So look, we don't want to be here.

500
00:30:13.509 --> 00:30:14.509
Anyone.

501
00:30:14.509 --> 00:30:18.359
Just go.

502
00:30:18.359 --> 00:30:19.359
You know, you all are a bunch.

503
00:30:19.359 --> 00:30:20.359
But to be here.

504
00:30:20.359 --> 00:30:22.390
To be walking around here like your king.

505
00:30:22.390 --> 00:30:23.390
Something.

506
00:30:23.390 --> 00:30:25.390
Trouble's coming your way.

507
00:30:25.390 --> 00:30:31.029
Thank you, sir.

508
00:30:31.029 --> 00:30:32.029
Cool.

509
00:30:32.029 --> 00:30:33.029
You're finally here.

510
00:30:33.029 --> 00:30:35.029
Bob, great to see you.

511
00:30:35.029 --> 00:30:38.250
Bob, great to see you.

512
00:30:38.250 --> 00:30:41.500
From the way he's talking, this project is a done deal.

513
00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:44.500
If I can land it, I'll be the hero of the planet.

514
00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:49.630
With Wharton Group backing me up, I'll finally take over as a plant manager.

515
00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:50.630
Absolutely.

516
00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:51.630
Right this way.

517
00:30:51.630 --> 00:30:54.940
Me apologize?

518
00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:57.940
I've never seen someone so stupid.

519
00:30:57.940 --> 00:30:59.940
You're going to be the one apologizing.

520
00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:00.940
My father gets here.

521
00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:02.940
He's going to have you on your knees begging for me.

522
00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:05.009
You and your father don't mean shit to me.

523
00:31:05.009 --> 00:31:07.009
Keep my father's name on children.

524
00:31:07.009 --> 00:31:08.009
You, Idi.

525
00:31:08.009 --> 00:31:11.009
You have no idea what Bob Smith means to Ravenham.

526
00:31:11.009 --> 00:31:12.009
You're a dead man walking.

527
00:31:12.009 --> 00:31:13.009
What's up?

528
00:31:13.009 --> 00:31:15.009
Do you want me to take a good job?

529
00:31:15.009 --> 00:31:18.009
Thanks for reminding me Caroline.

530
00:31:18.009 --> 00:31:20.779
Your husband's a joke.

531
00:31:20.779 --> 00:31:24.700
It's Christmas and he asked Daddy to get him a job.

532
00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:26.700
Ha ha ha ha.

533
00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:29.089
Phil, you're such an embarrassment.

534
00:31:29.089 --> 00:31:33.980
You know, if I told you what I'd do, you'd piss yourself.

535
00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:36.170
I piss myself.

536
00:31:36.170 --> 00:31:38.740
Are you serious?

537
00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:39.740
You have symptoms.

538
00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:41.740
I'm going to give you one last joke.

539
00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:43.740
You get on your hands and you'll apologize.

540
00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:44.740
Go ahead.
