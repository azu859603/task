1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
No, how could you hit me?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
You okay?

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,669
Did you play the hero of now?

4
00:00:05,669 --> 00:00:07,669
Let's see if you're full of shit.

5
00:00:07,669 --> 00:00:08,669
No!

6
00:00:08,669 --> 00:00:09,669
No!

7
00:00:09,669 --> 00:00:13,669
I swear, if you hurt Mr. Edwards, you won't see it tomorrow.

8
00:00:13,669 --> 00:00:16,670
What the fuck are you thinking you can talk to me like that?

9
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:17,670
You want to die to that too?

10
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:18,670
Go fuck yourself!

11
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:20,670
Andrew, put the gun down now.

12
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:21,670
Dad, what are you doing here?

13
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:23,670
You're supposed to be meeting with the manager from the horses.

14
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:26,670
Now, the manager of the horses is right here in front of you, idiot!

15
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:28,670
Now, you apologize, Mr. Brown.

16
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:31,179
Mr. Brown!

17
00:00:31,179 --> 00:00:34,179
I'm so sorry, I just lost my head for a second.

18
00:00:34,179 --> 00:00:36,179
It was his fault!

19
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:37,179
He was making a scene.

20
00:00:37,179 --> 00:00:39,179
I was just trying to teach him a lesson.

21
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:40,179
No.

22
00:00:40,179 --> 00:00:42,179
Philip didn't do anything wrong.

23
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:43,179
They were harassing him.

24
00:00:43,179 --> 00:00:44,179
You calm down, Missy.

25
00:00:44,179 --> 00:00:46,179
Mr. Brown can judge for himself.

26
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:47,179
I'm so sorry, sir.

27
00:00:47,179 --> 00:00:49,179
I had this man thrown out right away.

28
00:00:49,179 --> 00:00:51,179
Cody, I've had it after this shit.

29
00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:53,179
Can you please take care of me?

30
00:00:53,179 --> 00:00:55,179
You lost your tone when you talked to Mr. Brown.

31
00:00:55,179 --> 00:00:56,179
Mmm.

32
00:00:56,179 --> 00:00:58,179
Philip's just upset.

33
00:00:58,179 --> 00:01:00,179
He really didn't mean any disrespect.

34
00:01:00,179 --> 00:01:01,179
You forgive him, sir.

35
00:01:01,179 --> 00:01:04,730
Missy, you don't have to apologize.

36
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:06,730
Save it, Caroline.

37
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:09,730
He isn't going to forgive your stupid-ass husband.

38
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:10,730
Oh, babe.

39
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:11,730
Don't you worry.

40
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:14,590
You don't have to take it much longer.

41
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:20,200
Miss, I'm not in any position to forgive Mr. Philip Edwards.

42
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,200
Whatever he wishes is my highest command.
