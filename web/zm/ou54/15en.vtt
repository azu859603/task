00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:09.619
The President? Sorry. You're saying that this man here, who looks homeless, is the President of the Wharton Group?

2
00:00:09.619 --> 00:00:10.619
That's impossible.

3
00:00:10.619 --> 00:00:14.830
You're all a bunch of idiots. Now I warned you.

4
00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:16.829
But you're going to learn your lessons today.

5
00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:18.829
Guards? Get them!

6
00:00:18.829 --> 00:00:21.829
No way the sick! You can't be the President of the Wharton Group.

7
00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:25.829
You can't be. This can't be happened. I refuse to believe it.

8
00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:27.829
You're a good man. You better believe that.

9
00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:29.829
Take them! No, no way!

10
00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:37.740
No, I didn't. That's where you were supposed to be on the Wharton Group. I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

11
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:43.740
And who I am doesn't matter. But what matters is that you've been using the auto-plants name to boss people around in that topic.

12
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.740
And you know what? You fucking ruined it and you've insulted Carolina.

13
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:51.740
I'm sorry, but I didn't mean to disrespect you Carolina. I apologize. Please forgive me.

14
00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.740
Well none of that matters now. Guess what? You have two options.

15
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:59.740
One, you're fired and we can send you to the cops and they can make you pay for all the consequences of the crime that you've committed.

16
00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.740
Or two, you can spend a little bit of quality time with my guys.

17
00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:10.739
No! We've already asked forgiveness. We said we were sorry. Please forgive us. Why don't you just let us go?

18
00:01:10.739 --> 00:01:18.219
Guys, take them to the dock. Kill the sun slowly and make sure the dad watches.

19
00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:21.609
And then after, I want you to kill him too.

20
00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:22.609
Dad, no.

21
00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:28.609
No, no, wait a second. I got it now! You're bullshit! You're not the real President of the Wharton Group.

22
00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:35.609
Andrew, what are you saying? I'm saying that Doris told me that he forged the President's signature at the auto-plant.

23
00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:38.609
And I just didn't realize how far this piece of shit would go.
