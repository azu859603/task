1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,040
But what are you talking about?

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:06,639
You all have no idea how twisted this guy really is and how low he's gotten.

3
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:09,839
He forged the President's signature opportunity to be someone he's not.

4
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:11,039
He's a con artist!

5
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:13,599
Dear God, you deserve that burning hell!

6
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:15,679
Cody, we know exactly who this guy is.

7
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:17,280
He's nothing but a filthy bum.

8
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,079
There's no way he's a big shot in the Wharton route.

9
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:21,280
He's been tricked.

10
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,280
You need to shut this instance!

11
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,039
Sir, I know it's all I do, sir, but he's a far not you.

12
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:29,760
I'll have my man take him to the police station right now.

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,640
No, not yet!

14
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,679
You low life, you've made me beg for mercy in front of all these people.

15
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:35,039
Now I'm going to take your bitch!

16
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:37,869
No, I'm going to get your bitch going right.

17
00:00:37,869 --> 00:00:38,909
I'm going to go with me.

18
00:00:38,909 --> 00:00:39,820
I'm going to go with you.

19
00:00:42,049 --> 00:00:44,049
Hey, we're just getting started.

20
00:00:44,049 --> 00:00:46,450
You can thank your husband for putting you in this mess.

21
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:49,969
You know, I'm going to give you one more chance to let go of you.

22
00:00:49,969 --> 00:00:54,369
I'm going to your little games so you just sit and watch as I screw your bitch right here,

23
00:00:54,369 --> 00:00:55,570
but I'm never buying you.

24
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:56,689
You know what?

25
00:00:56,689 --> 00:00:58,770
I think I changed my life.

26
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:02,189
I'll clean you out myself.
