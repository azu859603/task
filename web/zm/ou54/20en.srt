1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,540
What would she say?

2
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:07,000
Pharaoh's going to tear into this imposter and drag him in front of the real president for a proper punishment.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,560
What's so funny, Philip?

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:14,210
Fag me and I might put in a good word, but of course, Caroline would ask for mine.

5
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:16,010
Don't get it twisted.

6
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:19,500
I'm only laughing because you already got one for the grave.

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,500
What?

8
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,399
Don't worry, you don't have to understand what I'm saying.

9
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:24,199
Just start thinking about your last words.

10
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:25,760
Fuck you!

11
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,559
How about I break the nose and see how cocky you really are?

12
00:00:29,559 --> 00:00:31,660
Enough!

13
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:33,259
All you fuckers are dead.

14
00:00:33,259 --> 00:00:34,560
Shut up, boy!

15
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,560
You laid hands on my son.

16
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,359
I can all smug and shit.

17
00:00:38,359 --> 00:00:39,759
Congratulations, Philip.

18
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:41,960
You've officially pissed me off.

19
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,700
Save it, Dad.

20
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,119
I'll teach him a lesson right now.

21
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:53,039
First, I'll shoot him in his legs, then his arms, and then when he's suffered enough, I blow his fucking hand.

22
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,740
I can't take this anymore!

23
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:56,240
I'm gonna know I'm in the crowd.

24
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:00,439
You don't want someone finding out that you just took this imposter for the real president.

25
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:02,439
Who you still with this boy deserves?

26
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:04,200
You getting away?

27
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,200
That's right.

28
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,200
Getting away with my think you're in on.

29
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,200
Fucking motherfuckers is beyond fucking saving!

30
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,200
What's the matter, Philip?

31
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,200
Wasn't it you?

32
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,200
It just said, what were my last words?

33
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,290
Maybe it should be saying that lie.

34
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:22,290
Your stupidity never disappoints me, Andrew.

35
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,290
Still yapping away.

36
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:25,290
Goodbye, Philip.

37
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:28,799
Andrew, stop!
