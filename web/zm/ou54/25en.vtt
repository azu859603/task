00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.080
Kurt, wow, you are a real person.

2
00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.320
You know, I think you should cool it a little bit

3
00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:09.560
before you blow your chances at that promotion, right?

4
00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.240
How do you know about that?

5
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.480
Kurt don't listen to him.

6
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.480
Ever since he got back, he's been spewing nonsense

7
00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.000
like he was losing his mind.

8
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Well, that makes sense.

9
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.239
My reputation for seeing to me,

10
00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:25.280
even to someone like him,

11
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.879
everybody knows I'm the top candidate

12
00:00:26.879 --> 00:00:30.100
for the position in the finance department.

13
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.820
And Philip, the source has told me a lot about you.

14
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.780
Apparently you're a nobody.

15
00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.420
Ever since Caroline married you,

16
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.380
I haven't been able to make her happy.

17
00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.179
You know, you don't seem like the first person

18
00:00:40.179 --> 00:00:41.740
that's happy themselves.

19
00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:42.979
Let me tell you what happened.

20
00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:44.420
I don't need to tell her.

21
00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.780
Natalie, I'm not either.

22
00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.179
You don't deserve Caroline.

23
00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:49.619
And you do?

24
00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:50.939
Enough, Philip.

25
00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:52.340
You don't want to cross Kurt.

26
00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:53.859
Not even in his league.

27
00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:55.259
Exactly, Cornell gets it.

28
00:00:55.259 --> 00:00:56.420
You're not in my league.

29
00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.579
If you've had any sense, you would leave Caroline

30
00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.179
and take care of her.

31
00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:02.359
Kurt, it's Christmas.

32
00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:04.599
I think you should all get along here, right?

33
00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:10.430
Or, I can kick your fucking ass.

34
00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:11.909
You're gonna whoop my ass.

35
00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.069
You're a joke to me.

36
00:01:13.069 --> 00:01:17.319
I could crush you with one finger.

37
00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:20.379
You said I'm a bitch, slap me.

38
00:01:20.379 --> 00:01:21.219
I'm just sorry.

39
00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:22.420
You know, I think it was just like,

40
00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.939
your face just like did something to me.

41
00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:25.780
You know what?

42
00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.500
I think we should just get along from Ellen, don't you?

43
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.379
Philip, did you just hit him?
