1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:03,690
That is amazing!

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:08,679
We would be so delighted to go to the President's banquet.

3
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:10,679
It's my dream come true.

4
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:13,080
Kurt, my man, you've made my year.

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,679
Kurt, this is really sweet of you.

6
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:16,379
My parents have been dying to go for a while.

7
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:20,070
Thank you.

8
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,070
You want this mess?

9
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:21,570
Sure.

10
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:22,370
Yeah.

11
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:23,769
It's just one catch.

12
00:00:23,769 --> 00:00:26,370
Caroline needs to be my date to the banquet.

13
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:27,370
She'll go with me.

14
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:27,969
No.

15
00:00:27,969 --> 00:00:31,769
She will actually not go with you because she's my wife.

16
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:34,770
You know, if you're nobody, you're not even invited.

17
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,250
Kurt, this isn't right.

18
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,950
What is it right?

19
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:41,950
I mean, Philip can't go to the banquet anyway.

20
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:43,020
Doris.

21
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,020
I actually was invited.

22
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:48,020
And Caroline, I didn't mean to tell you something for a long time.

23
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:50,020
The thing is, is that I'm a...

24
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:52,020
Yes, you are a dumb ass.

25
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:58,020
You can't get in the banquet by just flashing that stupid little card.

26
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,590
Doris, you need to listen to me.

27
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:02,590
You...

28
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:03,619
Listen to me.

29
00:01:03,619 --> 00:01:08,980
Kurt is in the Wharton Group's finance department and is on goal.

30
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:10,980
He was the manager there.

31
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:15,980
It would be a privilege for Caroline to be his date.

32
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,980
And we would all be...
