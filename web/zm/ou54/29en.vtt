00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.199
Dylan test is talking to you. Are you deaf? No, I'm not deaf actually, but you do owe me money for my dry cleaning now

2
00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:14.839
Typical grow guy to quibble over some dry cleaning. But seriously, how did you even get in here?

3
00:00:15.439 --> 00:00:17.300
You got a door?

4
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.960
Yeah, I walked and if you'd like me to show you again, I'm more than happy to

5
00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.899
Stop acting all high and mighty. We all know what kind of low-life you really are

6
00:00:26.379 --> 00:00:30.059
You don't belong here at the president's welcome banquet. You know

7
00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.859
Caroline's parents came in last night. You're probably snuck in with them

8
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.579
Kurt said the whole family got invited. Oh

9
00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.179
The whole family accepts you of course

10
00:00:40.939 --> 00:00:45.939
Let me tell you something if I was not here this banquet would be worth that time

11
00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:49.460
Seriously, what does this even have to do with you?

12
00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.179
Listen for old time's sake. Why don't you just leave before we all knock you out of the room?

13
00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.620
You

14
00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:06.700
Again

15
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:13.540
We finally get to attend this fancy bag one and you have to show up and ruin every

16
00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.379
I'm really if Caroline doesn't divorce you you're going to drag us all down

17
00:01:19.099 --> 00:01:22.379
Kirk's not here and the losers like you should go leaves
