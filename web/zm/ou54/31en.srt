1
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:06,870
My mom just texted, apparently Philip showed up with a big credit. He's in a lot of trouble.

2
00:00:07,969 --> 00:00:09,970
That loser must have snuck in somehow.

3
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:13,099
Oh, he's in real trouble this time.

4
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:15,099
Would you continue helping?

5
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:24,649
Please, get on the floor and show me how to crawl out of this room.

6
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:25,649
Go ahead.

7
00:00:25,649 --> 00:00:29,100
What the fuck? Looks like I'm going to teach you a lesson.

8
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:36,390
You know, a lot of people keep asking for an ass beating today.

9
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,159
Do you even know who the fuck I am?

10
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:40,159
Tell him Carl.

11
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:43,859
And you know what? I don't give a fuck about who you are.

12
00:00:43,859 --> 00:00:47,859
Because the Wharton group just seems to be hiring a bunch of idiots nowadays.

13
00:00:47,859 --> 00:00:49,859
And you know what I'm going to do?

14
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:50,859
Maybe.

15
00:00:50,859 --> 00:00:54,859
I'm going to write a review on your management policy.

16
00:00:54,859 --> 00:00:55,859
And you better wait.

17
00:00:55,859 --> 00:01:01,579
You idiot shut up already.

18
00:01:01,579 --> 00:01:04,579
You hit the head of security and you're ruining the banquet.

19
00:01:04,579 --> 00:01:06,579
And you're letting me see.

20
00:01:06,579 --> 00:01:08,870
You know what Doris?

21
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:12,540
I'm not the one that needs saving.

22
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,060
You are.

23
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:17,040
And man, walk it.

24
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,040
Guys, get over here.

25
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,040
Throw this piece of shit out and feed him through a pulpit you have to.

26
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:30,379
Stop it.

27
00:01:30,379 --> 00:01:34,370
Your husband isn't nobody.

28
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:36,590
Why do you even care?

29
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:42,840
I would be happy to help him find a job as long as you meet my terms.

30
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,989
It's money.

31
00:01:44,989 --> 00:01:49,180
No, Carol. All I want is you.

32
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:57,980
Carol, what a bitch.

33
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:03,819
No one believes any of your nonsense.

34
00:02:03,819 --> 00:02:06,819
We're all high ranking members of the Wharton group here.

35
00:02:06,819 --> 00:02:07,819
And this is how you talk to us.

36
00:02:07,819 --> 00:02:11,819
When you die, I'm going to bring a bottle of piss to pour on your grave.

37
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:12,819
Yeah.

38
00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:13,979
Oh.

39
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:22,849
I'm sorry.

40
00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:24,849
I'm going to be the way to do it.

41
00:02:24,849 --> 00:02:26,580
Are you okay?

42
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,580
Yeah.

43
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:28,580
Let's just see that guy.

44
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:29,580
What happened?

45
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:30,580
Carol, I agree.

46
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:31,580
There you are.

47
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:35,969
Sir, someone is causing trouble at the welcome banquet.

48
00:02:35,969 --> 00:02:36,969
Kurt.

49
00:02:36,969 --> 00:02:39,969
You're the highest ranking member of the Wharton group here.

50
00:02:39,969 --> 00:02:41,969
Only you can deal with this loser.

51
00:02:41,969 --> 00:02:45,969
Hey, and don't let this cocksucker off easy, all right?

52
00:02:45,969 --> 00:02:46,969
You parasite.

53
00:02:46,969 --> 00:02:48,969
I don't think you'd actually show up here.

54
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:51,969
I have more of a right to be here than anyone here.

55
00:02:51,969 --> 00:02:57,030
And also, if I want any last one of you to leave, I can make that happen.

56
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:59,030
Caroline, you see this?

57
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:02,030
Your husband has nothing but a violent, lying-ass clown.

58
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:04,030
Kurt, don't say that.

59
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:06,090
I don't even have to say anything.

60
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:09,090
I can just stand next to him, you know, with superior.

61
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:11,090
I'm the vice minister of the Wharton administration.

62
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:16,090
My uncle is the president, and you're just a pro-lying-ass clown.

63
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:20,280
Kurt, if you keep talking, you're going to lose your job.

64
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,280
Not only your job, but you're going to bring your uncle down with you.

65
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,280
So good?

66
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,280
What the fuck did you just say to me?

67
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,280
I think you heard me.

68
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,629
Caroline is mine.

69
00:03:28,629 --> 00:03:31,629
She will divorce you in coming running into my arms.

70
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:35,360
Okay, let me tell you something.

71
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,360
You're never going to put a finger on her again.

72
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,360
Or I'm going to rip your fucking head off, and I'm going to display it in the middle of the party tonight.

73
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,360
Sound good?

74
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,360
What the fuck did you just say to me?

75
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,360
I think you fucking heard me.

76
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,360
Caroline is mine.

77
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,360
You're nothing but a worthless, lying-ass clown.

78
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,960
Now you see?

79
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,960
That is all the hell.

80
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,960
What were you saying about Caroline?

81
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,960
You've filled me straight off.

82
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:00,960
If you have any idea who he is, you're going to be way over your head.

83
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,960
You idiot.

84
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:05,599
I'm going to ask you one more time.

85
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,599
Who is with Caroline?

86
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,599
Philip, stop, let me go.

87
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:10,599
It's okay.

88
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:11,599
You see, Caroline has more sense.

89
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:12,599
You want me to sit again?

90
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:13,599
Fine, I will.

91
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:14,599
You don't deserve Caroline.

92
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:17,600
She's all mine, and you're just a worthless woman.

93
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:33,290
You're a fucking terrorist.

94
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:35,290
I'm calling your doctor.

95
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:36,290
What are you doing?

96
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:37,860
How can you be the reckless?

97
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,860
You're going to go to jail.

98
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,860
Caroline, what are you doing?

99
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:42,860
Get away from him.

100
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:43,860
He is a criminal.

101
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,860
Mom, I will always stand by my husband.

102
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,060
First of all, I'm not a criminal.

103
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:52,149
Caroline, thank you for always waiting for me.

104
00:04:52,149 --> 00:04:56,180
You're being there for me and supporting me.

105
00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:00,000
You are my greatest fortune in my life.

106
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Finally saying your goodbyes.

107
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Oh, sure.

108
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,019
Look at me.

109
00:05:05,019 --> 00:05:06,860
You trust me?

110
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:10,319
No.

111
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:13,060
These people are a little cocky.

112
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:16,860
And I can make them go away very quickly.

113
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,139
And you give me.

114
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:31,379
Philip, just when I thought you couldn't get any more ridiculous,

115
00:05:31,379 --> 00:05:33,379
you're proven me wrong.

116
00:05:33,379 --> 00:05:36,379
Doris, please sue me.

117
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:39,379
Don't let anyone know that we're classmates.

118
00:05:39,379 --> 00:05:43,589
I cannot afford my reputation to flip it down.

119
00:05:43,589 --> 00:05:44,589
What do you think?

120
00:05:44,589 --> 00:05:46,980
Want me to give you a try?

121
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,230
This isn't the time for jokes.

122
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:51,230
Oh, I'm not joking this week, huh?

123
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:58,339
Great.

124
00:05:58,339 --> 00:05:59,339
I got what I wanted.

125
00:05:59,339 --> 00:06:01,339
Now let the show be taken.

126
00:06:01,339 --> 00:06:02,339
You didn't sound of a bitch.

127
00:06:02,339 --> 00:06:04,339
You kissed my girl in front of me.

128
00:06:04,339 --> 00:06:06,339
I swear I'll kill you for this.

129
00:06:06,339 --> 00:06:08,110
Okay, Kurt.

130
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:11,110
You're not going to have a chance to kill me after this.

131
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:12,180
Bullshit!

132
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,180
Let's see.

133
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,180
Hello, everybody.

134
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,180
Um, hmm.

135
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:19,180
Oh, we have the Vice President of the Wharton Group.

136
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,180
Right here.

137
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,180
Yes.

138
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:24,180
Representative of Ravenham, the auto branch.

139
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,180
Mm-hmm.

140
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:29,180
And a senior member of the Wharton Finance.

141
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,269
Oh, and we can't forget.

142
00:06:31,269 --> 00:06:34,269
Captain of the Wharton's Head Security.

143
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:36,269
Look at that, everybody, huh?

144
00:06:36,269 --> 00:06:39,269
Are you just listing all the people you pissed off?

145
00:06:39,269 --> 00:06:40,269
Well, too bad for you.

146
00:06:40,269 --> 00:06:42,269
Looks like you're not getting out of here alive.

147
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:45,269
Well, uh, quite the opposite, Tessa.

148
00:06:45,269 --> 00:06:51,170
You see, um, this banquet, yeah, it's actually for me.

149
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:55,170
And I can make all of you guys disappear at any moment if I would like.

150
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:59,050
Oh!

151
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:04,050
So, are you saying you're actually the guest of honor for this banquet, the President,

152
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:07,050
and when I had my own volunteer lunch, I was touching the President's book.

153
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:08,050
Is that right?

154
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:09,050
Yes, Kurt.

155
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:13,370
And you have made a very bad mistake.

156
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:15,779
And you know what?

157
00:07:15,779 --> 00:07:20,360
It's going to cost you everything.

158
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:25,509
Enough with your bullshit.

159
00:07:25,509 --> 00:07:27,509
Stop making a fool of yourself.

160
00:07:27,509 --> 00:07:29,509
Haven't you taken this far enough?

161
00:07:29,509 --> 00:07:33,509
You snuck your way into this banquet without permission,

162
00:07:33,509 --> 00:07:35,509
and we were willing to grant you that.

163
00:07:35,509 --> 00:07:36,509
But then you make a big deal, yeah.

164
00:07:36,509 --> 00:07:37,509
Attack, Kurt.

165
00:07:37,509 --> 00:07:39,509
You attack Carl.

166
00:07:39,509 --> 00:07:43,509
And now you are saying you are the President of the Wharton Group.

167
00:07:43,509 --> 00:07:47,509
You are completely insane.

168
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:50,509
And if I had known that it was going to go this far,

169
00:07:50,509 --> 00:07:54,509
I would have done everything in my power to keep you from marrying Carl.

170
00:07:54,509 --> 00:07:55,509
That was great, Doris.

171
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:58,509
But you know what? I think it's time.

172
00:07:58,509 --> 00:08:03,990
Cody!

173
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:04,990
Yes, Kurt.

174
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:05,990
Yes.

175
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:10,019
The party is about to start, so please, come over now.

176
00:08:10,019 --> 00:08:13,019
But you are not here in five minutes.

177
00:08:13,019 --> 00:08:15,279
Don't bother showing up.

178
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:18,660
Yes, sir. I'll be there right away.

179
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,660
I wonder why Mr. Edwards was so mad.

180
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:23,009
Did I do something wrong?

181
00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:33,360
What are you doing?

182
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,360
Don't you get it, Caroline?

183
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,360
He's still lying.

184
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,360
He's pretending to be the President of the Wharton Group,

185
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,360
and he just disrespected Cody in front of everyone.

186
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,549
Listen, maybe you wouldn't sound so pathetic.

187
00:08:48,549 --> 00:08:49,549
You would talk to somebody else.

188
00:08:49,549 --> 00:08:51,549
Do you know who Cody is?

189
00:08:51,549 --> 00:08:54,549
He's the manager of the Wharton Group, and he's my uncle.

190
00:08:54,549 --> 00:08:58,350
And is that supposed to make me scared?

191
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:01,350
Of course, you should be on the ground, because you might feel like the little worm you are.

192
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:02,350
Okay, Caroline.

193
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:06,350
Who the hell do you think you're talking to?

194
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:11,659
Uncle Cody, it's good to see you. It's nice to have you here.

195
00:09:11,659 --> 00:09:13,659
Let me introduce you to everyone.

196
00:09:13,659 --> 00:09:17,659
Everyone, this is Cody, the manager of the Wharton Group and my uncle.

197
00:09:17,659 --> 00:09:19,659
Merry Christmas, Cody.

198
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:21,659
Merry Christmas, sir.

199
00:09:21,659 --> 00:09:24,779
You didn't cause any trouble, did you?

200
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:27,779
Of course not, I was putting this cloud in his place.

201
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:28,779
Wow?

202
00:09:28,779 --> 00:09:30,000
That's right, him.

203
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
He's been causing trouble at the welcome banquet, and he's claiming he's the President of the Wharton Group.

204
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Can you believe this line? He's a trash water joke.

205
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Hey, Cody.

206
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,190
Can you please put this advantage in place?

207
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:43,190
How dare you disrespect my uncle.

208
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:46,190
You're finished. I'm going to kill you, and Caroline will be mine.

209
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:51,820
Uncle, how did you do that? You should be punishing him not me.

210
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:56,820
Philip Edwards is the President of the Wharton Group.

211
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:11,820
Think I knew who the President is?

212
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:18,379
I'm sorry, but you had to find out this way.

213
00:10:18,379 --> 00:10:23,379
So, this entire time you have been the most horrible person in the state and you have no idea.

214
00:10:23,379 --> 00:10:24,379
Yes.

215
00:10:24,379 --> 00:10:27,379
But you know, sometimes a bunch of idiots just have to learn the hard way.

216
00:10:27,379 --> 00:10:30,019
Secrets out, right?

217
00:10:30,019 --> 00:10:32,340
I am so sorry Mr. Edwards.

218
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,340
I had no idea, Kurt was so disrespectful.

219
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:39,570
I'll have him removed from the Wharton Group immediately.

220
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:41,570
No, Uncle, please, I'm here enough.

221
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:43,570
You're helping me treat you like this?

222
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:48,679
Not anymore. I want nothing to do with you.

223
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:53,120
It's impossible. How can you be the President?

224
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:58,269
You know, Kurt, I can ruin your fucking life.

225
00:10:58,269 --> 00:11:02,269
And I can make sure that your entire family tree disappears like this.

226
00:11:02,269 --> 00:11:04,269
You want to fucking try me?

227
00:11:04,269 --> 00:11:12,629
Oh, no!

228
00:11:12,629 --> 00:11:13,629
Please, I beg you.

229
00:11:13,629 --> 00:11:25,250
David, Pessa, you know, we could have been friends.

230
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:28,250
And I could have supported your careers.

231
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:32,250
But you had to let money and power blind you.

232
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:36,250
And another thing, I've seen how you treated people that are poor.

233
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,409
It's shit.

234
00:11:37,409 --> 00:11:41,299
You know how you know? You know we're just joking.

235
00:11:41,299 --> 00:11:44,299
We were stupid, but we're still old friends, please.

236
00:11:44,299 --> 00:11:45,299
Just for you guys.

237
00:11:45,299 --> 00:11:46,299
Please, we won't do it again.

238
00:11:46,299 --> 00:11:48,340
We were never friends.

239
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:56,700
Heidi and Nick and Cornell and Doris.

240
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,700
You guys are my family.

241
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,700
And I used to love you.

242
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,700
And I used to trust you until you bullied me.

243
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:08,789
Knocked me down and treated me like absolutely fucking shit.

244
00:12:08,789 --> 00:12:11,789
Doris, you've even tried to meet Caroline.

245
00:12:11,789 --> 00:12:16,879
Leave me for somebody else.

246
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:20,970
I am sorry.

247
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:23,970
I really never showed up because of you.

248
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:29,279
We had no way to avoid the president!

249
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,110
Tell us!

250
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:37,559
Well, if I had tried to tell you, I would have never been able to see your true colors.

251
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:46,889
Now, I think that it's time that you both learned the consequences!

252
00:12:46,889 --> 00:12:49,299
And you know what?

253
00:12:49,299 --> 00:12:50,299
There's still my family.

254
00:12:50,299 --> 00:12:51,299
Okay? There's still my family.

255
00:12:51,299 --> 00:12:53,299
Please, just don't be too hard on them.

256
00:12:53,299 --> 00:12:57,259
You know, I think all of you...

257
00:12:57,259 --> 00:12:59,259
Oh, Caroline, a big thank you.

258
00:12:59,259 --> 00:13:04,259
And I never want to see any of your ugly faces and raving him again.

259
00:13:04,259 --> 00:13:05,259
You got it!

260
00:13:05,259 --> 00:13:07,409
You won't.

261
00:13:07,409 --> 00:13:09,409
You are my son-in-law, Thela.

262
00:13:09,409 --> 00:13:13,590
And you and Caroline, it was a perfect color.

263
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:14,590
And you!

264
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:19,509
Oh, we're just getting started with you.

265
00:13:19,509 --> 00:13:20,509
Get him the fuck out of here.

266
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:21,509
Yes, sir.

267
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:23,509
Get him the fuck out of here.

268
00:13:23,509 --> 00:13:25,509
Oh, look who it is!

269
00:13:25,509 --> 00:13:27,509
I almost forgot about you.

270
00:13:27,509 --> 00:13:29,509
The head of the Wharton's hotel security.

271
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:31,509
I'm going to tell you something.

272
00:13:31,509 --> 00:13:33,509
You have ten seconds to get out of my fucking door.

273
00:13:33,509 --> 00:13:34,509
No!

274
00:13:34,509 --> 00:13:35,509
No!

275
00:13:35,509 --> 00:13:36,509
No!

276
00:13:36,509 --> 00:13:37,509
No!

277
00:13:37,509 --> 00:13:38,509
Eight!

278
00:13:38,509 --> 00:13:39,509
Seven!

279
00:13:39,509 --> 00:13:44,230
Now you guys can get rid of me.

280
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:45,230
They're going to be Uncle Cody.

281
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:46,230
Please!

282
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:53,820
Please!

283
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,820
Listen, I had the worst luck.

284
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:56,820
So it's great in my car.

285
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,820
That's why I was late.

286
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,820
Also, I heard your loser husband crash those welcome papers.

287
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:02,820
Where is he?

288
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,820
I want to give him a piece of my mind.

289
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:09,139
Mr. President, it's so good to see you again.

290
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:11,139
And Merry Christmas.

291
00:14:11,139 --> 00:14:12,139
Merry Christmas.

292
00:14:12,139 --> 00:14:14,259
I'm actually Caroline.

293
00:14:14,259 --> 00:14:15,259
Loser.

294
00:14:15,259 --> 00:14:17,610
What?

295
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:20,610
I just found out today, too.

296
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:26,019
Your Caroline's husband, who was broke and was gone for three years.

297
00:14:26,019 --> 00:14:33,690
And you're the wife the President traveled all the way here to spend Christmas with?

298
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:34,690
Oh my God.

299
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:37,009
Oh my God, it's right.

300
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:40,440
Caroline.

301
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:48,240
Listen, I've been consumed by work for the last three years and I have not put enough

302
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,590
time into us.

303
00:14:52,590 --> 00:15:03,100
And everybody has been taking me down and not giving me enough time to show who I really

304
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,100
am.

305
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:07,659
I apologize for that.

306
00:15:07,659 --> 00:15:16,480
And I want you to know that I love you and that I'm happy with you.

307
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,370
And that I want to continue being with you.

308
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:24,720
This is so feels like a dream.

309
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,720
Well, you know what?

310
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,720
It's not a dream.

311
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,720
Merry Christmas.

312
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:37,259
And from now on, as we Christmas after this, we are going to spend it together.
