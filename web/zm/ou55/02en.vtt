00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.339
I saw it with my own eyes. Madam Helen found out that Gavin and Caria have been sleeping together.

2
00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:18.600
Then Caria pushed me down the stairs.

3
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:28.420
Look. I wasn't me. I didn't push her. Madam Helen fell down the stairs all by herself.

4
00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.719
I believe you. It's okay.

5
00:00:31.719 --> 00:00:37.399
Richard. Richard.

6
00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:40.070
Yeah!

7
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:49.869
I just saved Madam Helen.

8
00:00:49.869 --> 00:01:01.850
There is no proven treatment for vegetative patients.

9
00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:09.359
Samantha, is Helen's only mentioned blood type. If she volunteers for the trials,

10
00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:30.959
it will greatly improve heran's chances of waking up.

11
00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:34.959
You signed the contract voluntarily. I do not make you.

12
00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:40.040
Continue your duties until this is over.

13
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.040
Richard, I'll pay what I owe you with my life.
