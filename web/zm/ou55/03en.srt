1
00:00:02,029 --> 00:00:04,730
Are you bullying Samantha again?

2
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:13,220
Please don't misunderstand. Richard was just giving me some new health supplements this company is developing.

3
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:16,219
He really cares about me and wanted me to try them.

4
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:20,440
I just spilled them all just now.

5
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:23,949
Okay, well that's good then.

6
00:00:23,949 --> 00:00:29,750
By the way, tomorrow we're going to have a small wedding ceremony for Carrie and I.

7
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:32,649
I hope both of you come.

8
00:00:32,649 --> 00:00:37,479
Are you really going to marry the maid? My mother's in a fucking coma?

9
00:00:37,479 --> 00:00:40,479
Can you wait? Do you have any fucking remorse?

10
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:45,740
Your mother and I were divorced two years ago, please.

11
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:47,740
So carry a little respect.

12
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:52,869
Don't act like you fucking care about me.

13
00:00:52,869 --> 00:00:56,060
Richard, can't you be nicer to me?

14
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:58,060
You're not disgust to me.

15
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:08,489
If you knew that I will die soon,

16
00:01:08,489 --> 00:01:11,489
put your heartbreak even just a little.
