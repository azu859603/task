00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:07.710
Plus, our R&D team has developed a new injection, it'll be so much more effective than the

2
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:14.820
previous oral medication.

3
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.199
The only downside being that it might harm the human trial subject a little more, but

4
00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:23.969
how much of a risk will this pose on Samantha?

5
00:00:23.969 --> 00:00:32.039
Well, we don't have any case studies yet to refer to, but Samantha is the only voluntary

6
00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:36.469
subject to help aid your mother's condition.

7
00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:58.740
Please discuss it with her.

8
00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:59.899
You're not welcome here.

9
00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:04.659
I know you have lung cancer and you're upset about it.

10
00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:06.659
Don't worry, I won't tell my truth.

11
00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:07.659
Get out.

12
00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:09.459
Now!

13
00:01:09.459 --> 00:01:13.659
You're already dying.

14
00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:17.659
Stop dreaming about Richard.

15
00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:21.810
You know well what I'm capable of.

16
00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:22.810
What did you do?

17
00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:30.530
How do you think Madam Helen found out about your mother sleeping with Gavin?

18
00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.069
I cannot believe that you did this.
