Hi, you're awake so you stay here watching over me all night Samantha

2
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:24,579
What made you cough up blood? It's just

3
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:29,800
My old stomach is just acting up. You see that's the thing. I

4
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:45,950
Haven't really heard about your stomach is just before so I'm glad you're doing well. I'm leaving

00:00:45,950 --> 00:01:03,700
He was a little boy, but now every time he sees me he looks at me like I miss a worst enemy

6
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,700
Don't say that

00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:14,739
Well tomorrow is my wedding to Gavin and I will find you a rich fiance from the wedding attendees

8
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:21,769
Just forget about Richard. You're pitiful act fooled me again. You and your mother's scheme makes me sick

00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:26,209
Well, no

11
00:01:26,209 --> 00:01:28,780
You can't do this

12
00:01:30,849 --> 00:01:35,890
Richard will never forgive me. Don't forget about him

13
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:43,480
I'm the woman of Gavin's household now. Remember you can only ever be Richard's step sister
