WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.540
No, I can't do it myself. Oh, so you're playing hard to get now

2
00:00:04.099 --> 00:00:08.679
Get into your turdiness. Don't do this. I don't feel well

3
00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:13.220
It's your closer stage. So you know what that means? You're gonna have to clean. You know what? I'm clean

4
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:29.690
How can you stop me? Please don't. I feel awful. I don't want to do it. I'm pretending because I know that your mother is talking a lot about sex, hasn't she?

5
00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:44.759
Don't do this

6
00:00:44.759 --> 00:01:00.570
Miss are you all right? I'm fine

7
00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:03.770
Everything's fine.

8
00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:28.540
Boss, the new drug is ready. You need to bring in Samantha for testing

9
00:01:30.379 --> 00:01:34.379
Okay, yeah, I will bring her in shortly.

10
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.459
She's a tough girl. Keep going.

11
00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:15.770
The moment you made me spare Cara, you should have known the pain that you were going to have to endure

12
00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.439
Richard, why do I feel like I'm about to die?

13
00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:28.490
Hey, why is she getting pale? What's going on?

14
00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.360
The new medication may have some substantial side effects, but

15
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.099
Samantha's vitals are strong. We can continue if needed

16
00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:43.599
Boss, this is for your mom. She can handle it. Stop. We'll continue next time

17
00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:59.680
Miss Samantha

18
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.680
Even your current condition

19
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.750
You have the right to terminate the contract and stop the drug trials

20
00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:18.090
My illness is beyond saving anyway. I will make the most time. I hope you don't regret it

21
00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:36.280
Samantha, you'll wait. I thought you'd never wake up. You know, when you were knocked out

22
00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:40.240
The boss just insisted that you keep going with the injection

23
00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:43.240
No matter what happens, and I

24
00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:48.099
Honestly, I was concerned about your well-being

25
00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:56.000
Yeah, don't be mad. At least I was here to take care of you while you were passed out. I said get out

26
00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:05.710
Can I ask you what's going on? Why are you throwing cups?

27
00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:09.620
Richard, I was wrong to fall in love with you

28
00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:15.270
Just woke up. All right, you're still frail

29
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.720
Where do you think you're gonna go in this state?

30
00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:37.740
Korea has severed ties with you. Do you have anywhere else that you can go?

31
00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:47.290
I can go to Ethan's house for now. Ethan's you can go to Ethan's because there's just so many men that are chasing you

32
00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:50.730
None of my concerns matter. That is the problem between us. Do you understand?

33
00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:56.790
And you know what? You know what? No, you're not gonna go to Ethan's. You're gonna go to my house and he was gonna take you there

34
00:04:56.949 --> 00:04:58.949
David, David's gonna take you there. Got it?

35
00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:04.740
Let me go pack some clothes first. Fine. Pack some clothes

36
00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:15.279
I can't believe this bitch is now a step closer to the boss because of the mess that she caused

37
00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:33.899
You still have the nerve to show your face around here

38
00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:41.949
You went through my things. How else was I supposed to know you've been secretly testing drugs for how

39
00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:43.990
I'm going behind my back. I

40
00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:49.189
Wouldn't have put myself through any of this if it wasn't to make amends for your wrongdoings

41
00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:55.689
Pack your bags and get the hell out of this house

42
00:05:56.569 --> 00:06:12.730
So make that kick you out. I already said I'd got a richer toast

43
00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:39.379
No, no, you can't go there. Okay. Come on with me here this

44
00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.300
These two go together

45
00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:45.139
Okay

46
00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:49.500
This Samantha was picked up by Ethan. She actually went to see Ethan

47
00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:55.240
Yes, I I heard actually had she pumped acted Ethan to pick her up

48
00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.180
So her going home to back was

49
00:06:58.439 --> 00:07:00.310
Just an excuse

50
00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:03.800
Peace. I'm gonna go get to the bottom of this

51
00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:12.000
Samantha you bitch. I didn't realize that you hold such an important place in Richard's heart

52
00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.680
Seems I underestimated you

53
00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:29.129
Thanks, you

54
00:07:33.449 --> 00:07:40.199
Samantha, you know how I feel about you. I don't want to think about this stuff, right?

55
00:07:40.519 --> 00:07:50.459
So you and Richard had a

56
00:07:50.459 --> 00:07:52.459
bastard

57
00:07:52.459 --> 00:07:55.939
I mean, uh, why don't you guys legally family? No

58
00:07:59.879 --> 00:08:09.769
Ethan, I don't want to talk about this stuff. I will I will always be by your side, okay?

59
00:08:11.319 --> 00:08:26.860
Please don't be upset

60
00:08:27.579 --> 00:08:29.959
Don't you put a fucking finger on her

61
00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:34.659
Let's go

62
00:08:34.659 --> 00:08:36.500
Which is like old Samantha

63
00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:40.340
This is none of your fucking business. Ethan, you okay?

64
00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:46.480
And how dare you define me? Are you really fucking enjoying yourself? Just making some motherfucker obsessed with you

65
00:08:47.679 --> 00:08:49.679
Let me remind you something

66
00:08:50.279 --> 00:08:52.730
You're just a maid's daughter

67
00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:54.370
Okay

68
00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:56.750
You don't deserve

69
00:08:56.950 --> 00:09:08.220
Men to be fawning over you. Don't insult her. You're coming with me mom wakes up. Don't go

70
00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:46.620
Put a finger on her

71
00:09:47.059 --> 00:09:49.720
You claimed to be as your woman in front of Ethan

72
00:09:50.120 --> 00:10:02.049
He is my friend and I don't want him fantasizing over you. I mean after all you do have a great talent for seducing men

73
00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:44.580
I don't want you seeing Ethan anymore. It's not what it looks like. There's nothing going on between us. They're better not be. Oh my god

74
00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:54.590
It's a ring though

75
00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:56.590
Richard you're the one that I love

76
00:10:56.909 --> 00:11:03.169
It's always been you

77
00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:05.370
Richard's birthday is almost here

78
00:11:19.529 --> 00:11:21.450
Happy birthday

79
00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:39.460
What are you doing? Are you really trying to provoke me like bringing this up today?

80
00:11:40.059 --> 00:11:47.289
When you're young you don't always have to pick you a cake, but I wanted to make you happy

81
00:12:17.529 --> 00:12:26.779
Forgot my mother was turning into a vegetable and you're gonna fucking celebrate that

82
00:12:28.860 --> 00:13:22.799
No, no, it's not like that your health condition is a drug trial

83
00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:30.809
Participant will affect the trial results. So please try not to get sick. Okay. Keep that in mind

84
00:13:31.490 --> 00:14:45.940
So I'm sorry

85
00:14:46.059 --> 00:14:58.620
I didn't mean to do that to you. It's my fault. You're cold. You have a fever. Hey

86
00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:02.879
You're what? Hold on

87
00:15:02.879 --> 00:15:09.519
Is it anything? Don't say that. Hey, are you thinking about another man? Well, you're with me. Hey

88
00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:12.539
Open your eyes. Look who's in front of you, huh?

89
00:15:13.809 --> 00:15:17.409
Yeah, Richard. You're in my bed. Don't speak about another man

90
00:15:17.809 --> 00:15:25.659
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. Yeah

91
00:15:27.639 --> 00:15:32.870
I don't have much time left. I'll do anything for you

92
00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:52.659
Just this is not working but

93
00:15:53.580 --> 00:16:11.210
Let me go get you some medicine. Look at it. Hey, open your mouth. Take this take this

94
00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:14.340
It's too bitter

95
00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:18.299
No piece of candy. I don't have a piece of candy. Take the medicine. It's too bitter

96
00:16:20.929 --> 00:16:42.500
Okay, are you gonna take the medicine or not? Because I can't help you if you're not gonna listen to me. All right. Just this one's okay

97
00:17:32.599 --> 00:17:34.599
Don't you put a fucking finger on her

98
00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:57.789
Let's go

99
00:17:57.789 --> 00:18:03.509
Richard, have you ever truly loved me? Are you trying to seduce me right now?

100
00:18:04.069 --> 00:18:22.009
Just let me be reckless this once

101
00:18:22.849 --> 00:18:50.990
You asked for this

102
00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:55.430
Mr. Richard never brings women home to make such a racket the first time

103
00:18:56.109 --> 00:19:47.869
So you finally got your way? No, you're pretty good, but

104
00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:51.319
quite satisfying

105
00:19:51.319 --> 00:19:57.859
Actually, I assume you're a slutty mother. You owe your skills

106
00:19:58.539 --> 00:20:23.619
You know from now on I think you can. Good morning

107
00:20:23.619 --> 00:20:25.740
I

108
00:20:26.769 --> 00:20:31.410
Have some company documents that urgently need you review. Thank you watch that door

109
00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:42.130
What a slutty seducer. Huh? I didn't think you had it in you all good

110
00:20:42.769 --> 00:20:45.630
No way back. Thank you

111
00:20:46.029 --> 00:20:53.970
Are you still lusting for sex even though you're dying?

112
00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:57.930
I bet that took a lot of effort for you to seduce Richard there

113
00:20:57.930 --> 00:21:02.579
And you know, I could just go get you tin hot jigalos to scratch that edge of your

114
00:21:03.299 --> 00:21:05.589
Don't take it too far Ada

115
00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:11.490
Don't take it too far Ada

116
00:21:16.690 --> 00:21:24.789
Miss Samantha here was just telling me how she has finally captured you and that she cannot wait for your mom to die

117
00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:27.789
Because then she won't have to be a human guinea pig anymore

118
00:21:28.269 --> 00:21:33.269
And I told her not to go so far and then she slapped me. That is not true Ada was the one who

119
00:21:33.789 --> 00:21:36.559
Richard believe me. I did not do that

120
00:21:37.039 --> 00:21:41.220
You know, I think I've been a little bit too lenient on you

121
00:21:41.619 --> 00:21:45.980
Well, she is one to faint innocence and act like a victim to manipulate people

122
00:21:47.099 --> 00:21:55.009
Who do you think you're saying shut up to it's made the we've only slept together like a few times

123
00:21:55.849 --> 00:21:59.380
Don't get any ideas. Okay, you're just a lowly

124
00:22:00.259 --> 00:22:01.819
He made his daughter

125
00:22:01.819 --> 00:22:09.130
Don't forget that now. I'm gonna want you to mop every single floor in this house today

126
00:22:09.849 --> 00:22:19.980
You got me. Let's finish that conversation, shall we?

127
00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:48.140
Samantha we need to talk about your condition

128
00:22:48.579 --> 00:22:51.089
Has my illness worsened? No

129
00:22:51.809 --> 00:23:13.779
You're pregnant. Are you sure that I'm pregnant will be in pregnant affect the drug trial in any way?

130
00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:17.250
Theoretically it shouldn't affect the trials

131
00:23:17.930 --> 00:23:24.710
But it will be harmful for you and with long-term drug trials the fetus may form of normalities

132
00:23:25.549 --> 00:23:27.549
Please you cannot tell Richard

133
00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:34.569
Okay, I'm already dying of lung cancer. I just I want to spend some time with my child

134
00:23:48.039 --> 00:23:50.240
Misera Samantha's pregnant

135
00:23:51.039 --> 00:23:53.720
What that bitch is pregnant?

136
00:23:54.839 --> 00:24:10.349
Already so feeble collapse just from hopping the floors

137
00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:13.960
Hey

138
00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:21.250
You don't truly love Samantha. Okay, you're using her if you truly don't care for her you let it be with me

139
00:24:21.250 --> 00:24:31.539
I never really remember her saying that she wanted to be with you

140
00:24:32.319 --> 00:24:35.920
No

141
00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:39.279
Don't smith smith that you were it

142
00:24:39.839 --> 00:24:58.250
Samantha Coleman you can't bring yourself to tell him then I will

143
00:25:03.779 --> 00:25:08.720
Everything that I've done for Richard. I did because I wanted to

144
00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:19.990
What are you hiding from me?

145
00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:33.730
Because you're not gonna be able to get away with it. You know I'll find out. Can you marry me? Don't be ridiculous

146
00:25:34.589 --> 00:25:36.589
Don't think that you can just

147
00:25:36.589 --> 00:25:38.589
Say whatever now because you're ill

148
00:25:41.069 --> 00:25:44.430
Just let me do as I please as I love you Richard

149
00:26:13.789 --> 00:26:17.009
Hello, I have headline news here

150
00:26:17.529 --> 00:26:26.160
so boss

151
00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:28.240
You made the front page headline

152
00:26:32.259 --> 00:26:35.450
What is this?

153
00:26:35.450 --> 00:26:38.369
Word is spreading that you and Samantha will be married soon

154
00:26:42.430 --> 00:26:49.029
Mary we're gonna be married David. I want you to find out who released this to you got it. Yes, sorry

155
00:26:49.710 --> 00:27:01.259
We'll figure the press have no other clues

156
00:27:01.779 --> 00:27:03.779
All I know it's from a female source

157
00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:09.579
The one benefiting most from this would be Samantha. I mean she would be exposing herself

158
00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:17.569
Can you marry me Samantha? Are you trying to force me into marriage?

159
00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:20.819
Do you think she orchestrated this herself?

160
00:27:21.339 --> 00:27:27.839
So Samantha wants our relationship to the public spotlight

161
00:27:29.019 --> 00:27:29.980
Okay

162
00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:35.890
We're going to indulge her. I want you to invite Samantha to attend the Gala

163
00:27:36.049 --> 00:27:48.180
With me

164
00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:54.140
Thank you. No need for formalities miss. I'll park the car. Boss is waiting for you upstairs

165
00:27:54.660 --> 00:28:22.900
Hey, Judy. I want you. What's surprised the one night?

166
00:28:24.059 --> 00:28:27.059
Name it name and I'll pay any say that's a price

167
00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:33.740
Come on. I know you want to I know you come on. Come on. We have a good time. Come over here. Go over here

168
00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:37.660
You know, I think you should sober up a little bit

169
00:28:40.099 --> 00:28:46.779
Where did you've gone too far? I'm your business partner

170
00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:51.660
What are you really willing to risk our partnership over some worthless woman?

171
00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:58.809
You think I want a partner with you? I don't and as for anybody else if anybody wants to partner with him

172
00:28:59.210 --> 00:29:01.410
You could be my enemy as well got it

173
00:29:03.630 --> 00:29:08.829
Richard, Richard. I'm sorry. Listen listen. I spoke to her Ashley. I made a mistake

174
00:29:09.390 --> 00:29:11.390
Do you know who the fuck she is?

175
00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:20.109
Because she's the maid's daughter and her mother is the one that's to do is my father Gavin

176
00:29:20.109 --> 00:29:21.910
So as for her

177
00:29:21.910 --> 00:29:23.910
She's just a cheap woman as well

178
00:29:24.029 --> 00:29:31.430
And for you to fancy somebody like that makes me doubt my judgment and I do not want to be in business with somebody like that

179
00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:34.630
Yes, sir

180
00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:39.960
So you're sad now

181
00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:44.559
Because I'm pretty sure that you're the one that wanted our relationship into the public spotlight, right?

182
00:29:45.079 --> 00:29:47.480
So pretty much I'm just abiding by you

183
00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:53.579
No, you've got it wrong. I didn't leak those photos. You know you didn't leak those photos and I know it was you

184
00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:55.220
What?

185
00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:56.420
Let's go

186
00:29:56.420 --> 00:30:01.339
At least you stood up for me against that vile man

187
00:30:01.779 --> 00:30:04.829
Don't you?

188
00:30:04.829 --> 00:30:09.630
Mr. Richard photos with online show you with the maid star at a hotel a rumor's true

189
00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:14.509
Are you an official cople inside sources say this maid's mother is already married to your father?

190
00:30:14.509 --> 00:30:21.630
It seems she'll sue Mary you too

191
00:30:21.670 --> 00:30:28.470
For Richard to lose control like this. He's never had a scandal. This woman was be no ordinary one

192
00:30:29.329 --> 00:30:33.809
You must really like this woman. I bet they're gonna announce our engagement soon. I'd add it

193
00:30:33.809 --> 00:30:35.809
She's probably just great in bed

194
00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:48.829
Is there a date for the wedding oh so this is your scheme Samantha trying to force me into marriage through public pressure I

195
00:30:49.710 --> 00:30:52.269
paid the press of fortune for this to ruin your reputation

196
00:30:54.539 --> 00:30:55.900
Listen

197
00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:57.900
It's very typical for

198
00:30:58.019 --> 00:31:00.619
Adults to have sexual desires and needs okay

199
00:31:00.619 --> 00:31:06.779
I don't think we should really care about some cheap war who really doesn't mean anything. Yes, I am sleeping with her

200
00:31:06.779 --> 00:31:13.380
But no I don't I don't love her. All right, and she has absolutely no impact in my life. Thank you very much

201
00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:18.380
Richard

202
00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:20.380
Richard

203
00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:29.000
Business updates, okay. Wait. Wait. Wait. This is Richard Richard. It's the Richard

204
00:31:29.299 --> 00:31:35.980
You know seeing how hard you've been trying to get me. I think from now on you'll be my fuck buddy

205
00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:41.960
And since we're living together well, no you're living with me. You're gonna start sleeping in my bed

206
00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:47.059
Are you satisfied now?

207
00:31:47.059 --> 00:31:49.059
Okay, are you satisfied

208
00:31:50.140 --> 00:32:00.960
What do you take me for I continue to act despicable Samantha you only deserved we treat it like a whore

209
00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:16.430
We can't do this now. Just stop isn't this what you want and stop pretending because everything you're saying it's fucking with me

210
00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:21.180
You understand no

211
00:32:23.180 --> 00:33:16.779
Sorry little your dad misunderstood me. He didn't mean it Samantha

212
00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:31.539
