00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:03.229
Time to do a check-up on the patients.

2
00:00:03.229 --> 00:00:06.070
Can you please wake her up so I can examine her?

3
00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:12.830
Hey, Aunt Helen, the nurse needs to run some exams on you.

4
00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.310
Aunt Helen.

5
00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:17.519
Aunt Helen.

6
00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:19.859
It's weird.

7
00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.940
Why is she sleeping so suddenly?

8
00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:33.539
There's been an emergency with the patients in room 405.

9
00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:35.100
Please inform her family.

10
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.990
She has been confirmed that...

11
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.710
What?

12
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.369
Boss is still unknown.

13
00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:40.130
No.

14
00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:41.490
No.

15
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:43.420
No. Aunt Helen.

16
00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:44.649
Wake up.

17
00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:45.810
Wake up.

18
00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:47.829
Helen, wake up.

19
00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:57.469
Wake up.

20
00:00:57.469 --> 00:00:58.469
What happened?

21
00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.070
Because yesterday she was perfectly fine and now all of a sudden she's fucking dead.

22
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.070
What happened?

23
00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:04.629
We still don't know the cause yet.

24
00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:05.950
We've called the police.

25
00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.269
They will determine the cause of death.

26
00:01:08.269 --> 00:01:12.769
Samantha, you promise to keep her safe.

27
00:01:12.769 --> 00:01:15.010
Is this what your fucking promises cost to you, huh?
