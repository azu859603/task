00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,919
No, I don't know. I don't know. I went to get medicine and when I came back she was, you don't know

2
00:00:06,459 --> 00:00:10,000
Samantha boss here has been really really good to you lately

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:14,660
You're the only one who's been with madam Helen. So what happened?

4
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,899
Hmm our

5
00:00:18,899 --> 00:00:22,730
Initial judgment is that madam Helen was murdered

6
00:00:24,969 --> 00:00:31,370
Cause of death was poison injected into her IV drip. Samantha. You are so cold-blooded

7
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:35,070
You know what I get it

8
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:42,090
You were afraid that if madam Helen regained her memory that she would ruin your relationship with Richard

9
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:45,130
You just finished her off

10
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:53,000
Is what she said fucking true, huh? Answer me

11
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,439
Richard you have to believe me. I did not do that

12
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:05,590
I don't believe fucking lies anymore, and I'm gonna make sure that you pay for fucking with my mother
