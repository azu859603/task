00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.179
Do you fucking hear me?

2
00:00:01.179 --> 00:00:02.379
No!

3
00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:06.450
Sir, sir, please, keep calm.

4
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:07.730
Call me.

5
00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:10.449
Although Samantha is the prime suspect,

6
00:00:10.449 --> 00:00:12.609
we don't have solid evidence yet

7
00:00:12.609 --> 00:00:14.580
that she's the murderer.

8
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:26.510
We will investigate through them.

9
00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:27.550
My baby.

10
00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.309
Baby, doctor, doctor, help me.

11
00:00:30.309 --> 00:00:31.149
Help me.

12
00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:41.539
What baby?

13
00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:43.219
Doc, how is she?

14
00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:45.100
The baby is safer now,

15
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.399
but she can't have any more emotional distress.

16
00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:51.990
Okay, but when did she even get pregnant?

17
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.380
It was before the last drug trial.

18
00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.619
And you didn't even want to tell me?

19
00:00:57.619 --> 00:01:01.100
The hospital has a due to respect the patient's privacy.
