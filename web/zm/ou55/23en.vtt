1
00:00:04.139 --> 00:00:11.509
Order some baby supplies, because the child will be here in a few months.

2
00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:15.509
Boss, you can't seriously forgive that woman just because of the child.

3
00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.510
You are my secretary.

4
00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:19.510
So stay out of my personal life and you know what?

5
00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.179
Watch your attitude with Samantha.

6
00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:24.179
She means a lot more to me than you know.

7
00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:47.859
Deeply sorry, I was out of line.

8
00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:50.859
Samantha, you calculating bitch.

9
00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:52.859
Trying to tie Richard down with a child?

10
00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:56.420
Well, you know what?

11
00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.420
In that case, I'll make sure the child disappears for good.

12
00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:11.799
Get me a really strong aphrodisiac.

13
00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:20.879
All right, so we'll have somebody call you.

14
00:01:20.879 --> 00:01:22.879
Sound good?

15
00:01:22.879 --> 00:01:25.879
To our promising business partnership.

16
00:01:25.879 --> 00:01:28.959
Yes.

17
00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:31.790
Oh, let's get you right in.

18
00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:41.409
Anna, can you please get me a concert?

19
00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:44.400
Right away, boss.

20
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:50.170
Can I get water?

21
00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.170
Yes, of course.

22
00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:57.620
Here you are.

23
00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:18.300
Can you take this glass of water to Mr. Richard?

24
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.300
I sent him to room 604, please.

25
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:51.740
I'm 604, this is it.

26
00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:59.979
Why is the door open?

27
00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:00.979
Richard?

28
00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:05.860
Where are you?

29
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.300
Richard?

30
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.889
Where are you?

31
00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:14.889
Are you okay?

32
00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:17.460
I need to have sex with you.

33
00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:18.460
I need help with you.

34
00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:19.550
No.

35
00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:20.550
Something is right.

36
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.550
I need to have sex with you.

37
00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:23.550
Stop.

38
00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:24.550
This could be bad for the baby.

39
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.550
I don't really fucking care about the baby to be honest.

40
00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:27.550
Stop.

41
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:28.550
Get off of me.

42
00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:29.550
No, Richard.

43
00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:30.550
You're wasted.

44
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:31.550
Did you fuck?

45
00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:41.379
Fuck.

46
00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:54.449
Fuck me.

47
00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:57.569
It was so weak already.

48
00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:04.539
I mean, how could she handle such rough sex?

49
00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:05.539
I don't know.

50
00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:11.419
I think maybe I was drunk.

51
00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:15.250
There is no excuse, Mr. Richard.

52
00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.579
Anyway, the baby is gone now.

53
00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:30.149
I'm sorry.

54
00:04:30.149 --> 00:04:33.399
No, you probably don't want to talk to me.

55
00:04:33.399 --> 00:04:34.399
Or see me.

56
00:04:34.399 --> 00:05:09.389
Yes, of course.

57
00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:12.019
Come on in.

58
00:05:12.019 --> 00:05:14.019
Gentlemen, come on in.

59
00:05:14.019 --> 00:05:19.089
Take a seat.

60
00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:20.889
We'll get out of here.

61
00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:23.889
We've confirmed that Samantha

62
00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:25.889
is not the murderer of your mother.

63
00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:38.060
Is this Ada?

64
00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:39.060
Yes.

65
00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.600
The killer is your secretary.

66
00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:46.540
The killer is your secretary.

67
00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:55.029
How could she?

68
00:05:55.029 --> 00:06:01.610
Helen fell down the stairs because Ada purposely showed her the affair photos to agitate her.

69
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:07.019
Ada was afraid that Helen would regain her memory and you'd find out the truth.

70
00:06:07.019 --> 00:06:13.379
So she chose to kill her.

71
00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:14.379
Thank you.

72
00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:31.149
Hey asshole.

73
00:06:31.149 --> 00:06:32.279
No.

74
00:06:32.279 --> 00:06:36.110
You ruined Samantha's life.

75
00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:39.740
Let me ask you a question.

76
00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:43.089
Did you know about everything?

77
00:06:43.089 --> 00:06:47.889
And if you did, why didn't you tell me?

78
00:06:47.889 --> 00:06:50.689
Isn't it obvious?

79
00:06:50.689 --> 00:06:52.879
It's because she loves you.

80
00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:53.879
Okay.

81
00:06:53.879 --> 00:06:57.709
When your mother went into a coma,

82
00:06:57.709 --> 00:07:00.709
Samantha was the only one that matched the drug trial criteria.

83
00:07:00.709 --> 00:07:02.709
She told you the truth.

84
00:07:02.709 --> 00:07:06.060
Did you still made her go through the trial?

85
00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:11.060
She didn't want to make you pick between her and your mother.

86
00:07:14.779 --> 00:07:18.160
Everything that I've done for Richard.

87
00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.160
I did because I wanted to.

88
00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:25.800
Hey.

89
00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.699
You got to make a mess.

90
00:07:28.699 --> 00:07:53.769
What you did wrong there.

91
00:07:53.769 --> 00:08:11.790
Samantha.

92
00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:14.790
Listen, I'm really, I'm really worried about you.

93
00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:18.939
Can you please open the door?

94
00:08:18.939 --> 00:08:20.939
Listen, I know everything now.

95
00:08:20.939 --> 00:08:21.970
Okay.

96
00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:27.290
And I'm sorry for suspecting you and not believing you.

97
00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:28.290
All right.

98
00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:31.779
I was blind.

99
00:08:31.779 --> 00:08:32.779
Samantha.

100
00:08:32.779 --> 00:08:34.820
Mary me, please.

101
00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:38.820
And I will spend the rest of my days making sure that you know that I care.

102
00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:39.820
Okay.

103
00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:40.820
We'll have a family.

104
00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:41.820
We'll have a life.

105
00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:44.820
We'll make our relationship better again.

106
00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:48.419
Please open the door.

107
00:08:48.419 --> 00:09:04.710
Please.

108
00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:16.299
Please.

109
00:09:16.299 --> 00:09:18.299
It's so long for you to propose to me.

110
00:09:18.299 --> 00:09:25.029
I want to marry you.

111
00:09:25.029 --> 00:09:32.919
I don't even marry you.

112
00:09:32.919 --> 00:09:34.919
Well, you're going to be my wife.

113
00:09:34.919 --> 00:09:37.269
And I'm going to cherish you.

114
00:09:37.269 --> 00:09:39.070
Every day.

115
00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:40.070
From now on.

116
00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:46.740
My miscarriage has accelerated the progression of your lung cancer.

117
00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:49.250
How much time do I have left?

118
00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:51.429
Three months.

119
00:09:51.429 --> 00:09:53.879
At most.

120
00:09:53.879 --> 00:10:02.779
Children, we're going to have so much children.

121
00:10:02.779 --> 00:10:06.299
You have no right to talk.

122
00:10:06.299 --> 00:10:10.500
There's no future with us.

123
00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:13.720
Well, you're not fucking going anywhere.

124
00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:23.860
You know what I'm capable of.

125
00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:27.470
But I don't want to lose you.

126
00:10:29.049 --> 00:10:31.909
I don't love you anymore, Richard.

127
00:10:31.909 --> 00:10:39.490
And you don't deserve my heart.

128
00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:40.490
What are you doing?

129
00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:43.419
You're packing a bag.

130
00:10:43.419 --> 00:10:45.090
I'm leaving you.

131
00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:54.509
Where are you going?

132
00:10:54.509 --> 00:10:56.509
You're not fucking leaving.

133
00:10:56.509 --> 00:10:58.629
No, you're not.

134
00:10:58.629 --> 00:10:59.629
You're going to leave me?

135
00:10:59.629 --> 00:11:04.259
Where are you going to go?

136
00:11:04.259 --> 00:11:05.259
Where are you going to go?

137
00:11:05.259 --> 00:11:07.259
My life has nothing to do with you now.

138
00:11:07.259 --> 00:11:09.509
You don't get to control me.

139
00:11:09.509 --> 00:11:14.710
Is it Ethan?

140
00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:31.340
Ethan, come get me.

141
00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:32.340
I'm at me.

142
00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:33.340
I'm thinking.

143
00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:34.340
Fucking.

144
00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:35.340
All Ethan in front of me.

145
00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:36.340
It's fucking rude.

146
00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:37.340
You don't love me at all.

147
00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:38.340
I don't love you.

148
00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:41.340
You're just a selfish, possessive jerk.

149
00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:45.610
Let me ask you something.

150
00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:47.610
You want to be in this so bad, right?

151
00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:48.610
Huh?

152
00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:49.610
I'll give you one.

153
00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:50.610
Take off your clothes.

154
00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:51.610
Stop.

155
00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:53.610
You're doing exactly what you did before.

156
00:11:53.610 --> 00:11:55.610
You already killed our baby.

157
00:11:55.610 --> 00:12:09.649
I know that it's all my fault.

158
00:12:09.649 --> 00:12:15.110
I fucking hate myself for it.

159
00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:18.110
But I will do anything to not lose you.

160
00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:19.110
Do you hear me?

161
00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:28.330
But I will do anything to not lose you.

162
00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:29.330
Do you hear me?

163
00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:35.029
For you.

164
00:12:35.029 --> 00:12:40.460
Unless you are dead.

165
00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:42.460
I will never leave you.

166
00:12:42.460 --> 00:13:21.350
I need to take a minute.

167
00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:24.559
Just go.

168
00:13:24.559 --> 00:13:25.559
I want privacy.

169
00:13:25.559 --> 00:13:30.220
Call me if you need something.

170
00:13:30.220 --> 00:14:10.169
That's how it is.

171
00:14:10.169 --> 00:15:44.259
I'll skip you through death.

172
00:15:44.259 --> 00:15:46.190
Isn't it?

173
00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:47.190
You hurt you again?

174
00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:49.190
Yeah, I'll confront him.

175
00:15:49.190 --> 00:16:01.529
I'll try to hurt him, please.

176
00:16:01.529 --> 00:16:02.529
Why would you do that?

177
00:16:02.529 --> 00:16:05.539
Tell me.

178
00:16:05.539 --> 00:16:06.539
Okay, yeah.

179
00:16:06.539 --> 00:16:08.120
I'll help you.

180
00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:10.980
No one can help me.

181
00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:15.419
My illness progressed.

182
00:16:15.419 --> 00:16:18.500
So, I only have three months.

183
00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:25.750
How could it progress so fast?

184
00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:27.970
Is Richard now?

185
00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:30.320
No, I don't want him to know.

186
00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:33.059
I don't want to haunt him even in death.

187
00:16:33.059 --> 00:16:54.730
So that's, uh...

188
00:16:54.730 --> 00:17:21.089
You still weren't fucking quit it now, will you?

189
00:17:21.089 --> 00:17:22.089
Let me talk with Richard.

190
00:17:22.089 --> 00:17:24.529
Go home.

191
00:17:24.529 --> 00:17:25.529
I'll call you if I need anything.

192
00:17:25.529 --> 00:17:36.740
I don't want to be here anymore.

193
00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:40.980
You need to recover.

194
00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:46.220
Okay, it's a lot better if you stay here and recuperate first, all right?

195
00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:48.220
No, I'm sick of this place.

196
00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:51.220
Keep remembering the terrible drug trials.

197
00:17:51.220 --> 00:18:15.170
I need you to promise me that you're not going to do anything foolish when we go home.

198
00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:16.170
Okay?

199
00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:39.819
I promise.

200
00:18:39.819 --> 00:18:45.279
Happy birth the fucking you're doing.

201
00:18:45.279 --> 00:18:47.049
Ethan?

202
00:18:47.049 --> 00:18:49.460
Do you understand that I'm...

203
00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:53.460
I'm setting up a surprise for you and you're near fucking cheating on me?

204
00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:54.460
Are you serious?

205
00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:57.099
Samantha?

206
00:18:57.099 --> 00:19:04.500
I told you I don't love you.

207
00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:06.500
I don't love you anymore, Richard.

208
00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:09.589
But you insisted on keeping me here.

209
00:19:09.589 --> 00:19:13.670
I have no choice.

210
00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:19.890
If we must, let's coexist as three peacefully.

211
00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:22.210
That's three.

212
00:19:22.210 --> 00:19:28.250
You know, I don't believe this for one second.

213
00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:31.250
Until you guys have sex in front of me.

214
00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:36.029
Samantha, okay.

215
00:19:36.029 --> 00:19:39.789
I can't help you here.

216
00:19:39.789 --> 00:20:19.650
He clearly isn't fooled.

217
00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:20.650
Where are you taking me?

218
00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:24.470
You're gonna like it.

219
00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:35.680
Ready.

220
00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:39.279
This is where you brought me?

221
00:20:39.279 --> 00:20:42.279
Please don't tell me you're gonna try to propose it when me over.

222
00:20:42.279 --> 00:20:46.279
Miss, can you please show me the dress that I had reserved?

223
00:20:46.279 --> 00:20:54.160
Of course.

224
00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:56.950
Oh my God.

225
00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:58.950
I designed this dress five years ago.

226
00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:16.319
It'd be amazing to wear this on my wedding day.

227
00:21:16.319 --> 00:21:20.509
Samantha, I'll make you the world's most beautiful bride.

228
00:21:20.509 --> 00:21:23.089
This was my design.

229
00:21:23.089 --> 00:21:24.089
When did you?

230
00:21:24.089 --> 00:21:29.599
Yes, you sketch this out in your room five years ago.

231
00:21:29.599 --> 00:21:32.819
And I took a picture.

232
00:21:32.819 --> 00:21:34.819
So back then, you already?

233
00:21:34.819 --> 00:21:38.819
Yes, I had decided to marry you five years ago.

234
00:21:38.819 --> 00:21:45.869
Now, I did have the designer tweak the size just a little bit, but I think it will fit.

235
00:21:45.869 --> 00:21:48.000
Please, try it out just for me.

236
00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:58.630
It's ready.

237
00:21:58.630 --> 00:21:59.630
Now look.

238
00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:18.269
Does it look bad on me?

239
00:22:18.269 --> 00:22:19.269
No.

240
00:22:19.269 --> 00:22:20.269
Sorry.

241
00:22:20.269 --> 00:22:22.269
I lost my friends out there for a second.

242
00:22:22.269 --> 00:22:26.420
You look beautiful.

243
00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:31.119
And I love you so much.

244
00:22:31.119 --> 00:22:37.299
Marry me.

245
00:22:37.299 --> 00:22:39.869
Please.

246
00:22:39.869 --> 00:22:43.119
How much time do I have left?

247
00:22:43.119 --> 00:22:46.240
Three months.

248
00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:47.240
It's most.

249
00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:50.450
Marry me.

250
00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:51.450
Samantha.

251
00:22:51.450 --> 00:23:01.140
Richard, don't you understand it's too late for us?

252
00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:02.140
No.

253
00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:05.140
It's not too late, and it will never be too late for us.

254
00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:06.140
Come here.

255
00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:07.500
Just stop.

256
00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:21.700
Sir, the photo came out of there well.

257
00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:26.859
Thank you.

258
00:23:26.859 --> 00:23:34.740
Thank you so much for you.

259
00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:36.190
Have a wonderful day.

260
00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:53.089
I did those two get to be happy while I brought away prison.

261
00:23:53.089 --> 00:23:56.339
I will not let them get away with this.

262
00:23:56.339 --> 00:24:04.789
Miss Samantha, may I have the honor of courting you?

263
00:24:04.789 --> 00:24:06.980
I refuse.

264
00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:15.700
Well, then I'm just going to have to-

265
00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:19.609
Give up?

266
00:24:19.609 --> 00:24:21.759
No.

267
00:24:21.759 --> 00:24:23.759
Keep trying for you, actually.

268
00:24:23.759 --> 00:24:26.049
You're deliberately teasing me.

269
00:24:26.049 --> 00:24:28.210
Samantha.

270
00:24:28.210 --> 00:24:33.220
Samantha?

271
00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:36.650
Samantha?

272
00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:40.500
Okay.

273
00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:57.720
What are you doing here?

274
00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:00.940
I broke out.

275
00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:02.940
I don't belong in a hell hole like that.

276
00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:05.029
Imagine like this suits me.

277
00:25:05.029 --> 00:25:08.250
And you?

278
00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:12.829
I do.

279
00:25:12.829 --> 00:25:19.319
I am much more beautiful, better built.

280
00:25:19.319 --> 00:25:22.319
What does she have that I don't have, huh?

281
00:25:22.319 --> 00:25:25.319
You are beautiful.

282
00:25:25.319 --> 00:25:28.700
And smart and capable.

283
00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:32.089
And any man would love to be with you.

284
00:25:32.089 --> 00:25:33.089
They would.

285
00:25:33.089 --> 00:25:36.619
This is true.

286
00:25:36.619 --> 00:25:40.799
Then why aren't we together?

287
00:25:40.799 --> 00:25:43.829
I didn't know that you liked me.

288
00:25:43.829 --> 00:25:46.829
And if I had known, then we could have been together.

289
00:25:46.829 --> 00:25:51.180
And had a family.

290
00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:52.339
Okay.

291
00:25:52.339 --> 00:25:57.079
No.

292
00:25:57.079 --> 00:25:58.079
No.

293
00:25:58.079 --> 00:25:59.079
No.

294
00:25:59.079 --> 00:26:01.359
No.

295
00:26:01.359 --> 00:26:02.359
No.

296
00:26:02.359 --> 00:26:03.359
No.

297
00:26:03.359 --> 00:26:04.359
No.

298
00:26:04.359 --> 00:26:05.359
No.

299
00:26:05.359 --> 00:26:06.359
No.

300
00:26:06.359 --> 00:26:07.970
No.

301
00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:16.549
No.

302
00:26:16.549 --> 00:26:17.549
No.

303
00:26:17.549 --> 00:26:24.890
No.

304
00:26:24.890 --> 00:26:25.890
No.

305
00:26:25.890 --> 00:26:26.890
No.

306
00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:27.890
No.

307
00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:28.890
No.

308
00:26:28.890 --> 00:26:29.890
No.

309
00:26:29.890 --> 00:26:30.890
No.

310
00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:45.299
No.

311
00:26:45.299 --> 00:26:46.299
No.

312
00:26:46.299 --> 00:27:39.329
She's not been shot.

313
00:27:39.329 --> 00:27:42.700
She had three months left to live.

314
00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:44.700
Yeah, I know that it was my fault.

315
00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:50.349
The truck trials ruined her health.

316
00:27:50.349 --> 00:27:54.589
We'd stitched long cancer.

317
00:27:54.589 --> 00:28:00.180
She never wanted you to know, but I need to tell you.

318
00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:01.180
She took away the one I love.

319
00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:09.809
I know that it was all my fault.

320
00:28:09.809 --> 00:28:32.420
I know that.

321
00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:34.420
I always love you, Samantha.
