1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,740
Were you at the Robertson Hotel last night?

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:04,160
Robertson Hotel?

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,480
Anyways, you're probably nervous.

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,179
Don't worry, I'll take full responsibility for what happened.

5
00:00:10,179 --> 00:00:13,609
This is a $5 million check.

6
00:00:13,609 --> 00:00:16,210
Acceptance requires signing a non-disclosure agreement.

7
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:19,609
Or you can move into my state and I'll cover all your expenses,

8
00:00:19,609 --> 00:00:23,410
as well as providing you with a $20,000 monthly allowance.

9
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:24,649
We can see where it goes.

10
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:26,690
You must have me confused with Katie,

11
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:29,210
but I can't miss this opportunity.

12
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:32,560
It's karma for her constant looking down on me.

13
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,560
I'll move in tomorrow.

14
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:44,740
What's that for?

15
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:46,780
I'm moving in with my boyfriend.

16
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,140
Boyfriend?

17
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:50,299
Since when did you have a boyfriend?

18
00:00:50,299 --> 00:00:53,700
I didn't want to tell you about it until I knew if it was serious or not.

19
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,030
I'm going to be all alone here.

20
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,649
We all need to grow up eventually.

21
00:01:00,649 --> 00:01:03,640
So tell me about your day.

22
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,280
I got a new job.

23
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,000
They're going to pay me $150k a year.

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,760
Oh my god!

25
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,599
I'm so happy for you.
