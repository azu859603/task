1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:02,509
These are you?

2
00:00:02,509 --> 00:00:06,809
Could you go grab James at that French restaurant

3
00:00:06,809 --> 00:00:08,509
in Broadway?

4
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:10,310
His business dinner there.

5
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:12,609
John is busy running errands for one.

6
00:00:12,609 --> 00:00:16,309
James is a girlfriend, so James has a girlfriend?

7
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:18,410
Not just any girlfriend.

8
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:20,809
She's the first girl to ever move in,

9
00:00:20,809 --> 00:00:22,710
and he's probably going to marry her.

10
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:32,780
Hey, Richard.

11
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:34,979
Oh, I don't even know where to start.

12
00:00:34,979 --> 00:00:38,579
I mean, I got a new job, and the boss is such a jerk.

13
00:00:38,679 --> 00:00:41,280
He has a girlfriend, but he's like sleeping around the whole time.

14
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,280
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.

15
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,280
Slow down.

16
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,679
How do you know he's sleeping around?

17
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:48,079
That was my old boss, actually.

18
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:49,079
No, no, no.

19
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:51,280
My new boss is so great.

20
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,380
He's very good at his job.

21
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,780
Super professional, very talented.

22
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,780
You're not making sense.

23
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:58,679
Wait, is your boss around?

24
00:00:58,679 --> 00:00:59,479
Yeah.

25
00:00:59,479 --> 00:00:59,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

26
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,880
Gotta go.

27
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:08,959
Bye.

28
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:10,659
James, what's up?

29
00:01:10,659 --> 00:01:14,849
Pretty thing.

30
00:01:14,849 --> 00:01:17,650
You shouldn't have sweetened the deal at this, girl.

31
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:18,650
Okay, sure.
