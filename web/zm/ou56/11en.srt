1
00:00:05,299 --> 00:00:08,500
James, I made breakfast.

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,500
Why are you doing this circus show?

3
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,710
It was all past.

4
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:20,859
James, today is Valentine's Day, and I was wondering if you wanted to get dinner together.

5
00:00:21,699 --> 00:00:28,500
No.

6
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,500
So what are you gonna do after work?

7
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:35,979
I'm meeting some friends tonight, some friends, or a friend.

8
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,070
No.

9
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:43,659
Sir, should I get Miss Anna a Valentine's gift on your behalf? Whatever. Make Lindsey do.

10
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,600
Katie, come to my office.

11
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:56,509
He's not gonna ask me to pay for his medical bills, is he?

12
00:00:56,509 --> 00:01:09,430
I need money to pay for your medical bills.

13
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:16,099
What, medical bills?

14
00:01:16,099 --> 00:01:25,280
I can't. He has a girlfriend.

15
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,280
I don't mind if you want to compensate me for that.

16
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,280
No.

17
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,280
No, I forget.

18
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,209
How can I help you?

19
00:01:34,209 --> 00:01:35,370
Come with me.

20
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:39,129
I want to buy something.

21
00:01:39,129 --> 00:01:42,079
Wow.

22
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,620
It's a pleasure to see you.

23
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:47,680
See when your girlfriend makes such a beautiful couple.

24
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,319
Oh, I'm not his girlfriend.

25
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:54,319
I'm sorry, so how can we help you today?

26
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:56,319
I'm here for a purse.

27
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:58,319
Sure, let me show you the latest collection.

28
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:15,300
From the world to the various weather, and we're one of only three couples.

29
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,300
Which one do you prefer?

30
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,370
How do I know?

31
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:21,900
It's a slashery brand.

32
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:28,879
Wrap it up.

33
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:29,879
Give it to her.

34
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:43,000
Isn't it a bit too much to make me carry your girlfriend's stuff?

35
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It's for you.

36
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,800
I can't accept such an expensive gift.

37
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,800
It's not a gift.

38
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,930
Your purse?

39
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:53,930
It was damaged during working hours on company affairs.

40
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:55,930
A driver?

41
00:02:55,930 --> 00:03:00,830
Company compensation.

42
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:14,530
It's a pleasure to finally meet the future Mrs. Thompson.

43
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:22,900
Help me put on my shoes.

44
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:35,530
If you ever need anything, just let me know.

45
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:38,530
And don't forget about me when you become Mrs. Thompson.

46
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:44,150
Thanks, Fox.

47
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:47,150
We should grab a bite before getting back to the office.

48
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:49,860
Sorry, I can't.

49
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,860
I'm meeting a friend tonight.

50
00:03:51,860 --> 00:04:01,580
Paul, meet me at our usual place.

51
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:17,649
What service is that?

52
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:20,060
I really shouldn't be joking with you.

53
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,060
What do you mean?

54
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,100
It's Valentine's Day.

55
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,100
We're fully booked.

56
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,100
Everyone's celebrating couples, friends with benefits.

57
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,100
Circuit Daddy, Circuit Babies.

58
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:31,100
Maybe not married couples, but...

59
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,420
I've got to go.

60
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,800
What?

61
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,139
You've literally arrived two minutes ago.

62
00:04:39,139 --> 00:04:42,139
Remember when chicken wings used to cost 25 cents?

63
00:04:42,139 --> 00:04:48,139
We would spend all of our lemonade sand money on chicken wings and pizza.

64
00:04:48,139 --> 00:04:51,680
Although I never understood why we have to give out anything.

65
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,680
I mean, she never gave us anything.

66
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,680
My cousin.

67
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,680
We were three orphans who found each other.

68
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,680
We're family.

69
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,680
Speaking of family.

70
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,810
Kitty.

71
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:05,910
I want to see you.

72
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:09,540
What?

73
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:13,790
Redo the summary for the toxicology testing clinical trials on micro-rats.

74
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:14,790
Tonight.

75
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:16,920
Why?

76
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,589
John will pick you up in five.

77
00:05:18,589 --> 00:05:21,589
You can work on it at my place.

78
00:05:21,589 --> 00:05:22,589
Oh, sorry.

79
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:24,589
I got to get back to work.

80
00:05:24,589 --> 00:05:26,750
You work for the Nazis?

81
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Miss.

82
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,930
This is Katie, James' new project coordinator.

83
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:47,600
Katie, this is James' girlfriend.

84
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,329
So he likes sexy girls.

85
00:05:51,329 --> 00:05:57,860
Who's your boyfriend mad at you for bitching him on Valentine's Day?

86
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:58,860
Why?

87
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,860
Does it matter to you?

88
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,860
Not at all.

89
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,860
What matters to me is you doing your job.

90
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,430
Yes, sir.

91
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:06,430
Working on it.

92
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:08,879
What's that face?

93
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:10,879
Protesting the overtime work?

94
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:13,550
I like overtime work.

95
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:15,550
Do I get overtime pay?

96
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:16,550
No.

97
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,550
Your position has flexible work hours.

98
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:21,550
You know you'd have finished already if you didn't have a date with your boyfriend.

99
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:24,550
I would have finished already if you stopped asking me questions.

100
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,550
Your job's to answer my questions.

101
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:29,129
I'm sorry for interrupting, sir.

102
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:31,129
But Miss Anna is sick.

103
00:06:31,129 --> 00:06:32,129
You might need to check on her.

104
00:06:32,129 --> 00:06:33,129
It looks serious.

105
00:06:33,129 --> 00:06:57,240
It's just hyper acidity.

106
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,240
Give her some that acid, she'll be fine.

107
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:04,019
James, wait.

108
00:07:04,019 --> 00:07:08,259
Please don't leave.

109
00:07:08,259 --> 00:07:10,259
Can you just stay with me for the night?

110
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:11,259
No.

111
00:07:11,259 --> 00:07:14,259
What was the point of asking me to live here if you're just going to ignore me all the time?

112
00:07:14,259 --> 00:07:16,259
I'm here now, right?

113
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:19,610
Look, you're free to leave at any time.

114
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:22,610
If it's about the money, then just sign the ND. I'll double the amount.

115
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:23,610
It's not.

116
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:27,110
I grew up as an orphan.

117
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:29,110
I was always neglected.

118
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:33,110
And all I've ever wanted is to love somebody.

119
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:35,110
And for them to love me back the same way.

120
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:36,110
And that person's you.

121
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:39,839
Did you change your perfume?

122
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:44,180
It smells weird.

123
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,529
It's not for you.

124
00:07:45,529 --> 00:07:46,879
Are we done here?

125
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,980
I need to work.

126
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:55,199
It is the same perfume Katie wears.

127
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,199
Why didn't it work?

128
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:21,899
Katie sent me the toxicology and clinical trials last night.

129
00:08:21,899 --> 00:08:22,899
Do you want me to fire her?

130
00:08:22,899 --> 00:08:24,899
No, she did well.

131
00:08:25,899 --> 00:08:27,899
With her potential, she might have been so fast.

132
00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:28,899
You want to go?

133
00:08:28,899 --> 00:08:33,889
Let her handle the distribution strategy somewhere.

134
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:35,750
No.

135
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,750
That's surprising.

136
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,750
Why?

137
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:43,179
She's a smart girl.

138
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:45,179
Have you set the contracts to the Ryerson Hotel?

139
00:08:45,179 --> 00:08:47,179
I'm meeting Paul this Tuesday night.

140
00:08:47,179 --> 00:08:49,409
I was going to hand him over personally.

141
00:08:49,409 --> 00:08:51,409
You know what we need for them.

142
00:08:51,409 --> 00:08:52,409
You don't need to be there.

143
00:08:52,409 --> 00:08:54,409
Katie will come to me on that meeting.

144
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:57,409
Just send him the contracts before I meet him.

145
00:08:57,409 --> 00:09:03,909
Your last summary?

146
00:09:03,909 --> 00:09:07,519
I'll provide summaries for marketing.

147
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:12,299
This is a wad.

148
00:09:12,299 --> 00:09:15,299
Oh, that's just how corporate works.

149
00:09:15,299 --> 00:09:25,110
It seems that Katie's our common enemy.

150
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:27,370
Let's work together.

151
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:34,850
You know, I hung out with James on Valentine's Day,

152
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:35,850
midway through.

153
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:36,850
You ditched me.

154
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:37,850
I know.

155
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:40,850
He asked me to work overtime on Valentine's Day.

156
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:43,850
Paul, are we going to keep talking about how bad I am on it?

157
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:44,850
All right.

158
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:45,850
All right.

159
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:46,850
Let's do something fun.

160
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:50,139
Let's play the Never Have I Ever game, right?

161
00:09:50,139 --> 00:09:51,139
All right.

162
00:09:51,139 --> 00:09:52,139
Okay.

163
00:09:52,139 --> 00:09:57,139
So, if I have done something that you have never done,

164
00:09:57,139 --> 00:09:58,139
I'd say?

165
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,139
Yes.

166
00:09:59,139 --> 00:10:00,139
Also.

167
00:10:00,139 --> 00:10:05,799
Never have I ever had a one-night stand.

168
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:10,159
With each other?

169
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:14,929
I never thought you'd be the type of person to have a one-night stand.

170
00:10:14,929 --> 00:10:16,929
And what type of person has a one-night stand?

171
00:10:16,929 --> 00:10:17,929
Deer type?

172
00:10:17,929 --> 00:10:18,990
Mm-hmm.

173
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:19,990
Hello.

174
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:21,990
Could we continue with the game, please?

175
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:22,990
Your turn.

176
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:26,980
Never have I ever been to Europe.

177
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:38,720
Never have I ever fallen in love.

178
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,720
Really?

179
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:48,460
Never?

180
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:49,460
What have you been all this use?

181
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,009
Ah.

182
00:10:51,009 --> 00:10:52,649
See you've been in love.

183
00:10:52,649 --> 00:10:53,649
See you've been in love.

184
00:10:53,649 --> 00:10:57,179
As tens.

185
00:10:57,179 --> 00:11:01,940
Why are you so curious about my life?

186
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:02,940
Lots.

187
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:03,940
My turn.

188
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:09,179
How have I ever...

189
00:11:09,179 --> 00:11:21,039
Such a somebody while I was drunk.

190
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:22,039
Okay.

191
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:24,100
Okay.

192
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:30,769
I'll take it.

193
00:11:30,769 --> 00:11:31,769
I'll take it.

194
00:11:31,769 --> 00:11:46,529
I got it too many.

195
00:11:46,529 --> 00:11:48,529
I think I got it too many.

196
00:11:48,529 --> 00:11:52,580
Let me stay here tonight.

197
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:58,470
All right.

198
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:10,100
Two.

199
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:15,929
We're joining.

200
00:12:15,929 --> 00:12:16,929
Where have you been?

201
00:12:16,929 --> 00:12:24,210
Where have you been all this time?

202
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:33,320
What are you talking about?

203
00:12:33,320 --> 00:13:00,750
Oh, fuck.

204
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:01,750
Did we do it again?

205
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:12,580
If we...

206
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:19,639
If we did anything inappropriate last night,

207
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:21,899
could we just forget about it?

208
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:24,899
I assume it was just from the alcohol last night.

209
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:29,360
Well, what happened last night?

210
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,360
Do you really not remember what you did to me?

211
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:38,120
Then last night.

212
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,820
Do you really not remember what you did to me?

213
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:52,169
Why is the room spinning?

214
00:13:52,169 --> 00:13:53,169
I don't know.

215
00:13:53,169 --> 00:14:10,620
I'll buy you a new one.

216
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,620
It'll cost you a month in your shower.

217
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,740
In that case.

218
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:19,720
I will get it cloned for you.

219
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,720
There's no need.

220
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,820
John will bring us both in your set.

221
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,549
You should be here in a minute.

222
00:14:25,549 --> 00:14:27,549
Take a shower here and for one.

223
00:14:27,549 --> 00:14:35,539
I saw Katie and James get out of the same car today.

224
00:14:35,539 --> 00:14:37,539
Do you think they're dating?

225
00:14:37,539 --> 00:14:38,539
I don't know.

226
00:14:38,539 --> 00:14:44,509
But she might replace Lindsay.

227
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:46,509
You had a gossip all day?

228
00:14:46,509 --> 00:14:47,509
Lindsay!

229
00:14:47,509 --> 00:14:49,509
We were just saying that no matter what Katie does,

230
00:14:49,509 --> 00:14:51,509
she'll never replace you.

231
00:14:51,509 --> 00:14:52,509
Absolutely.

232
00:14:52,509 --> 00:14:54,509
I mean, James even asked you to handle the product lunch.

233
00:14:54,509 --> 00:14:57,509
That's like the most important company of it in years.

234
00:14:57,509 --> 00:15:02,019
And how are the preparations for the product lunch conference?

235
00:15:02,019 --> 00:15:03,059
Huh?

236
00:15:03,059 --> 00:15:15,809
Katie fired.

237
00:15:15,809 --> 00:15:21,139
Comes to the product lunch.

238
00:15:21,139 --> 00:15:22,139
Lunch is here.

239
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:23,299
Ready?

240
00:15:23,299 --> 00:15:24,299
Hopefully it's so hot.

241
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:26,299
We can eat before everything starts.

242
00:15:26,299 --> 00:15:27,299
You get chicken?

243
00:15:27,299 --> 00:15:28,299
Yes.

244
00:15:28,299 --> 00:15:33,580
Okay.

245
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:34,580
Coming together.

246
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,580
Looks nice.

247
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:36,580
Did you get the chicken?

248
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:37,580
Yes.

249
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,580
Yeah.

250
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:39,580
Okay.

251
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,100
I'm just going to leave the rest of those right there.

252
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:47,309
Let's go.

253
00:15:47,309 --> 00:15:48,309
Hi Lindsay.

254
00:15:48,309 --> 00:15:49,309
I got your lunch.

255
00:15:49,309 --> 00:15:51,309
And I just wanted to say good luck on this speech.

256
00:15:51,309 --> 00:15:52,309
Today I'll don't disturb me.

257
00:15:52,309 --> 00:15:53,759
Okay.

258
00:15:53,759 --> 00:16:01,350
Everything's done.

259
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:02,350
I'll let you cream.

260
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:03,350
Mr. Thompson.

261
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:04,350
Lindsay needs help.

262
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:24,100
She can't breathe.

263
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:27,519
Who was in charge of the lunches?

264
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,519
You'll be able to breathe normally in a few minutes.

265
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,519
I actually have that allergy too.

266
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:32,519
How could this happen?

267
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:33,519
You do these on me.

268
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:34,519
I am so sorry.

269
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:36,519
I reminded the restaurant twice.

270
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:38,519
Lindsay can't give the opening speech now.

271
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:39,519
What do we do?

272
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:40,519
Maybe.

273
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:41,679
Katie?

274
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:42,679
Can you do it?

275
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:43,679
Me?

276
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:47,879
I believe you can do it.

277
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:48,879
Yeah.

278
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:49,879
Okay.

279
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:50,879
I'll try my best.

280
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:51,879
Alright.

281
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:52,879
Get her dressed and ready for the opening.

282
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:53,879
Okay.

283
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:54,879
Get her.

284
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:55,879
Oh.

285
00:16:55,879 --> 00:16:56,879
Okay.

286
00:16:56,879 --> 00:16:57,879
Give me a dress and makeup.

287
00:16:57,879 --> 00:17:23,099
I need hair now.

288
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:24,099
Why hasn't it started yet?

289
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:27,359
I've never seen you so nervous before.

290
00:17:27,359 --> 00:18:49,000
Ladies and gentlemen, colleagues, esteemed guests, and valued customers.

291
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,539
I'm thrilled to welcome you to the launch of our newest pharmaceutical innovation.

292
00:18:54,539 --> 00:18:59,990
She has a boyfriend.

293
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:02,079
Why do you come here?

294
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:04,750
Mr. She can't worry about your employees.

295
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:05,750
I'll ask myself.

296
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:10,160
I have the funniest thing I'll find away from around.

297
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,160
Especially you.

298
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:20,049
Throughout Thompson's pharmaceutical's 70-year history, we've always believed in empowering patients through breakthrough solutions.

299
00:19:21,049 --> 00:19:22,049
That's beautiful.

300
00:19:22,049 --> 00:19:23,049
What?

301
00:19:23,049 --> 00:19:25,049
That's not the speech I approve.

302
00:19:25,049 --> 00:19:31,049
Our products reflect our steadfast commitment to making a positive impact on the world.

303
00:19:31,049 --> 00:19:40,579
Inclusion, join us as we embark on a new era in healthcare.

304
00:19:40,579 --> 00:20:05,710
Let's push boundaries and create a healthier, brighter future for all.

305
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:06,710
You look beautiful today.

306
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:08,779
You should look like that more often.

307
00:20:08,779 --> 00:20:14,750
If I dress like this over day, won't I get fired?

308
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,750
I only fire people for their work.

309
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:17,750
Not how they look.

310
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,750
That was an amazing speech.

311
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:20,750
Do you freelance?

312
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:21,750
We have your Insta.

313
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,750
I don't know my phone with me.

314
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,750
Oh, what about what's happened?

315
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,750
Because this is more professional context.

316
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:31,750
We're currently drafting our contract.

317
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:36,750
She gives speeches for us exclusively in her new salaries 20,000 a month.

318
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,230
Oh my gosh.

319
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:39,230
Sorry, Katie.

320
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:45,230
I'm going to have to work 10 times harder to hopefully be able to afford to hire you in the near future.

321
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:46,230
You can forget it.

322
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:54,000
Because I'm not going to give you that opportunity.

323
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
There is no speech?

324
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Yeah.

325
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
So, we had to improvise.

326
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Wow.

327
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:19,180
We're even more impressed.

328
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:21,180
Why does she smell so familiar?

329
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:23,500
Can it be?

330
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,500
Sorry.

331
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:32,240
Are you at the Robertson Hotel on February 11th?

332
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,809
What's wrong? Are you all right?

333
00:21:35,809 --> 00:21:36,809
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

334
00:21:36,809 --> 00:21:38,809
I'm fine. I just need to use the bathroom.

335
00:21:38,809 --> 00:21:47,420
Check the surveillance footage of the Robertson Hotel on February 11th.

336
00:21:47,420 --> 00:22:05,549
I need to be sure who she was.

337
00:22:05,549 --> 00:22:08,619
Lindsey, how long have you been serving this company?

338
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:09,619
Ten years?

339
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:10,619
Yes.

340
00:22:10,619 --> 00:22:12,619
Ten years and 28 days.

341
00:22:12,619 --> 00:22:21,859
I'm looking forward to the next decade.

342
00:22:21,859 --> 00:22:29,059
Then why did you try to set up Katie at the risk of ruining our product launch?

343
00:22:29,059 --> 00:22:34,650
Uh, I don't understand.

344
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:36,650
Then why is the speech page blank?

345
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:41,650
I know for a fact that you of all people would never make such a foolish mistake.

346
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:45,630
You should have known better.

347
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:52,579
It wasn't an honest mistake. I promise it will never happen again.

348
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:53,579
I will never do this again.

349
00:22:53,579 --> 00:22:54,579
It better not.

350
00:22:54,579 --> 00:22:57,829
Because if it does, I won't let you off the hook easily.

351
00:22:57,829 --> 00:23:01,019
And never ever put your little schemes on Kate.

352
00:23:01,019 --> 00:23:03,500
Be nice to her.

353
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:07,380
You can go now.

354
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:17,670
Congratulations, Katie.

355
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:20,220
You are pregnant.

356
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,019
Take care of yourself.

357
00:23:22,019 --> 00:23:24,019
No drinking or smoking.

358
00:23:24,019 --> 00:23:31,150
Prescribing a special course of prenatal vitamins and rules for you.

359
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:32,150
Nothing too dress.

360
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:59,339
It's not helping to keep you healthy.

361
00:23:59,339 --> 00:24:16,789
They're there for us.

362
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:18,819
They're okay.

363
00:24:18,819 --> 00:24:29,809
These are for you, by the way.

364
00:24:29,809 --> 00:24:30,809
Richard, what do you mean?

365
00:24:30,809 --> 00:24:35,980
I should have sat this a long time ago, Katie.

366
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:37,980
Here we go.

367
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:41,140
I want to spend every night like this with you.

368
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:44,900
Will you let me take care of you?

369
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:54,009
But I'm pregnant.

370
00:24:54,009 --> 00:24:55,009
I'm pregnant.

371
00:24:55,009 --> 00:25:11,589
Oh, it's...

372
00:25:11,589 --> 00:25:17,049
How long did you have a boyfriend?

373
00:25:17,049 --> 00:25:20,170
I don't have a boyfriend.

374
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:23,420
So, I don't understand. What do you mean then?

375
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:24,420
I don't know.

376
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:30,619
All I can think of is I want to give this baby a good family and a proper home.

377
00:25:30,619 --> 00:25:37,779
Katie, I know this might be very hard to talk about.

378
00:25:37,779 --> 00:25:40,009
Did you get raped?

379
00:25:40,009 --> 00:25:41,009
No.

380
00:25:41,009 --> 00:25:43,009
If you did, it's completely fine.

381
00:25:43,009 --> 00:25:44,009
No.

382
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:45,009
No.

383
00:25:45,009 --> 00:25:46,009
No, no, no.

384
00:25:46,009 --> 00:25:47,009
It's nothing like that.

385
00:25:47,009 --> 00:25:51,160
But I did kind of take advantage of him.

386
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:54,160
It was all my fault. I initiated it.
