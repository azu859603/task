Lindsay? James got hurt. If someone attacked us, he hit his head really bad.

2
00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.660
Wait, what? Slow down. Why are you with James?

3
00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:32.820
He followed me to the location. I told him not to, but he still came. I feel horrible.

4
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:40.859
Stay calm. Just text me where you are. I'm sending John over.

5
00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:46.859
Please make it for James. You're going to be a father soon. I want to spend more time with you.

6
00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:56.869
Doctor? How is he?

7
00:00:56.869 --> 00:01:00.219
I'm sorry. We did everything that we could.

8
00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:11.959
I'm sorry. I was so angry with you.

9
00:01:11.959 --> 00:01:18.030
James, please don't do this.

10
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.269
James.
