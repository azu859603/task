1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
You're pregnant. You know who the father is.

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:06,450
You have a girlfriend and you're still flirting around.

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:08,449
Do you even know what you're talking about?

4
00:00:08,449 --> 00:00:09,449
Of course I do.

5
00:00:09,449 --> 00:00:12,449
You know what? I quit.

6
00:00:12,449 --> 00:00:39,979
Lindsay? Good news, ma'am.

7
00:00:39,979 --> 00:00:41,979
Katie, quit.

8
00:00:41,979 --> 00:00:44,689
Really? That's great.

9
00:00:44,689 --> 00:00:47,689
Guess what? James found out Katie's pregnant.

10
00:00:47,689 --> 00:00:50,070
And they had a big fight.

11
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:53,070
Hey, so you're saying that James knows Katie's pregnant.

12
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,070
Exactly.

13
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:56,490
I don't think she'll ever be coming back.

14
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,490
Lindsay, I need you to do something for me.

15
00:00:58,490 --> 00:00:59,490
Anything for you.

16
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:04,489
I need you to get me something strong enough to kill her unborn child.

17
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:06,579
I'm gonna go visit my best friend.
