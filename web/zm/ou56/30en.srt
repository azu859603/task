1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,179
Really?

2
00:00:01,179 --> 00:00:03,180
You're choosing him over me.

3
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:04,179
That's not your business.

4
00:00:04,179 --> 00:00:06,179
Maybe I didn't come here to fight.

5
00:00:06,179 --> 00:00:08,179
I have to tell you something.

6
00:00:08,179 --> 00:00:09,179
You heard her.

7
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:21,620
You know, you really didn't have to do that.

8
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:22,620
It's okay.

9
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:23,620
Don't worry about it.

10
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:27,160
I wanted to punch this jerk for a long time.

11
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:33,399
Look, you have been so kind to me.

12
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:37,399
And I have always seen you as family.

13
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:39,039
Yeah.

14
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,320
Flowey can be a real family.

15
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,320
Um, no.

16
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:50,380
I mean, I only see you as my brother.

17
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:57,259
You deserve someone who wholeheartedly loves you.

18
00:00:57,259 --> 00:01:00,259
And I'm not that person.

19
00:01:00,259 --> 00:01:02,649
I'm so sorry.
