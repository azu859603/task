1
00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.129
James is drunk. I wouldn't wait up if I were you.

2
00:00:03.129 --> 00:00:05.129
What? He's drunk?

3
00:00:05.129 --> 00:00:07.129
Well, where is he? I'll pick him up.

4
00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:09.130
Sorry. I can't tell you that without his consent.

5
00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.730
Oh, and he's drunk, so how can you even get his consent?

6
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.230
Stop wasting my time. Just tell me where he is.

7
00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.230
Alright. We're at.

8
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.039
John, is James inside? Is he okay?

9
00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.300
John, is James okay?

10
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.300
Anna?

11
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.910
Anna, what are you doing here?

12
00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.910
Hey, this is James's girlfriend.

13
00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.410
I believe I introduced you all at James's house.

14
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:40.490
Miss, this is Katie, James's new project coordinator.

15
00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:44.070
Katie, this is James's girlfriend.

16
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.140
So he likes sexy girls.

17
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.969
I believe I introduced you all at James's house.

18
00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:59.820
How do you even know James?

19
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.820
You knew Katie, I can explain everything.

20
00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.819
I didn't mean to hide this from you, Katie.

21
00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:08.819
I never even planned on dating someone like James.

22
00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:11.819
And I was going to tell you after this all blew over.

23
00:01:11.819 --> 00:01:14.819
Still, you didn't mention his name even once.

24
00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:16.819
Aren't we best friends?

25
00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:20.209
If that's how you really feel, I should check on James.

26
00:01:20.209 --> 00:01:22.209
No, please don't. I'm thanking you. Please.

27
00:01:22.209 --> 00:01:23.209
Move.

28
00:01:23.209 --> 00:01:25.430
James is my boyfriend now.

29
00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.430
Stay away from my man.

30
00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:28.430
You're mad.

31
00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.430
You mean the man you stole from me?

32
00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.430
Katie, you're beautiful.

33
00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.430
And well-educated.

34
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.430
You could have someone better.

35
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.489
Can't you just let me have James?

36
00:01:40.489 --> 00:01:42.489
I saved your life.

37
00:01:43.489 --> 00:01:45.489
You promised to give me anything I wanted.

38
00:01:45.489 --> 00:01:47.780
I can't decide that for James.

39
00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:58.769
James!

40
00:01:58.769 --> 00:02:00.769
What are you doing here?

41
00:02:00.769 --> 00:02:05.290
James!

42
00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:06.290
And?

43
00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.319
What are you doing here?

44
00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:15.620
John, get the car!

45
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.189
Now that the baby's gone, you're missing.

46
00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:23.949
Being in there, Katie.

47
00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:24.949
Paul was right.

48
00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:26.949
If you love someone, their past doesn't matter.

49
00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:29.370
I don't care who the father is.

50
00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.370
I won't let anything happen to you or the baby.

51
00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.819
I'll treat the baby as my own.

52
00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:35.819
I swear.

53
00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:36.819
I'll get you the best doctors.

54
00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:37.819
John, drive faster.

55
00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:38.819
Yes, sir.

56
00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.159
Help.

57
00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:44.219
Someone help me help.

58
00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:45.219
Katie.

59
00:02:45.219 --> 00:02:46.219
Katie.

60
00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:47.219
Helen.

61
00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:48.219
Katie.

62
00:02:48.219 --> 00:02:54.430
Katie.

63
00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:55.430
How did it go?

64
00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:56.430
Do you need me to pick you up?

65
00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:57.430
It's me.

66
00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.009
Listen.

67
00:02:59.009 --> 00:03:06.419
I was poisoned.

68
00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:09.580
We found excessive traces of methyl mercury in her blood work.

69
00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:16.050
If the levels had been much higher, you and your baby would have been in grave danger.

70
00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.050
How do I have methyl mercury in my blood?

71
00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:20.050
Because of this.

72
00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.939
Richard found it in your apartment.

73
00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:27.939
He asked me to look for anything suspicious in your apartment.

74
00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:29.939
I mean, this is kind of new.

75
00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:32.939
We tested it and we found methyl mercury in the pills.

76
00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:37.650
Whatever pills were originally in this bottle, they'd been replaced.

77
00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.789
Where did you get these pills?

78
00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:45.199
Anna gave them to me.

79
00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:46.199
Anna?

80
00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:47.199
Why would she do this?

81
00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:49.199
This is the baby mine.

82
00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:57.979
Tell me the truth, please.

83
00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:58.979
What does it matter?

84
00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:59.979
You're together with Anna.

85
00:03:59.979 --> 00:04:01.979
Just go back to her.

86
00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:02.979
What?

87
00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:03.979
These were that too?

88
00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:06.300
You fucking jerk.

89
00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:07.300
Anna means nothing to me.

90
00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:08.300
I don't even like her.

91
00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.300
You don't even like her.

92
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.300
You're living together.

93
00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.560
Katie.

94
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.779
Think about it.

95
00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:23.779
That night at the Robertson Hotel, did you drop Anna's resume in the room?

96
00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:24.779
Resume.

97
00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:27.480
Maybe?

98
00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.480
When I saw her resume, I thought that I spent the night with her.

99
00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.480
When I confronted her about it, she didn't deny it.

100
00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.480
But I swear, I have not touched her since she moved in.

101
00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:41.240
So Anna's been pretending to be Katie from the beginning.

102
00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.240
It was Anna.

103
00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.660
I can't believe it.

104
00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:48.680
She saved my life once, didn't she?

105
00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.279
Katie, there's something I didn't tell me.

106
00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:54.279
Katie, wake up.

107
00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:56.850
Come in here.

108
00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:58.420
What happened?

109
00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.420
She passed out in the shower.

110
00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:03.100
Don't tell her I was here.

111
00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:04.100
Why?

112
00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.100
I don't want her to know that I saw her naked.

113
00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.189
Promise you will never tell.

114
00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:11.189
Okay.

115
00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:12.189
I promise.

116
00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:14.149
Don't worry.

117
00:05:14.149 --> 00:05:23.829
So Anna never saved my life or saw me as family.

118
00:05:23.829 --> 00:05:28.959
Listen, Katie, no matter what you do, I'll always be by your side.

119
00:05:28.959 --> 00:05:31.759
I'll always be a part of your family.

120
00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:33.759
That was you.

121
00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:34.759
That night.

122
00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:40.509
That's why you have such a familiar sin.

123
00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:43.509
Am I going to be a father?

124
00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:45.509
I know you don't like kids.

125
00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:47.509
I'll raise it myself.

126
00:05:47.509 --> 00:05:49.509
Katie, my offer still stands.

127
00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:51.509
I'll take care of you and the baby.

128
00:05:51.509 --> 00:05:52.509
No, that's not necessary.

129
00:05:52.509 --> 00:05:55.699
I'll look after them both myself.

130
00:05:55.699 --> 00:06:03.860
Katie, I never thought of having kids at my work.

131
00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:08.860
But now that I have this child with you, I feel genuinely blessed.

132
00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:10.860
Please, let me take care of both of you.

133
00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:11.860
Okay?

134
00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.060
Do you really want this?

135
00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:15.439
I do.

136
00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:17.889
I really do.

137
00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:20.370
Give me the chance to prove it to you.

138
00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:21.500
Okay.

139
00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:43.759
And I think Anna might be behind more things than that.

140
00:06:43.759 --> 00:06:44.759
What do you mean?

141
00:06:44.759 --> 00:06:46.920
Remember we got attacked last time.

142
00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:49.040
That was Anna?

143
00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.040
Exactly.

144
00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:55.709
But how did she know where and when I had a business fee?

145
00:06:55.709 --> 00:06:59.310
She had an insider.

146
00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:01.310
But we have no evidence.

147
00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:02.310
Don't worry.

148
00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:03.439
I'll handle it.

149
00:07:03.439 --> 00:07:05.600
What are you gonna do?

150
00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.949
She tried to murder you and her baby.

151
00:07:07.949 --> 00:07:08.949
I won her dead.

152
00:07:08.949 --> 00:07:10.949
That is not necessary.

153
00:07:11.949 --> 00:07:13.949
I have a plan.

154
00:07:13.949 --> 00:07:18.230
All you need to do, put on an act.

155
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:30.750
What?

156
00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:32.750
Whatever you want to ask, I have no answer for you.

157
00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:35.199
You knew Katie before?

158
00:07:35.199 --> 00:07:38.199
Why didn't you tell me she was carrying someone else's baby?

159
00:07:38.199 --> 00:07:47.629
Could you let her deceive me for so long?

160
00:07:47.629 --> 00:07:49.629
James, he really liked her.

161
00:07:49.629 --> 00:07:51.860
And that's why I didn't want to say anything.

162
00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:54.560
I did have feelings for her.

163
00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:57.560
But she sleeps with so many other people.

164
00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:00.100
She doesn't even know who's child she's carrying.

165
00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:02.100
It's disgusting.

166
00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:03.100
Unlike you.

167
00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:04.100
You're pure.

168
00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:06.990
Obedient.

169
00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:09.879
Anna.

170
00:08:09.879 --> 00:08:14.889
I've been neglecting you.

171
00:08:14.889 --> 00:08:17.519
Shall we start again?

172
00:08:17.519 --> 00:08:18.519
Yes.

173
00:08:18.519 --> 00:08:26.439
You're gonna be marrying into our family?

174
00:08:26.439 --> 00:08:28.439
You should learn about the family business.

175
00:08:28.439 --> 00:08:31.660
I'll have John arrange a position for you in the company.

176
00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:32.659
You're gonna start tomorrow.

177
00:08:32.659 --> 00:08:33.659
How's that sound?

178
00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:35.820
Oh, maybe when you're into the family, that sounds great.

179
00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:37.820
Well, I have work to do.

180
00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:40.049
Don't wait up.

181
00:08:40.049 --> 00:08:42.429
John will pick you up tomorrow.

182
00:08:42.429 --> 00:08:43.820
Okay.

183
00:08:43.820 --> 00:09:06.669
Can I get you anything?

184
00:09:06.669 --> 00:09:07.669
A coffee?

185
00:09:07.669 --> 00:09:08.669
I can go make you one.

186
00:09:08.669 --> 00:09:14.539
I want her to make it.

187
00:09:14.539 --> 00:09:18.580
Me?

188
00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:20.289
Yes.

189
00:09:20.289 --> 00:09:21.289
You.

190
00:09:21.289 --> 00:09:28.820
It's just such a pleasure to have you here.

191
00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:29.820
Here you go.

192
00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:31.840
Actually, you know what?

193
00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:32.840
I changed my mind.

194
00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:33.840
I want tea.

195
00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:37.440
What are you waiting for?

196
00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:47.820
Go on.

197
00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:48.820
Alright.

198
00:09:48.820 --> 00:10:21.639
I need to be marrying James.

199
00:10:21.639 --> 00:10:23.059
I will be...

200
00:10:23.059 --> 00:10:25.019
Not you.

201
00:10:25.019 --> 00:10:26.080
Congratulations.

202
00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:28.080
You're finally getting what you wanted.

203
00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:32.909
I know James liked you in the past, but that's over now.

204
00:10:32.909 --> 00:10:33.909
Know your place?

205
00:10:33.909 --> 00:10:35.909
Stay out of my way.

206
00:10:35.909 --> 00:10:36.909
Why are you laughing?

207
00:10:36.909 --> 00:10:40.980
Nothing.

208
00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:44.879
James and I have set our boundaries.

209
00:10:44.879 --> 00:10:48.100
I'm just here to work, so you two can do whatever you want.

210
00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:49.100
Just leave me alone.

211
00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:50.100
Oh, you know what?

212
00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:54.100
I'll be too busy enjoying my life with James to notice a little life at you anyway.

213
00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:56.100
Someone's in trouble again.

214
00:10:56.100 --> 00:11:29.860
I can't wait to tell everyone we're together.

215
00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:31.860
You haven't found the insider yet.

216
00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:33.919
You have to hold out a little bit longer.

217
00:11:33.919 --> 00:11:35.919
Actually, I think I found a suspect.

218
00:11:35.919 --> 00:11:38.899
Me too.

219
00:11:38.899 --> 00:11:41.610
Who's on your mind?

220
00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:44.120
Lindsay and Anna seem too close.

221
00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:47.120
They don't seem like the new acquaintance of her.

222
00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:48.120
Exactly.

223
00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:51.279
And she replaced her speech during the product launch.

224
00:11:51.279 --> 00:11:53.279
We need to keep an eye on her.

225
00:11:53.279 --> 00:11:55.539
Don't forget about our date tonight.

226
00:11:55.539 --> 00:11:58.500
Our very first date.

227
00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:01.190
Who wrote this report?

228
00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:02.190
A three-year-old?

229
00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:14.269
Sorry, I'll redo that right now.

230
00:12:14.269 --> 00:12:16.710
Katie?

231
00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:17.710
This is for you.

232
00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:26.330
Maybe my girlfriend?

233
00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:27.330
Yes.

234
00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:29.159
It's beautiful.

235
00:12:29.159 --> 00:12:34.990
Thank you.

236
00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:38.299
Take a look at the backup.

237
00:12:38.299 --> 00:12:40.350
Partnerships.

238
00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:41.350
Yeah.

239
00:12:41.350 --> 00:13:06.860
J. and K.

240
00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:10.240
If we have a boy, we can call him Jack.

241
00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:15.740
And if we have a girl, Jack.

242
00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:29.940
Are you getting ahead of yourself?

243
00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:33.190
Are you asking me out or asking me to marry you?

244
00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:35.190
That too will come.

245
00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:38.220
By the way, our plan is good to go.

246
00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:39.480
Are you ready for it?

247
00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:52.490
You're fired.

248
00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:54.220
What?

249
00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:55.220
Why?

250
00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:56.220
You offended Anna.

251
00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:57.220
That's why.

252
00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:59.220
No, no, that's impossible.

253
00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:00.220
I...

254
00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:04.789
Go to HR and collect your final paycheck.

255
00:14:04.789 --> 00:14:05.789
John?

256
00:14:05.789 --> 00:14:28.110
Now that you're going to become Mrs. Thompson,

257
00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:29.110
you're just going to cut me out.

258
00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:30.110
What are you talking about?

259
00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:31.110
Are you out of your mind?

260
00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:32.110
Am I?

261
00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:34.110
James just fired me!

262
00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:35.750
Yeah.

263
00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:36.750
Because I offended you.

264
00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:38.750
Who do you think you are?

265
00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:41.750
You were the one who ordered someone to feel guilty.

266
00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:44.750
And you're the one who told me to get those important bills to tell her, baby.

267
00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:45.750
I'm going down.

268
00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:46.750
You're going to shut me up.

269
00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:47.750
If it's poked down.

270
00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:49.750
Oh, you're going to need it?

271
00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:52.000
It's right here.

272
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.259
I must be some sort of misunderstanding.

273
00:14:54.259 --> 00:14:55.259
I'll talk to James.

274
00:14:55.259 --> 00:14:56.259
Get your job back first, all right?

275
00:14:56.259 --> 00:14:57.259
Yeah.

276
00:14:57.259 --> 00:14:58.259
You better.

277
00:14:58.259 --> 00:14:59.259
Because if I'm fired,

278
00:14:59.259 --> 00:15:01.259
then it's both going down.

279
00:15:01.259 --> 00:15:13.460
Don't hurt, baby.

280
00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:14.460
It was shut up.

281
00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:16.460
We have the evidence now.

282
00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:17.460
Should we call the police?

283
00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:20.710
I don't want to let them off the hook so easily.

284
00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:23.929
What do you have in mind?

285
00:15:23.929 --> 00:15:25.929
They like to be in the spotlight, right?

286
00:15:25.929 --> 00:15:30.240
Then I'll give them a moment they'll never forget.

287
00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:37.009
I heard you fired Lindsay.

288
00:15:37.009 --> 00:15:41.029
She's been with this company for ten years.

289
00:15:41.029 --> 00:15:43.029
She isolated you in the company.

290
00:15:43.029 --> 00:15:44.029
That's why I fired her.

291
00:15:44.029 --> 00:15:45.029
For you.

292
00:15:45.029 --> 00:15:47.029
Isolated me.

293
00:15:47.029 --> 00:15:49.029
And she didn't give you any work.

294
00:15:49.029 --> 00:15:52.029
And she prevented anyone from interacting with you.

295
00:15:52.029 --> 00:15:55.029
James, Lindsay was just trying to prevent me from overworking.

296
00:15:55.029 --> 00:15:57.029
I'm new to the company.

297
00:15:57.029 --> 00:15:59.029
If you fire, Lindsay, I wonder if anyone would have talked to.

298
00:15:59.029 --> 00:16:01.029
So you want her back?

299
00:16:01.029 --> 00:16:04.909
Okay.

300
00:16:04.909 --> 00:16:09.950
It's up to you.

301
00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:13.950
By the way, our company is holding its annual conference next week.

302
00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:15.950
I'd like to introduce you as my fiance.

303
00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:16.980
What do you think?

304
00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:23.370
Fiance, really?

305
00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:24.370
Of course.

306
00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:27.370
I've been waiting for this day to come a long time.

307
00:16:27.370 --> 00:16:35.129
The conference is in just a few days.

308
00:16:35.129 --> 00:16:37.669
Get yourself ready.

309
00:16:37.669 --> 00:16:40.110
We'll do.

310
00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:55.269
The report is all aligned by that side.

311
00:16:55.269 --> 00:16:57.269
As to instructions.

312
00:16:57.269 --> 00:17:03.980
Tomorrow, you'll be in the headlines.

313
00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:06.210
Amanda's about to start.

314
00:17:06.210 --> 00:17:19.019
Shall we?

315
00:17:19.019 --> 00:17:20.019
Please.

316
00:17:20.019 --> 00:17:34.259
Jess.

317
00:17:34.259 --> 00:17:41.150
We're doing here.

318
00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:43.150
I'm here to attend this event as an employee.

319
00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:44.150
They're in a show.

320
00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:46.150
This is Anna's big day.

321
00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:47.150
What are you wearing?

322
00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:49.150
Are you trying to steal her spotlight?

323
00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:50.150
Exactly.

324
00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:52.150
I'm here to steal the spotlight.

325
00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:53.789
Careful.

326
00:17:53.789 --> 00:17:55.789
Everybody's watching.

327
00:17:55.789 --> 00:17:58.619
James is here.

328
00:17:58.619 --> 00:18:25.779
Welcome to our company's annual conference.

329
00:18:25.779 --> 00:18:30.230
Before we start, there's something I'd like to share tonight.

330
00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:34.160
I'd like to introduce my beautiful girlfriends, everyone.

331
00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:46.059
I'd like to introduce my beautiful girlfriends, everyone.

332
00:18:46.059 --> 00:18:49.170
Katie.

333
00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:56.059
Yes, we are.

334
00:18:56.059 --> 00:18:59.660
What's going on?

335
00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:00.660
James, what are you talking about?

336
00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:03.660
You said you were going to announce me as your fiance.

337
00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:04.660
Oh, that's right.

338
00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:05.660
I almost forgot.

339
00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:07.660
We are announcing something tonight.

340
00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:12.660
And that is that you, Anna, are an attempted murderer.

341
00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:31.470
You are the one who told me to get those abortion pills.

342
00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:33.950
No, who took this video?

343
00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:40.119
Whoa, that is breaking news.

344
00:19:40.119 --> 00:19:41.119
Try to fold down.

345
00:19:41.119 --> 00:19:45.480
Oh, stop it, stop.

346
00:19:45.480 --> 00:20:01.259
What are you filming?

347
00:20:01.259 --> 00:20:02.259
Stop filming.

348
00:20:02.259 --> 00:20:03.259
What are you doing?

349
00:20:03.259 --> 00:20:04.259
Security.

350
00:20:04.259 --> 00:20:05.259
Take them away.

351
00:20:05.259 --> 00:20:16.660
Stop recording.

352
00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:18.980
I'm finally realizing what's been going on.

353
00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:20.980
Anna, you deceived me.

354
00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:22.980
And you tried to kill Katie.

355
00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:25.079
Thank God her and the baby are okay.

356
00:20:25.079 --> 00:20:26.079
The baby's okay.

357
00:20:26.079 --> 00:20:29.529
You know, how can that be your lying to me?

358
00:20:29.529 --> 00:20:31.529
I saw her take the abortion pill.

359
00:20:31.529 --> 00:20:33.619
That baby could not have survived.

360
00:20:33.619 --> 00:20:36.619
You should feel lucky the baby survived.

361
00:20:36.619 --> 00:20:39.619
If it hadn't, you wouldn't be going to jail today.

362
00:20:39.619 --> 00:20:41.690
You'd be going straight to hell.

363
00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:43.359
Katie.

364
00:20:43.359 --> 00:20:45.359
Katie, I'm your best friend.

365
00:20:45.359 --> 00:20:47.359
You wouldn't send your best friend to jail, would you?

366
00:20:47.359 --> 00:20:48.359
Wait.

367
00:20:48.359 --> 00:20:54.619
Remember we grew up together?

368
00:20:54.619 --> 00:20:55.619
Right?

369
00:20:55.619 --> 00:20:57.619
You didn't have his sisters.

370
00:20:57.619 --> 00:20:58.619
And I don't remember.

371
00:20:58.619 --> 00:21:00.619
I saved your life once.

372
00:21:00.619 --> 00:21:01.619
How dare you to bring that up?

373
00:21:01.619 --> 00:21:02.619
You didn't save me.

374
00:21:02.619 --> 00:21:06.539
It wasn't my fault.

375
00:21:06.539 --> 00:21:08.539
It was Richards.

376
00:21:08.539 --> 00:21:11.539
He saved you when you wanted me to take the credit.

377
00:21:11.539 --> 00:21:13.539
He didn't want you to know that he loved you.

378
00:21:13.539 --> 00:21:16.539
I was just doing him a favor.

379
00:21:16.539 --> 00:21:19.539
How dare you blame Richards for your schemes?

380
00:21:19.539 --> 00:21:28.099
What have I done wrong?

381
00:21:28.099 --> 00:21:30.319
Pursue the life I wanted?

382
00:21:30.319 --> 00:21:32.769
What's wrong with that?

383
00:21:32.769 --> 00:21:34.769
You always pretended to be my best friend,

384
00:21:34.769 --> 00:21:36.769
just a sidekick to you.

385
00:21:36.769 --> 00:21:38.930
Ever since we were young.

386
00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:40.930
Everyone has left you more.

387
00:21:40.930 --> 00:21:41.930
Wanted to be around you more.

388
00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:42.930
I was invisible.

389
00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:46.930
You used me to showcase how much better you were.

390
00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:49.440
You're a heartless bitch.

391
00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:54.900
Is that how you've always seen me, Anna?

392
00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:58.900
You've always said I had a better job, a better education.

393
00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:01.970
Have you ever considered how hard I worked for that?

394
00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:05.970
Where were you when Richard and I spent hours every day and

395
00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:07.970
studied overnight?

396
00:22:07.970 --> 00:22:11.509
To leave you behind, you did this to yourself.

397
00:22:11.509 --> 00:22:12.509
No.

398
00:22:12.509 --> 00:22:14.509
No, it was on you.

399
00:22:14.509 --> 00:22:15.579
You knew it.

400
00:22:15.579 --> 00:22:16.579
Bitch!

401
00:22:16.579 --> 00:22:17.579
Hey, hey.

402
00:22:17.579 --> 00:22:18.579
Ah!

403
00:22:18.579 --> 00:22:20.630
No!

404
00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:28.140
Don't waste your breath in here.

405
00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:47.180
Chef James?

406
00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:48.819
Yes.

407
00:22:48.819 --> 00:22:53.369
I would like a hot green tea with two lemons,

408
00:22:53.369 --> 00:22:55.720
2.3 grams of sugar,

409
00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:59.779
and the water should be about 120 degrees Fahrenheit.

410
00:23:00.779 --> 00:23:02.779
Seems like someone's looking for trouble.

411
00:23:02.779 --> 00:23:07.920
You got a problem with that?

412
00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:16.920
I do.

413
00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:18.920
I haven't finished my project for supposedly.

414
00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:30.619
That's my favorite job.

415
00:23:30.619 --> 00:23:31.619
I'll pay you back.

416
00:23:31.619 --> 00:23:36.940
With this.

417
00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:37.940
What's that?

418
00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:41.900
From that one, I'll take care of you and the baby.

419
00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:47.940
And you'll be my boss.

420
00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:48.940
Will you marry me?
