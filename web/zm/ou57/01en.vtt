00:00:26.379 --> 00:00:29.980
The car accident is caused tremendous blood loss in your grandson.

2
00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.579
He's AB negative blood, which is a very, very blood type.

3
00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:35.740
But the blood bank is running low.

4
00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.259
Well, then take the brought blood.

5
00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:41.039
The fraternal twins got the same blood type.

6
00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:44.320
But Ms. Clara's head injury is severe if we take more blood.

7
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.759
I don't care if she lives or dies. She's a demon.

8
00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:48.880
She's better off dead.

9
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.159
Drain her if you have to.

10
00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:54.479
Just save my grandson.

11
00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:57.259
You do that. And I'll see that you're promoted.

12
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.340
The boy is stable for now.

13
00:01:10.099 --> 00:01:12.739
But Ms. Clara has lost a lot of blood.

14
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:14.859
She may not make it.

15
00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:22.349
If she doesn't make it, dump her.

16
00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:35.950
She's cursed, and I don't want her death on to me.

17
00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.879
Mom, is your grandchild?

18
00:01:38.879 --> 00:01:40.400
How could you take her blood?

19
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.280
Shut up.

20
00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:43.739
She's cursed.

21
00:01:44.849 --> 00:01:48.209
My son drowned last year because of her.

22
00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:49.969
And now she almost killed Caleb.

23
00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:51.969
Mom, Simon died of swimming.

24
00:01:52.769 --> 00:01:54.849
And Caleb has heard in a car crash.

25
00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:55.890
Clara's a victim too.

26
00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:58.269
Can't blame.

27
00:01:58.269 --> 00:01:58.590
No.

28
00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.180
She is a demon.

29
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.599
Do you really want her around bringing more misery to this family?

30
00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:11.439
She should be grateful that her blood saved our Caleb.
