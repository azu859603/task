00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:17.050
Yeah, yeah. Oh, hey, yeah, yeah. No, let's get a beer after. How about that?

2
00:00:17.649 --> 00:00:39.570
This is the ring that your mother made for you and your siblings. If you survive, maybe you'll find its way back to her someday.

3
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:59.649
The child is this. Our face is cold as ice. Come on, little one. We gotta get you to hospital.

4
00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:16.450
You wrote that to me that window clean gate for the Walker group. It's been three months.

5
00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.450
Where's our money? I regret it gonna job the Walker group. Do you use the money to bribe them?

6
00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:26.450
Don't say that. This has nothing to do with my daughter. I've been trying to get your money.

7
00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:36.099
But you see this? Not only did the Walker group refuse to pay? Maybe the shit out of me. I'm still bleeding.

8
00:01:36.099 --> 00:01:41.099
I don't care. You brought us into this. You need to pay up. My dad needs our money for surgery.

9
00:01:41.099 --> 00:01:44.099
And my son needs it for tuition or he has to drop out of school.

10
00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:50.459
Give me three more days. If I don't get your money, I'll sell my blood to pay back.

11
00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:56.379
David, come quick. Brad's being attacked. Our gratitude. She's been attacked.

12
00:01:56.379 --> 00:02:00.379
You want to get your money from the Walker kid? Piss them right off. You gotta come help.
