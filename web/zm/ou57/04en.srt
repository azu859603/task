1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,109
How could you do this?

2
00:00:02,109 --> 00:00:05,370
Aren't you afraid that we're gonna report you to the Union?

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:07,980
The Union?

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,980
Have of them work for me. You think they're gonna side with you?

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,650
Mrs. Walker, please don't blame my daughter.

6
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:20,649
It's all because of me. She only got her into you into it with your son because of me.

7
00:00:20,649 --> 00:00:22,780
Please let her go.

8
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:25,940
I don't have time for you filthy bottom feeders.

9
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:27,940
So, are you gonna do it or not?

10
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:33,859
Security, hold her down and make her apologize to my son.

11
00:00:33,859 --> 00:00:43,630
Sorry, Mrs. Walker.

12
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:48,630
I don't blame her. I'll slap myself if that'll work.

13
00:00:48,630 --> 00:01:02,500
See this railing?

14
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,500
If you jump, I'll let you down to go.

15
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,750
Heck, I'll even throw in 10 grand.

16
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:11,750
Jump already is just two stories tells anyway.

17
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,750
Is that like you're gonna die?

18
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:15,750
No, Dad, please don't do it, okay?

19
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,750
Please, I'll let myself just don't let him jump.

20
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:22,819
If you don't jump, I'll fire a daughter.

21
00:01:22,819 --> 00:01:24,819
Press charges into a rotten prison.

22
00:01:24,819 --> 00:01:27,939
You don't want that.

23
00:01:27,939 --> 00:01:30,939
Fine. I'll do it.

24
00:01:30,939 --> 00:01:33,939
Dad, no, please don't do it. Don't jump.

25
00:01:33,939 --> 00:01:42,290
Walk along. Jump? What are you waiting for?

26
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:51,329
Mrs. Walker, if I do this jump, you promise to let her go?

27
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:52,780
Kill him.

28
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:53,780
See ya.
