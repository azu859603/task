1
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:07,200
Dad, are you okay?

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,199
It's awful.

3
00:00:08,199 --> 00:00:10,519
Still alive, huh?

4
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:12,519
Mr. Walker, I jumped.

5
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:15,519
Can you please let my daughter go now?

6
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,129
And my paycheck.

7
00:00:18,129 --> 00:00:20,609
Your paycheck?

8
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:22,640
You smashed my car.

9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,640
You owe me money.

10
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,640
It wasn't his fault.

11
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,640
You pushed him over the railing.

12
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,640
How could you be so cruel?

13
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,640
So what?

14
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,179
I don't get the ten grand.

15
00:00:32,179 --> 00:00:33,179
In three days, he's going to jail.

16
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:34,179
No, please.

17
00:00:34,179 --> 00:00:35,179
I'll work it off, okay?

18
00:00:35,179 --> 00:00:38,240
Please don't send him to train.

19
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,240
Get out of here before you journey up my company anymore.

20
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:44,100
Is that worse?

21
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,189
Yeah.

22
00:00:45,189 --> 00:00:54,130
You're...

23
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:55,320
Forget it.

24
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,320
Granny's gonna go to the hospital.

25
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,320
You're getting worse.

26
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,320
It's nothing.

27
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,320
It's just a fall.

28
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,320
But...

29
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,140
We don't give money to doctors.

30
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,140
I just want to go home.

31
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:08,140
There's something I have to give you.
