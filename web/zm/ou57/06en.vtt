00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:12.169
I don't have much time left.

2
00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:28.410
I need to tell credit.

3
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.750
You're all grown up now, and there's something you should know.

4
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.750
Fifteen years ago, I found you near a dumpster.

5
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.750
You were barely alive, bleeding out.

6
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.100
I took you to a hospital.

7
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.100
By some miracle, we share the same blood time.

8
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.460
Maybe negative.

9
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.000
I gave you my blood, and I saved you.

10
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Dad, I can't beat you.

11
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
I'm your daughter.

12
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
It's true.

13
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
You had a severe head injury.

14
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
You lost your memory.

15
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
And I never wanted to burn you with the past.

16
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.920
Inside this box is a ring with Clara.

17
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.920
Probably a keepsake from your real parents.

18
00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.159
This is a photo of you as a little girl.

19
00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.579
That's shortly after I found you.

20
00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:29.790
And I'm hoping that the ring and the photo help you reunite with your real parents.

21
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:37.019
Dad, my real family.

22
00:01:37.019 --> 00:01:40.019
I don't need anything else.

23
00:01:40.019 --> 00:01:43.019
Better. I think you should find them.

24
00:01:43.019 --> 00:01:46.019
Who knows if they had any choice to leave you?

25
00:01:46.019 --> 00:01:49.909
Someday you'll come to understand why.

26
00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.909
I've made you suffer over all these years.

27
00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.909
Just barely surviving.

28
00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:59.620
Fighting for every paycheck.

29
00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:12.360
I'm just hoping that finding your parents is going to give you promise me

30
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:22.330
will find them.

31
00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.710
I've never been to leave you, okay?

32
00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:30.219
You will always be my dad.
