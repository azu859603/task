1
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,080
Now that you're both adults, it's time to take on the family business.

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:13,080
Tomorrow we'll be celebrating the 20th anniversary of the company at the Los Angeles Hotel.

3
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:18,079
And I'll be announcing that each of you will be managing one of the two branches.

4
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:23,399
And in three years time, whoever performs best, will take my place.

5
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:25,399
I'll do my best to fall on your footsteps, Mom.

6
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:29,100
I'm so happy to have you all grown up.

7
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,100
Let's celebrate.

8
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,420
Let's have a toast.

9
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:36,140
Cheers, Clara.

10
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:40,630
Don't worry.

11
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:42,630
It's coffee, not alcohol.

12
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:47,210
We don't keep any booze in the house because we know you're allergic.

13
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:49,210
So it's like having you here with us.

14
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:54,329
Clara, how I help you with this for real?

15
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:56,679
You're the smartest.

16
00:00:56,679 --> 00:01:01,479
If you come back, you beat the perfect edge of the Walker group.

17
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:03,609
Where are you, sis?

18
00:01:03,609 --> 00:01:06,310
You saved my life back, Mom.

19
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:08,310
I'm straight in mind for you as if I could.
