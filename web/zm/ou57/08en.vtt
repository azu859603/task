00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:22.260
Dad, maybe we should leave.

2
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.059
Well, a person is a bully, do you really think he's going to give us some money?

3
00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:33.670
Mr. Walker asked us here, 10,000 means nothing to these people, it's just better an event

4
00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:45.039
like this, they'll pay up, don't worry.

5
00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:53.399
Well, well, well, look who it is, Greta, all dressed up, trying to snag a man in this

6
00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.429
party, aren't you?

7
00:00:56.429 --> 00:00:59.229
What's a janitor doing at a fancy event like this?

8
00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:03.350
Talk about bad luck, didn't they piss off Mr. Walker's son?

9
00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.099
How awkward that they showed up.

10
00:01:07.099 --> 00:01:15.849
I invited the janitor here, Mr. Walker, this is but a small token of mine.

11
00:01:15.849 --> 00:01:18.500
You really think I want your lousy cake?

12
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:28.680
We can't even afford that and you just, just, don't do this.

13
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.140
Mr. Walker, about that, 10,000.

14
00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.340
10,000.

15
00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.379
Sir, I'm here to tell you that you still owe me 100,000 for the car repairs.
