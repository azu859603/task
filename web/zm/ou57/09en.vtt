00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.980
You don't believe me? I, uh, on invoice here says, uh, 110,000 is the owing, but

2
00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.019
corresponds to salary of 10,000. You're on the hook for 100.

3
00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:22.910
You can't bully us like this. Mr. Walker, can you at least give me the 10,000 first?

4
00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:31.620
Now I accept the car repairs. I fell on the car. That's, that's a fact. But the workers need

5
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:40.079
their salary. I mean, some for education, some, some are getting surgery. Can you help out?

6
00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:50.780
I said like this. Such a noble cause. But how could a crippled trailer trash pay up 110 grand?

7
00:00:54.179 --> 00:01:02.429
I said I pay it. I sell my, my kidney. I sell my blood. I sell my spleen. I'll do whatever it takes.

8
00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:09.650
I'll work it off. That's so tragic. I don't think it has to be that way. Look, I'll have a chance.

9
00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.170
How about if you entertain me tonight and if I'm used to know, I'll give you a 10 grand.

10
00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:22.129
Dad, don't do what he is like. Relax. No jumping out windows this time. No damage. No injury.

11
00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:29.870
With all these witnesses here, do you really think I'll go back and win? What, what do you want me to do?

12
00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:36.879
We'll settle real. Crawl under me back and forth. And if you do it 10 times,

13
00:01:37.599 --> 00:01:42.560
I'll give you 10 grand. One grand each time. How dare you humiliate us like this?

14
00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:48.640
Well, what are you going to do about it? You do whatever I want. People like you are just toys for

15
00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:56.930
Mr. Walker to play with. Go on. Crawl. It's not like you have any dignity left. Consider it an honor.

16
00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:09.090
Money. I just need to get the money for my friends and leave something for Greta before I go. Fine. I'll do it.
