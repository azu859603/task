1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.160
Don't hurt my daughter!

2
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.160
Aww, daddy-daughter moment.

3
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.160
I said, touchy.

4
00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.140
Let's make this more memorable, shall we?

5
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:17.140
Please, just let us go. I'm begging you.

6
00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:18.500
Hey.

7
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.070
What are you from Monaco?

8
00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.070
You like money, right?

9
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.070
Let's see how you like the taste of a $10,000 bottle of vodka.

10
00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:36.859
That's a lot to eat.

11
00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:38.859
That's a punishment.

12
00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:40.859
That's a lot to eat.

13
00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:42.439
This'll kill her.

14
00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:45.020
That's your dangerous spot.

15
00:00:45.020 --> 00:01:02.859
He's there.

16
00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:04.299
I've had enough of you.

17
00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:05.299
You won't fart!

18
00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:10.930
To know how out of control the Walker family is?

19
00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:11.930
Have I taught you anything?

20
00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.930
Sis! I...

21
00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.620
Are you okay?

22
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.099
You need to go to the hospital?

23
00:01:21.099 --> 00:01:29.689
No, I'm fine. I just want to leave.

24
00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:35.459
Have we met?

25
00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:36.459
Put this on.

26
00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:38.459
It'll stop the itching in no time.

27
00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:41.840
You're the bestest. I want to stay with you forever.

28
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.840
Don't worry. I'll always care for you.

29
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.319
No one will hurt you.

30
00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:51.170
You must be thinking of someone else.

31
00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.170
I'm just a janitor's daughter and you're the Walker family heir.

32
00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.000
Of course we don't have anything to call him.

33
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.329
This is... this is enough for us.

34
00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:36.319
This card has $10,000 on it.

35
00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:39.319
Take it as a compensation for your medical expenses.

36
00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:45.469
The Walker's money isn't something just anyone can take.

37
00:02:45.469 --> 00:02:47.629
Do you even know where you are?

38
00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:49.629
Crashing a party is one thing.

39
00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:50.629
They're trying to extort money.

40
00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:52.629
Mom, it's not what you think.

41
00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:56.629
I came to settle with Caleb and he refused to pay and beat them instead.

42
00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:59.629
Trash like you deserve to be beaten for causing trouble here.

43
00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:03.099
Look at this mess.

44
00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:06.099
It's a miracle I'm not demanding compensation from you.

45
00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:08.099
And you're asking for money?

46
00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:09.300
Dream on.

47
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.300
You should go bring your father to the hospital.

48
00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.300
His injuries are getting worse and your rash is spreading.

49
00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.300
I'll handle things here.

50
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.300
Hurry up and get out.

51
00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.870
Filthy trailer trash funds coughing up blood and...

52
00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.870
This one's breaking out into a rash.

53
00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.870
I know some kind of diseases they're carrying.

54
00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.539
Disinfect every inch where these two walked.

55
00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:43.360
Stop! They're not going anywhere.

56
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.800
My ring is gone.

57
00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.990
Ring? What ring?

58
00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:51.250
Tony gave us, Mom.

59
00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.250
The last connection I have to my sister, I cannot lose it.

60
00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.039
I know she has it.

61
00:03:58.039 --> 00:04:00.039
Mr. Walker, please just let us go.

62
00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:03.039
My father is seriously injured and I need to get him to the hospital.

63
00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:06.039
Caleb, maybe you dropped it somewhere.

64
00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:08.039
Someone go search for Caleb's ring.

65
00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:09.039
Tony, search!

66
00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:11.039
That ring is on this bitch.

67
00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:13.039
No, I didn't steal your ring.

68
00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:14.039
Shut up!

69
00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:17.000
I knew you were trouble from the start.

70
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Who else but you could have taken the ring?

71
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
I swear I didn't.

72
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
I'm not lying.

73
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
I don't believe you. Hand it over.

74
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.639
Mrs. Walker, we may be poor, but we never steal.

75
00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:33.639
Greta would never do anything like that.

76
00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:35.639
Mom, they don't seem like thieves.

77
00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:36.639
Can we just keep looking?

78
00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:38.639
We'll find out soon enough.

79
00:04:39.959 --> 00:04:43.420
Search her.

80
00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:46.420
My daughter would never do anything like that.

81
00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.870
Mrs. Walker, please, I did not steal that ring.

82
00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.870
I really need to get my dad to the hospital.

83
00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:59.129
He's all I have left.

84
00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:00.129
Please don't hide my mom.

85
00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:03.129
Punish me instead. I'll take a place.

86
00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:05.670
We cannot let her go.

87
00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:06.670
We have to find this ring.

88
00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:08.670
It's the last connection I have with Claire.

89
00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:10.670
Greta's always been shady at work.

90
00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:13.149
I'm pretty sure she did the ring.

91
00:05:13.149 --> 00:05:15.149
That ring is important to us.

92
00:05:15.149 --> 00:05:17.180
I'm giving you one last chance.

93
00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.180
Hand it over and I'll let you go.

94
00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.180
Oh, I didn't steal the ring.

95
00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.180
Ungrateful bitch.

96
00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:26.180
Strip her and search every inch.

97
00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.819
I'll do it.

98
00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:35.370
What do you think?

99
00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:38.199
Take my life if you have to.

100
00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:39.199
It'll trap.

101
00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:42.199
Dress like this to seduce men in the party?

102
00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:44.199
Well, I'll give you what you want.

103
00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:57.009
I promise everything.

104
00:05:57.009 --> 00:05:58.459
Mrs. Walker.

105
00:05:58.459 --> 00:05:59.459
Mrs. Walker.

106
00:05:59.459 --> 00:06:00.490
Mrs. Walker.

107
00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:01.490
Nothing.

108
00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:07.649
Mrs. Walker, can we go now?

109
00:06:07.649 --> 00:06:09.870
This time you got lucky.

110
00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:12.670
But get out.

111
00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:14.769
Now remember your place.

112
00:06:14.769 --> 00:06:16.769
Stay away from the Walker family.

113
00:06:16.769 --> 00:06:18.769
Don't worry. You won't see us again.

114
00:06:18.769 --> 00:06:22.860
Who knows what diseases us trailer trash have.

115
00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:25.860
We don't want to harm your precious health.

116
00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:46.709
Mom, today's mess was really Caleb's fault.

117
00:06:46.709 --> 00:06:48.709
Don't you think we went a little too far?

118
00:06:48.709 --> 00:06:52.060
And that girl. Greta.

119
00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:54.180
Her and her father are heartbreaking.

120
00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:56.180
Especially Greta.

121
00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.180
She kind of reminds me of her.

122
00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:01.180
Caleb's ring is his connection to Clara.

123
00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:05.019
It's a symbol of your unity as siblings.

124
00:07:05.019 --> 00:07:07.819
It's too important to lose.

125
00:07:07.819 --> 00:07:09.819
So what if we were a bit harsh?

126
00:07:09.819 --> 00:07:10.819
Greta didn't steal the ring.

127
00:07:10.819 --> 00:07:12.819
So must still be here in the halls.

128
00:07:12.819 --> 00:07:21.339
Just keep looking.

129
00:07:21.339 --> 00:07:22.339
Wait.

130
00:07:22.339 --> 00:07:28.199
Is that?

131
00:07:28.199 --> 00:07:29.199
Yes.

132
00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:30.199
Yes it's mine.

133
00:07:30.199 --> 00:07:32.230
It's the last connection I had with her.

134
00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:46.579
I wouldn't have died if you didn't find it.

135
00:07:46.579 --> 00:07:48.709
This is Clara's ring.

136
00:07:48.709 --> 00:07:49.709
It's really her ring.

137
00:07:49.709 --> 00:07:50.709
She's alive.

138
00:07:50.709 --> 00:07:52.709
She came back to find me.

139
00:07:52.709 --> 00:07:56.639
You were so close to me and I didn't realize.

140
00:07:56.639 --> 00:07:59.699
It's my fault.

141
00:07:59.699 --> 00:08:02.300
I'm so sorry.

142
00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:05.720
This ring must belong to one of the guests tonight.

143
00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:06.720
Check the list.

144
00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:08.720
Sort out everyone whose age matches with Clara's.

145
00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:09.720
I'll get on it right away.

146
00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:11.720
And keep an eye on the banquet hall.

147
00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:13.720
If Clara lost her ring, she might come back for it.

148
00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:18.730
And we all need to be here when she does.

149
00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:19.730
We'll find her.

150
00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:24.000
Clara will come back to us.

151
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.420
Caleb.

152
00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:27.420
You touched that janitor's dirty blood.

153
00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:29.670
Go to the hospital and get checked out.

154
00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:32.669
Who knows what kind of diseases you may have caught.

155
00:08:32.669 --> 00:08:40.009
Doctor, please.

156
00:08:40.009 --> 00:08:42.009
You have to save my death.

157
00:08:42.009 --> 00:08:44.009
His kidneys are failing.

158
00:08:44.009 --> 00:08:48.009
I can try to ease his pain and waive some of the test fees.

159
00:08:48.009 --> 00:08:51.009
But you'll need to raise half a million dollars for a transplant.

160
00:08:51.009 --> 00:08:55.139
Without it, he won't make it past three months.

161
00:08:55.139 --> 00:08:57.059
Hey, buddy.

162
00:08:57.059 --> 00:08:58.059
Did you find me that cornea?

163
00:08:58.059 --> 00:08:59.059
Just a reminder.

164
00:08:59.059 --> 00:09:02.059
As you lost the bet, you got to find me that cornea.

165
00:09:02.059 --> 00:09:03.059
If you don't,

166
00:09:03.059 --> 00:09:08.059
well, everyone in LA is going to know tomorrow that Mr. Walker is dishonest and unreliable.

167
00:09:08.059 --> 00:09:09.059
Yeah.

168
00:09:09.059 --> 00:09:10.059
I'm still working on it.

169
00:09:10.059 --> 00:09:11.059
Good, good.

170
00:09:11.059 --> 00:09:12.059
Walker, you're the man in LA.

171
00:09:12.059 --> 00:09:14.059
If anyone can pull it off, it's you.

172
00:09:14.059 --> 00:09:16.059
Looking forward to seeing my cornea by the end of the day.

173
00:09:16.059 --> 00:09:18.059
Rest assured, I've got to cover it.

174
00:09:18.059 --> 00:09:19.059
Don't you worry.

175
00:09:19.059 --> 00:09:21.059
You'll have the cornea soon enough.

176
00:09:21.059 --> 00:09:24.570
Can we just use my kidneys?

177
00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:26.570
I mean, I'll give both to save him.

178
00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:31.570
Even if we could use yours, you'd still have the cost of surgery and recovery.

179
00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:35.570
Besides, we're not even sure if they're compatible.

180
00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:38.950
You really need to find that half a million.

181
00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:53.909
Sorry I failed you.

182
00:09:53.909 --> 00:09:58.019
It's all moveful.

183
00:09:58.019 --> 00:09:59.019
Give it a stay.

184
00:09:59.019 --> 00:10:00.210
She's in it.

185
00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:10.179
She'll be begging to donate her cornea.

186
00:10:10.179 --> 00:10:11.179
Janitor lives.

187
00:10:11.179 --> 00:10:17.230
Mr. Walker, my father's kidneys are failing.

188
00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:19.230
And he does not have much time left.

189
00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:21.230
Please, I'm begging you.

190
00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:25.149
Just hold that to you guys.

191
00:10:25.149 --> 00:10:26.279
Relax.

192
00:10:26.279 --> 00:10:29.139
I'm just here to make you an offer.

193
00:10:29.139 --> 00:10:32.139
My friend recently got in a car accident and lost his eye.

194
00:10:32.139 --> 00:10:34.529
He needs a cornea.

195
00:10:34.529 --> 00:10:38.529
If you were willing to donate yours, it would give you half a million dollars.

196
00:10:38.529 --> 00:10:39.529
What do you say?

197
00:10:39.529 --> 00:10:42.230
Are you serious?

198
00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:43.230
Yes.

199
00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:45.230
He's not a contract if he really wants to.

200
00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:48.740
But this is the only way to save your dad.

201
00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:51.740
Otherwise, you have to let him die.

202
00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:56.299
I'll do it.

203
00:10:56.299 --> 00:10:58.549
No.

204
00:10:58.549 --> 00:11:00.549
Absolutely not.

205
00:11:00.549 --> 00:11:03.789
Dad, you're awake.

206
00:11:03.789 --> 00:11:04.789
Thank goodness.

207
00:11:04.789 --> 00:11:08.460
Mr. Walker, please leave.

208
00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:15.590
Even if I die, Greta, give up her cornea.

209
00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:17.779
You old farts.

210
00:11:17.779 --> 00:11:21.100
Greta should be honored to give her cornea.

211
00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:26.960
If you come begging to me later, this offer will not stand.

212
00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:27.960
You better choose soon.

213
00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:32.220
It's okay.

214
00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:33.220
It's just a cornea.

215
00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:35.220
I'll still have another eye.

216
00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:36.700
Listen to me.

217
00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:38.700
Listen a little bit.

218
00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:47.340
I just want you to be safe and healthy.

219
00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:48.399
Yeah.

220
00:11:48.399 --> 00:11:53.399
If you go rest, hurting yourself and giving up your cornea, I swear to God.

221
00:11:53.399 --> 00:11:56.559
Jump off the roof of this hospital.

222
00:11:56.559 --> 00:11:57.559
It's okay.

223
00:11:57.559 --> 00:11:58.750
I promise.

224
00:11:58.750 --> 00:11:59.750
I promise.

225
00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:01.750
Just don't get upset.

226
00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:14.379
Greta's janitor father's kidneys failed.

227
00:12:14.379 --> 00:12:18.480
I mean, transplant alone will cost half a million.

228
00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:19.480
You know what?

229
00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:25.740
At this point, I say just let him die.

230
00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:27.740
Can't raise the money, huh?

231
00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:29.740
Go down and lick my heels.

232
00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:33.740
And I'll give you a hundred bucks.

233
00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:46.480
Greta, have you thought about what I said yesterday?

234
00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:50.480
Look, I promise my dad I'm not donating my cornea to your friend.

235
00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:51.740
Fine.

236
00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:54.990
But if you're going to be stubborn, you're demoted.

237
00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:57.990
Replacing your dad's janitor and your salad's cut to 1500.

238
00:12:57.990 --> 00:13:01.299
You're just bullying me.

239
00:13:01.299 --> 00:13:02.299
Why are you doing this?

240
00:13:02.299 --> 00:13:04.299
Why are you punishing me?

241
00:13:04.299 --> 00:13:05.299
My family runs this company.

242
00:13:05.299 --> 00:13:07.299
I make the rules here.

243
00:13:07.299 --> 00:13:10.370
If you think I'm being too hard on you, you can quit.

244
00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:14.980
But if you quit, you have no one come at all.

245
00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:22.379
And your dad will have to wait around and die.

246
00:13:22.379 --> 00:13:23.379
Fine.

247
00:13:23.379 --> 00:13:25.120
I'll do it.

248
00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:37.190
I'll be the janitor.

249
00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:38.190
Good.

250
00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:40.340
Back here.

251
00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:41.340
You missed the spot.

252
00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:45.840
We're going too far.

253
00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:52.809
So what if I do, huh?

254
00:13:52.809 --> 00:13:57.309
Your father's a janitor.

255
00:13:57.309 --> 00:13:59.950
And now you are too.

256
00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:03.950
Either trash and you clean up after me.

257
00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:06.230
What?

258
00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:09.059
You don't like it?

259
00:14:09.059 --> 00:14:10.059
Then quit.

260
00:14:10.059 --> 00:14:18.379
But remember, if you quit, your father won't have enough money for his medical bills.

261
00:14:18.379 --> 00:14:26.590
That's more like it.

262
00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:29.590
A janitor should know her place.

263
00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:35.750
Since why are you taking so long?

264
00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:37.750
Just use them more.

265
00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:39.750
This way there won't be any coffee stains.

266
00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:42.750
I want the food to be spotless, or as Dad would get mad at you again.

267
00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:51.240
Mr. Walker, Greta's just a filthy janitor.

268
00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:54.169
Get away from her.

269
00:14:54.169 --> 00:14:56.169
It's just a coincidence.

270
00:14:56.169 --> 00:15:27.299
There's no way that filthy trash could remind me of my sister.

271
00:15:27.299 --> 00:15:29.299
Who gave you permission to enter my office?

272
00:15:29.299 --> 00:15:34.639
Mr. Walker, I was just here to clean your office.

273
00:15:34.639 --> 00:15:37.639
Do you think someone like you deserves to clean my office?

274
00:15:37.639 --> 00:15:40.639
You people are nothing but filth.

275
00:15:40.639 --> 00:15:42.639
You injured my son.

276
00:15:42.639 --> 00:15:44.639
You ruined the company banquet.

277
00:15:44.639 --> 00:15:46.639
And your father's filthy blood got all over him.

278
00:15:46.639 --> 00:15:49.639
You're lucky that he didn't get infected.

279
00:15:49.639 --> 00:15:51.639
Because I would have made you people pay.

280
00:15:51.639 --> 00:15:52.639
Now get out.

281
00:15:52.639 --> 00:15:53.639
Leave Walker Group.

282
00:15:53.639 --> 00:15:54.639
You're not welcome here.

283
00:15:54.639 --> 00:15:57.639
Wait, Mrs. Walker, I really need this job.

284
00:15:57.639 --> 00:16:01.639
My father's kidneys are failing, and I'm the only one earning money.

285
00:16:01.639 --> 00:16:03.639
I really need this job.

286
00:16:03.639 --> 00:16:05.639
Your father's kidney failure is not my problem.

287
00:16:05.639 --> 00:16:07.639
Please, Mrs. Walker, I'll do anything.

288
00:16:07.639 --> 00:16:10.639
Don't touch me. Get out now.

289
00:16:10.639 --> 00:16:16.980
You have no idea how filthy you are, do you?

290
00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:20.330
Mom, I'm going to assign Greta to do the cleaning.

291
00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:23.330
And you chose this one to clean my office.

292
00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:26.330
Look at her wrinkled clothes and her torn shoes.

293
00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:29.330
She's trash. How can she do a proper job?

294
00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:31.330
If we did that, we'd have to hire another janitor.

295
00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:35.330
Besides, Greta's already here, and she's doing her job.

296
00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:38.639
It just saves the company money.

297
00:16:38.639 --> 00:16:41.639
Until I get Greta's corn, yeah, I can't let Mom fire her.

298
00:16:41.639 --> 00:16:43.639
Her Jackson will be a big mouth.

299
00:16:43.639 --> 00:16:47.179
Fine. Do whatever you want.

300
00:16:47.179 --> 00:16:50.179
But when you clean my office, wear shoe covers.

301
00:16:50.179 --> 00:16:52.179
And don't even think about stealing anything.

302
00:16:52.179 --> 00:16:55.179
If I catch you, you'll regret it.

303
00:16:55.179 --> 00:16:56.179
Now get out.

304
00:16:56.179 --> 00:17:04.420
Any news about your sister?

305
00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:06.420
I've got all my resources checking the guest list.

306
00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:09.420
I've also installed cameras in every corner of the banquet hall.

307
00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:11.420
If Claire comes back, we'll know immediately.

308
00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:19.950
It's all my fault.

309
00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:21.660
Where are you?

310
00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:25.299
I didn't realize how close you were.

311
00:17:25.299 --> 00:17:29.839
Next time, if you come back, I'll never let you go again.

312
00:17:29.839 --> 00:17:40.059
Can we talk?

313
00:17:40.059 --> 00:17:47.940
My mother was awful to you the other day.

314
00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:49.940
I'm here to apologize on her behalf.

315
00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:52.839
This card has $10,000 on it.

316
00:17:52.839 --> 00:17:55.839
I've considered a compensation of the Walker family.

317
00:17:55.839 --> 00:17:57.829
I can't accept that.

318
00:17:57.829 --> 00:17:59.829
I know about your father's medical condition.

319
00:17:59.829 --> 00:18:01.900
But consider it alone.

320
00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:03.900
I can pay me back whenever you can.

321
00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:04.900
How does that sound?

322
00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:07.049
Okay.

323
00:18:07.049 --> 00:18:10.640
Thank you.

324
00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:11.640
Now let's see.

325
00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:21.329
Why are you eating just the crust?

326
00:18:21.329 --> 00:18:22.329
I like the crust.

327
00:18:22.329 --> 00:18:23.329
It's chewy.

328
00:18:23.329 --> 00:18:26.329
I'll take the soft part for my dad.

329
00:18:26.329 --> 00:18:28.619
So you have a soft part?

330
00:18:28.619 --> 00:18:29.710
Why aren't you eating it?

331
00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:30.710
I like the crust.

332
00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:31.710
It's chewy.

333
00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:32.710
All right.

334
00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:34.710
Miss Walker, I think it's getting kind of late.

335
00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:37.710
I should probably get back to take care of my dad.

336
00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:38.710
Of course.

337
00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:40.380
Do you need a red?

338
00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:41.380
No, that's okay.

339
00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:42.380
You've already done more than enough for me.

340
00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:44.380
And I promise I will pay you back.

341
00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:46.339
Okay.

342
00:18:46.339 --> 00:18:47.339
Can I take this?

343
00:18:47.339 --> 00:18:55.099
If my sister hadn't been abandoned.

344
00:18:55.099 --> 00:18:57.099
She'd be about this age now.

345
00:18:57.099 --> 00:18:59.539
Could it be?

346
00:18:59.539 --> 00:19:00.539
No.

347
00:19:00.539 --> 00:19:06.130
I'm done with this.

348
00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:07.130
You're going home.

349
00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:10.130
I don't want to be a burden on you anymore.

350
00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:12.579
Time to be okay.

351
00:19:12.579 --> 00:19:15.579
Walker's feeling really bad about what happened at the banquet.

352
00:19:15.579 --> 00:19:17.579
This is Walker even promoted me.

353
00:19:17.579 --> 00:19:19.579
After hearing about our situation.

354
00:19:19.579 --> 00:19:20.579
Really?

355
00:19:20.579 --> 00:19:22.579
You're not lying to me?

356
00:19:22.579 --> 00:19:24.579
No, of course not.

357
00:19:24.579 --> 00:19:25.700
It's the truth.

358
00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:30.950
Look, she even gave me a $10,000 advancement.

359
00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:32.210
Good.

360
00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:34.210
Maybe this is Walker.

361
00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:39.339
It's just strict on the outside, but she's a good person at heart.

362
00:19:39.339 --> 00:19:40.339
Yeah.

363
00:19:40.339 --> 00:19:43.940
She's not so bad.

364
00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:50.549
Really, it's time to take the fruit platter to miss Walker's office.

365
00:19:50.549 --> 00:19:52.549
I'm busy, I'm busy, I'm busy.

366
00:19:52.549 --> 00:19:58.240
Greta, take the fruit platter to Mrs. Walker's office.

367
00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:01.460
Do you remember where she likes apples?

368
00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:02.559
Oh.

369
00:20:02.559 --> 00:20:14.950
Okay.

370
00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:16.950
Mrs. Walker, here's your fruit platter.

371
00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:19.559
Who told you to come in here?

372
00:20:19.559 --> 00:20:21.559
I lose my appetite just knowing you've touched it.

373
00:20:21.559 --> 00:20:28.059
Let's be tight for more.

374
00:20:28.059 --> 00:20:30.059
I cut these apples for you.

375
00:20:30.059 --> 00:20:39.640
Like this.

376
00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:43.849
Who taught you to do this?

377
00:20:43.849 --> 00:20:44.849
Mom, what's going on?

378
00:20:44.849 --> 00:20:48.069
Mom, did this little tramp mess up again?

379
00:20:48.069 --> 00:20:50.069
I'll take care of her for you.

380
00:20:50.069 --> 00:20:51.970
No, no, it's fine.

381
00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:52.970
You can go now.

382
00:20:52.970 --> 00:21:00.349
Haven't you noticed how much Greta resembles Clara?

383
00:21:00.349 --> 00:21:02.349
She's just saying that because it was Clara so much.

384
00:21:02.349 --> 00:21:04.349
She's just that dirty, janitor's daughter.

385
00:21:04.349 --> 00:21:06.349
There's no way she could be Clara.

386
00:21:06.349 --> 00:21:08.349
Yeah, but what if she's not really David's daughter?

387
00:21:08.349 --> 00:21:09.349
What are you talking about?

388
00:21:09.349 --> 00:21:10.349
They're exactly alike.

389
00:21:10.349 --> 00:21:13.349
If she really was Clara, don't you think I'd recognize her?

390
00:21:13.349 --> 00:21:15.349
Or Mom would recognize her for that matter?

391
00:21:15.349 --> 00:21:19.609
From now on, Greta will bring me my fruit platter every day.

392
00:21:19.609 --> 00:21:21.609
And give her a $3,000 race.

393
00:21:21.609 --> 00:21:23.609
Mom, that's a bit short.

394
00:21:23.609 --> 00:21:26.609
Charlotte, I need your help looking into Greta's background.

395
00:21:26.609 --> 00:21:28.670
Don't miss a single clue.

396
00:21:28.670 --> 00:21:39.990
Your father's condition has worsened.

397
00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:43.119
We'll need to settle that surgery bill within three days.

398
00:21:43.119 --> 00:21:45.119
Dr. Orr, can't we just use my...

399
00:21:45.119 --> 00:21:47.119
We've already tested your kidneys.

400
00:21:47.119 --> 00:21:49.119
They're not compatible with your father's.

401
00:21:49.119 --> 00:21:54.119
As far as the payment goes, half a million dollars was the lowest I could negotiate.

402
00:21:54.119 --> 00:22:00.119
Listen, I understand it's almost impossible for a regular family to rake in that much money.

403
00:22:00.119 --> 00:22:02.119
Maybe it's better to let it go.

404
00:22:02.119 --> 00:22:13.859
I'm making it half a million dollars.

405
00:22:13.859 --> 00:22:15.859
Everything I have is worthless.

406
00:22:15.859 --> 00:22:19.740
Except the ring, I still have the ring on me.

407
00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:22.190
It must be worth something.

408
00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:30.220
I can use it to pay for my father's treatment.

409
00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:32.220
I must have dropped it at the banquet.

410
00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:35.690
After her find it.

411
00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:58.160
Where are you?

412
00:22:58.160 --> 00:22:59.349
Mrs. Walker.

413
00:22:59.349 --> 00:23:01.349
Someone's at the banquet hall right now.

414
00:23:01.349 --> 00:23:03.890
Really?

415
00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:05.890
Someone's actually at the banquet hall?

416
00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:06.890
Who is it?

417
00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:07.890
I've already connected the surveillance feed.

418
00:23:07.890 --> 00:23:13.430
Take a look.

419
00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:14.430
It's her?

420
00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:20.119
Mrs. Walker, please, I did not steal that ring.

421
00:23:20.119 --> 00:23:24.119
I really need to get my dad to the hospital. He's all I have left.

422
00:23:24.119 --> 00:23:25.119
It's her.

423
00:23:25.119 --> 00:23:31.829
I should have realized sooner.

424
00:23:31.829 --> 00:23:32.829
Quick.

425
00:23:32.829 --> 00:23:33.829
Get the car.

426
00:23:33.829 --> 00:23:35.930
We're going to the banquet hall.

427
00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:36.930
I need to meet my daughter.

428
00:23:36.930 --> 00:23:45.839
Did you lose something?

429
00:23:45.839 --> 00:23:51.819
Uh, yeah, Mrs. Walker, I just lost something.

430
00:23:51.819 --> 00:23:53.819
I'm so sorry to disturb you.

431
00:23:53.819 --> 00:24:00.049
What exactly did you lose?

432
00:24:00.049 --> 00:24:01.049
Lost my...

433
00:24:01.049 --> 00:24:02.240
Greta!

434
00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:04.940
I said you took my hairpin.

435
00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:06.940
I was wondering where I went.

436
00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:12.589
I finally caught you.

437
00:24:12.589 --> 00:24:15.589
Now, what do you have to say for yourself?

438
00:24:15.589 --> 00:24:19.589
I just found it in the banquet hall. I didn't steal it.

439
00:24:19.589 --> 00:24:23.589
This diamond hairpin is very valuable.

440
00:24:23.589 --> 00:24:26.589
You must have lost it during the company's banquet.

441
00:24:26.589 --> 00:24:30.589
And you must have picked it up and decided to keep it.

442
00:24:30.589 --> 00:24:33.589
If it hadn't come back for it, you would have stolen it.

443
00:24:33.589 --> 00:24:34.589
You're so into me arm.

444
00:24:34.589 --> 00:24:36.589
So it was just false hope.

445
00:24:36.589 --> 00:24:39.009
She was here to steal.

446
00:24:39.009 --> 00:24:41.900
Get after my sight.

447
00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:44.900
You're not allowed to enter the company without permission anymore.

448
00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:46.900
Or I'll have your legs broken.

449
00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:49.900
No, no, I was really looking for something. I'm not lying.

450
00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:53.250
No, I really was looking for something.

451
00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:54.250
I'm not...

452
00:24:54.250 --> 00:24:55.250
Stay where you are.

453
00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:56.250
Don't come near me, trash.

454
00:24:56.250 --> 00:24:59.250
All right, but Mrs. Walker, please just hear me out.

455
00:24:59.250 --> 00:25:01.250
I don't want to hear it.

456
00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:02.250
Security!

457
00:25:02.250 --> 00:25:04.250
It's low life out of here.

458
00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:15.759
Dr. Aurora, how's my dad doing?

459
00:25:15.759 --> 00:25:18.759
His condition is critical. We need to operate immediately.

460
00:25:18.759 --> 00:25:20.759
Greta, you have two options.

461
00:25:20.759 --> 00:25:23.759
Find the money for the surgery in the next two days.

462
00:25:23.759 --> 00:25:26.759
Or let them go in peace.

463
00:25:26.759 --> 00:25:28.859
What's your decision?

464
00:25:29.859 --> 00:25:32.859
I can't do that, Dr. Aurora, please.

465
00:25:32.859 --> 00:25:34.859
Save him. I'll do anything.

466
00:25:34.859 --> 00:25:36.859
I've done everything I can.

467
00:25:36.859 --> 00:25:39.859
Maybe ask your friends or family if they can lend you the money?

468
00:25:39.859 --> 00:25:49.539
Who would be willing to give me that much money?

469
00:25:49.539 --> 00:26:06.329
I'm just here to make you an offer.

470
00:26:06.329 --> 00:26:09.549
My friend recently got in a car accident and lost his eye.

471
00:26:09.549 --> 00:26:11.940
He needs a cornea.

472
00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:17.130
If you were willing to donate yours, it would give you half a million dollars.

473
00:26:17.130 --> 00:26:18.130
What do you say?

474
00:26:18.130 --> 00:26:26.880
Who's calling me at this hour?

475
00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:30.220
Mr. Walker? It's me.
