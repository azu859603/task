1
00:00:01,169 --> 00:00:05,169
So, Jackson, what do you think about her?

2
00:00:05,169 --> 00:00:07,169
Her cornea is good enough?

3
00:00:07,169 --> 00:00:09,419
He's bright, beautiful eyes.

4
00:00:09,419 --> 00:00:11,419
I'm very pleased.

5
00:00:11,419 --> 00:00:15,570
You never disappoint Walker.

6
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,629
Look, I agreed to donate my cornea,

7
00:00:18,629 --> 00:00:20,629
but when am I getting the half million dollars?

8
00:00:20,629 --> 00:00:22,629
Greta, don't worry.

9
00:00:22,629 --> 00:00:25,109
We've already signed the contract.

10
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:27,109
As soon as the cornea is out,

11
00:00:27,109 --> 00:00:30,429
the money will be in your account, all right?

12
00:00:30,429 --> 00:00:32,429
Greta, everything's ready.

13
00:00:32,429 --> 00:00:34,429
We can proceed with the surgery now.

14
00:00:34,429 --> 00:00:44,460
Here, you can make the transfer.

15
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,460
Half a million is a pretty good transfer.

16
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:48,780
Come on, Caleb.

17
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,780
You don't really expect me to pay her, dude.

18
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:51,780
What do you mean?

19
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:52,780
She's just a poor nobody.

20
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:54,780
And the fact that I'm willing to take your cornea

21
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,780
is a privilege to her.

22
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:58,780
Expecting pain was a joke.

23
00:00:58,780 --> 00:00:59,780
Look, man, I did it.

24
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:00,780
Come on, Caleb.

25
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,780
You know the parties we can throw

26
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:04,780
with half a million dollars.

27
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:06,780
I wasted on a worthless nobody.

28
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,780
Just leave it to me, okay?

29
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:10,780
She's not going to be expecting a dime from us.

30
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,780
Trust me on that.

31
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,519
As bastards,

32
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:19,519
I have to stop Greta before it's too late.

33
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:30,329
Keep his eavesdrop on us and get away with it, old man.

34
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:32,329
I should kill you for this.
