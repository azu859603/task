00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.719
Don't do that, it's my dad calling me.

2
00:00:04.719 --> 00:00:05.719
Dad?

3
00:00:05.719 --> 00:00:07.330
Dad?

4
00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:08.400
Dad?

5
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.589
Dad?

6
00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:13.519
Dad, what am I doing to you?

7
00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:15.019
Why are you doing this?

8
00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:17.739
Greta, what are you doing here?

9
00:00:17.739 --> 00:00:19.640
Do you want the half million dollars?

10
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.440
Don't you want to save your dying father?

11
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:23.440
Don't let him die.

12
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.570
I've heard him.

13
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.969
You're trying to trick you into taking your coordinates for nothing.

14
00:00:27.969 --> 00:00:31.199
Why would you lie to me?

15
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.600
We have already suffered so much.

16
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.600
What more do you want?

17
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.399
Get back in there and finish the surgery.

18
00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:40.799
I'll stomp you back to death.

19
00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:45.200
And what we may be broke but we are still human and we have feelings.

20
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.200
Do you even have a conscience?

21
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.229
How could you be so cruel?

22
00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:50.729
Go back in there.

23
00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:54.229
Don't hit your cornea and I'll arrange your father's surgery immediately.

24
00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:55.229
How's that?

25
00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:58.189
Don't leave him.

26
00:00:58.189 --> 00:01:01.670
I won't donate my cornea.

27
00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.670
I will never trust you again.
