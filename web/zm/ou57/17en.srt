1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,719
Did you find Clara?

2
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:07,719
False alarm.

3
00:00:07,719 --> 00:00:08,720
What happened?

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,279
It was this stupid Greta, always causing trouble.

5
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:13,720
Hayley lost her diamond hairpin at the banquet.

6
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,359
And Greta, desperate for money,

7
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:18,960
thought it was valuable and tried to keep it for herself.

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,760
Greta doesn't seem like the type of person to do so.

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,359
We've given Greta too many chances.

10
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:27,519
Tomorrow we'll settle her wages and fire her.

11
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,199
By the way, where's Caleb?

12
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,199
He left a little while ago.

13
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:38,579
Caleb's been in a car accident.

14
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,539
Your father's condition was bad enough.

15
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:47,219
Now with this injury.

16
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:51,649
I'm not sure he'll make it to the end of the month.

17
00:00:51,649 --> 00:00:53,890
Dr. Ora has been an accident.

18
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:56,250
Caleb Walker was in a car crash.

19
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,210
He's lost a lot of blood and he needs to transfusion immediately.

20
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:00,810
His blood type is AB negative,

21
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,609
but we don't have any in stock anymore

22
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:04,489
and we don't have time to fix this.

23
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:05,730
AB negative?

24
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:07,650
If something happens to him,

25
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,930
Mrs. Walker will have our heads.

26
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:12,010
Dr. Ora, what shall we do?

27
00:01:12,049 --> 00:01:15,209
Greta, come with me to save Mr. Walker.

28
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:17,810
This could be a way to pay for your father's treatment.
