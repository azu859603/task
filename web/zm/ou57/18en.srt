1
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:19,170
Doctor, how was my son?

2
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:22,170
Mrs. Walker, Caleb has lost a lot of blood.

3
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,170
It's helping, but it's not enough.

4
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:26,170
And she's already given more than she should.

5
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:27,170
If we take any more...

6
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:28,170
Take it!

7
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:30,170
My son's life is worth more than hers.

8
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:33,329
If I have to, I'll pay her off later.

9
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:35,329
Mom, that's just way too risky.

10
00:00:35,329 --> 00:00:37,329
Greta might not survive.

11
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:40,329
And you remember how grandma ordered Clara's blood to be drained.

12
00:00:40,329 --> 00:00:41,329
Don't make the same mistake.

13
00:00:41,329 --> 00:00:42,329
Shut up!

14
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:44,329
She's just a janitor's daughter.

15
00:00:44,329 --> 00:00:46,840
Her life is not worth more than Clara's.

16
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,060
If her blood can save Caleb, it is her honor.

17
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,829
And we'll just pay off David later.

18
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:54,960
What are you waiting for?

19
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,960
If anything happens to my son, you will pay.

20
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:57,960
Draw the blood.

21
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,960
Mom, you can't do this.

22
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,960
Draw it!

23
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,960
Mrs. Walker, I cannot do that.

24
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,960
If you can't do it, just leave.

25
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,959
I'll take care of it.

26
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:06,959
Thank you, Dr. Scott.

27
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:11,890
Dr. Scott, this will put Greta's life in serious danger.

28
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:15,209
Mr. Walker's life is more important.

29
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:18,620
Do it. Get out.
