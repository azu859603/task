00:00:01.169 --> 00:00:06.910
What? Where am I? Where are you taking me?

2
00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:08.910
Taking you for surgery right away.

3
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.109
I don't have any money.

4
00:00:10.109 --> 00:00:13.679
Oh, don't worry about it. Your daughter's life paper already.

5
00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.879
Where is my daughter? It's to walk ahead and accident.

6
00:00:16.879 --> 00:00:20.879
He needed Greta's blood. She donated to save him.

7
00:00:20.879 --> 00:00:23.359
Therefore, the hospital is covering your treatment.

8
00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:25.280
I don't know, Greta.

9
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.280
Please, if you have to stay still, you have to stay still.

10
00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.120
No, sir. No, sir. Stop.

11
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.480
I need my daughter.

12
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.079
No, no. Sir, stop.

13
00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:48.939
Get out of my way. Sir, no.

14
00:00:48.939 --> 00:00:56.189
This is Walker. Kayla's life has been saved, but Greta's not going to make it.

15
00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:59.869
I'll throw her out then. I don't want her bacteria infecting my son.
