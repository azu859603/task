1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:09,779
You don't have any left. There's nothing more we can do.

2
00:00:09,779 --> 00:00:17,079
No, take mine. I know. I can do it. Take all of my blood if that will do it.

3
00:00:17,079 --> 00:00:22,699
Your daughter has AB negative luck. Not just anyone can donate to her.

4
00:00:22,699 --> 00:00:25,100
Look, I have a badge.

5
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,539
I understand how much you want to save her.

6
00:00:28,539 --> 00:00:31,539
But AB negative is incredibly rare.

7
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:34,539
When she was young, her child was just a child, she almost bled out.

8
00:00:34,539 --> 00:00:39,670
I saved her with my blood. I can't. I may be negative.

9
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:45,789
I can save her. I'll take full responsibility if anything was wrong.

10
00:00:45,789 --> 00:00:52,250
Follow me. There might still be time.

11
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:57,420
Could it be? Is Greta really?

12
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:04,069
He's awake. My brother's alive.

13
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:11,269
You've been terribly injured. You need to just rest and stay put for few days.

14
00:01:11,269 --> 00:01:19,319
You have to be more careful from now on. AB negative blood is rare if he hadn't been so lucky this time.

15
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:23,989
Who saved me? Who gave me blood?

16
00:01:23,989 --> 00:01:41,760
You just need to rest. Dr. Scott, how's Greta doing?

17
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:46,760
Her life has been saved. But she'll still need to be closely monitored.

18
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,760
It's best if she's not disturbed.

19
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:53,500
Dr. Scott, are you sure that Greta and David are related?

20
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,500
Could there be any chance that...
