1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
From a genetic standpoint, they both share the same, very rare,

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,900
ab-negative blood type. They must be related.

3
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:11,679
So they're really our father and daughter. I'm just hoping that...

4
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,039
Mom, I have an idea how we can find Clara. There's too many people at the banquet to

5
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:16,079
check individually,

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,239
but if we offer free health screening to all the employees

7
00:00:19,239 --> 00:00:23,600
and compare their DNA to ours, you might find a match. If none of the employees

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,120
match,

9
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:28,199
we then can extend our offer to the banquet guests, or by when we can find Clara.

10
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:31,160
That's brilliant. Let's do it.

11
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,640
Dr. Scott, your hospital can handle the screenings.

12
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,689
Of course, when you won't let your dialysis walk.

13
00:00:36,689 --> 00:00:40,289
And cover all of David's medical expenses.

14
00:00:40,289 --> 00:00:43,130
I don't want any debts left unpaid.

15
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:45,130
In other words, they'll cling to us forever.

16
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:51,740
Understood.

17
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:55,060
Clara, hold on.

18
00:00:55,060 --> 00:01:09,510
We'll be reunited soon.

19
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:13,980
No, good. I think you should quit the Walker group.

20
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,340
You know, I've always taught you that there's a

21
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:21,060
shard of goodness in everyone, but the Walker family,

22
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:26,730
maybe they're just too cruel.

23
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:28,170
Mr. Scott, you're here.

24
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:32,650
Yeah, Mrs. Walker is covering the cost to your dad's kidney transplants,

25
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:34,700
and I'll be performing surgery.

26
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:35,700
Get ready.

27
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,540
We'll do the operation in the next few days.

28
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:42,280
I do know I trust them, or who knows what they're planning this time.

29
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:47,349
Mrs. Walker is helping you to settle a debt.

30
00:01:47,349 --> 00:01:49,989
She doesn't want any ties with you in her life.

31
00:01:49,989 --> 00:01:52,140
Don't be ungrateful.

32
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,170
Dad, look, I really think you should do it.

33
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:57,969
I don't want anything to happen to you.

34
00:01:57,969 --> 00:02:00,900
Besides, I already gave my blood to Caleb.

35
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:10,479
So if you don't go through with it, then I would have suffered for nothing.

36
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,569
All right, I'll do it.

37
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:15,569
Let's just hope the walkers aren't planning to deceive us this time.

38
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:18,409
You should be grateful that you're even considering helping me.

39
00:02:18,409 --> 00:02:21,289
It is an honor for family like the Walkers,

40
00:02:21,289 --> 00:02:33,680
to help other family substitutes.

41
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,789
That looks like...
