1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.620
Skip brush on that.

2
00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:12.699
Uncle, Walker's employees just did health screenings weeks ago.

3
00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:15.699
Why are we doing another one so soon?

4
00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:20.500
This screening is different.

5
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.500
Mrs. Walker is trying to find her last child.

6
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:24.500
I lost hope.

7
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.500
You mean the third child?

8
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.559
Do you happen to have any lead?

9
00:00:29.559 --> 00:00:32.590
We've got a few hints. It might be Greta.

10
00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.979
What? Greta? That trailer trash.

11
00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:39.979
This the way. How could she?

12
00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:42.979
Uncle, are you sure you didn't make any mistakes?

13
00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:46.979
I'm not sure. I looked away for the test results to come in.

14
00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:51.979
Well, once the results are in, let me know first.

15
00:00:51.979 --> 00:01:01.219
Dr. Scott, I'm so sorry I'm late. I haven't had my screening yet.

16
00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:10.420
My waste resources on the daughter of a janitor have blood as dirty and worthless.

17
00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.810
Is it better to save it?

18
00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.959
The screening is over. You missed a chance.
