Good, and if anyone bothers you at work, you come to me. I'll handle it. Oh, and also you'll be responsible for cleaning my office every day, and bringing me my daily fruit platters. Your salary will be $10,000 a month.

00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:30,890
Um, Mrs. Walker, I, um, you saved my son's life, Greta. It's the least I can do to say thank you. And join us for dinner at my home tonight. I want Caleb to apologize to you properly.

3
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:50,939
You, you want Mr. Walker to apologize to me. He's behaved terribly in the past. He owes you an apology. It's settled. See you tonight. You regret this. You stupid bitch.

00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:59,689
Haley, what's going on? I've been bullied at the office. You've got to stand up for me.

5
00:00:59,689 --> 00:01:01,689
What? Who? Tell me who.

6
00:01:01,689 --> 00:01:08,689
It's Greta. She's not only bullied me, but she's also going to your house tonight, expecting you to apologize to her.

7
00:01:08,689 --> 00:01:28,620
That trash is trying to challenge me again. Just wait. I'm checking you out of here right now. You'll come with me tonight. I'm going to make sure she pays for this. Don't sound to her.
