00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.269
Greta, come on in.

2
00:00:06.269 --> 00:00:09.429
We agreed you'd have dinner in my place tonight, didn't we?

3
00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:11.429
Mrs. Walker, I, um...

4
00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.429
I think it's for the best if I don't.

5
00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:15.429
Greta, please let us make it up to you.

6
00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:17.429
My mom will feel terrible if you don't come.

7
00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:18.429
That's right.

8
00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:20.429
You saved Caleb's life.

9
00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:22.429
The least I can do is treat you to dinner.

10
00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:24.429
And I've lined up some jobs for your father.

11
00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:27.429
Come check it out and see what suits him best.

12
00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:28.429
Come on, get in.

13
00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:30.429
Mrs. Walker, Mrs. Walker...

14
00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:34.679
I mean, that's very generous of you, but I...

15
00:00:34.679 --> 00:00:37.259
I don't think it's proper.

16
00:00:37.259 --> 00:00:39.259
My mom has ordered a chef to whip up some dishes.

17
00:00:39.259 --> 00:00:42.259
If you don't come, all the food's going to go to waste.

18
00:00:42.259 --> 00:00:43.259
What a pity.

19
00:00:43.259 --> 00:00:44.259
Right.

20
00:00:44.259 --> 00:00:46.259
You can pack some up for your father.

21
00:00:46.259 --> 00:00:47.259
Doesn't he need nutrition?

22
00:00:47.259 --> 00:00:50.380
Okay, um...

23
00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:51.439
I'll go.

24
00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:58.109
Sit down and relax.

25
00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.109
Child and I are going to fresh it up.

26
00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:23.510
We'll be right back.

27
00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:24.799
What is it doing here?

28
00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:26.799
And Mrs. Walker find it for me?

29
00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:42.180
Rings look just like mine.
