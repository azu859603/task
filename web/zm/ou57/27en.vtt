00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.240
What are you doing?

2
00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:06.019
How dare you.

3
00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:08.140
Stealing from the Walker's family?

4
00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:09.859
No, no, I wasn't stealing.

5
00:00:09.859 --> 00:00:10.859
That ring you're wearing.

6
00:00:10.859 --> 00:00:12.980
Is that thing stolen? Take it off.

7
00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.980
You're saying that it's yours?

8
00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.100
The Truman was nice enough to invite you to her home,

9
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.219
and this is how you would pay her by stealing.

10
00:00:21.219 --> 00:00:23.379
Don't you have any shame?

11
00:00:23.379 --> 00:00:26.100
No, I didn't steal anything.

12
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.980
The ring has always been mine.

13
00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.379
Cut red-handed and you're still lying.

14
00:00:30.379 --> 00:00:32.460
Looks like I need to teach you another lesson.

15
00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.380
So this ring is yours.

16
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.380
This belongs to you.
