00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.580
So Greta's blood is avianative, just like mine, and the ring, it's...

2
00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:06.040
I understand what you're thinking.

3
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.060
I felt the same way before, but Dr. Scott confirmed it.

4
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.419
Greta inherited her avian negative blood from David.

5
00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:13.820
They are biologically father and daughter.

6
00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.960
Greta, we've been very generous with you.

7
00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.660
Paying for your father's medical bills, giving you a raise and even inviting you into our home.

8
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.309
And you repay our generosity by stealing?

9
00:00:25.309 --> 00:00:26.589
Give me the ring.

10
00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:29.679
It's not yours and you don't deserve to touch it.

11
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:30.760
No.

12
00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.759
It is my ring.

13
00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.259
I can't give it to you.

14
00:00:34.259 --> 00:00:35.259
Give me the ring.

15
00:00:35.259 --> 00:00:36.259
Hand it over.

16
00:00:36.259 --> 00:00:42.130
The dog just can't stop itself from eating trash.

17
00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.729
I should have known better than to pity someone as low as you.

18
00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:48.009
The ring really was mine.

19
00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:49.170
I got it from mine.
