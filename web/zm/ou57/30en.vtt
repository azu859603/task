00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I don't want to hear your excuses.

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Get in here and break this thief's hands.

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.419
Mom, Greta saved Caleb's life.

4
00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:11.419
So what? It was just a transaction, wasn't it?

5
00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:15.419
And I paid for all of his medical bills, didn't I?

6
00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:19.420
I thought you said you felt guilty. That's why you helped us.

7
00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:20.420
Guilty?

8
00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.829
Look at you.

9
00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:25.829
Do you think a janitor's daughter deserves my guilt?

10
00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:27.829
I only kept you around for your blood.

11
00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:29.829
You're just a walking blood bank.

12
00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:32.829
Is this what it's like to be in a wealthy family?

13
00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:37.020
No feelings, no value for anyone's life?

14
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.020
You low life talk about feelings.

15
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.149
Our feelings is something you'll never understand.

16
00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:47.149
Break her hands and get her out.

17
00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:50.149
Mom, Claire is coming home soon.

18
00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:52.149
You know that she doesn't like bloody scenes.

19
00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:54.149
Let's just not make a mess out of this.

20
00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.600
Fine.

21
00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.299
For the sake of Clara, I won't break her hands.

22
00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:08.510
But get her out. I don't need a thief dirtying up my place.

23
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.510
Go, get out.

24
00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:11.510
I'm just scared.

25
00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.090
You know, get lost.

26
00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.540
Hurry, go, before they kill.

27
00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.140
Mr. Walker, the test results are in.

28
00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.459
We found this, Claire.
