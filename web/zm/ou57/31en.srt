00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:05,809
Dr. Scott, show me. Who is she? Who is my daughter?

2
00:00:05,809 --> 00:00:14,410
Hayley is a 99% match to your DNA. Hayley is your long-lost daughter.

3
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:19,550
Me? My daughter!

4
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:29,879
Uncle, did you get back the result yet?

5
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:33,100
What? Is that trashy girl?

6
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:37,100
It's fate. It's out of the hands now. Name is called Mrs. Walker.

7
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:42,710
I don't believe in fate. I believe in myself.

8
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:49,890
And I think Mrs. Walker is a long-lost daughter.

9
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:52,890
And I could be the Walker's family's third child.

10
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,240
Will you help me, uncle?
