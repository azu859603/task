1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:07,200
It's all my fault. You were here the whole time and I didn't see it. I even scolded you earlier today. I'm so sorry

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:18,820
It's okay, mom. I'm just happy that I'm home. So Haley is our sister. That means the ring at the banquet that was lost was for yours

3
00:00:19,899 --> 00:00:26,460
So if the ring was yours, why don't you come look for its dinner? The banquet was chaotic

4
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,879
I thought I lost it somewhere else and I've been losing my mind ever since

5
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:35,280
Don't worry about that now. I'll make it up to you. Mom

6
00:00:35,979 --> 00:00:40,539
It was all Gretta's fault. We should fire her

7
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:43,990
Mom

8
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:46,090
Gretta saved Caleb's life

9
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:48,390
If we fire her now might make us look cold-hearted

10
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:53,789
Yeah, we should wait till I'm fully recovered. I mean who else we're gonna use if I hate blood later

11
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,390
She's the only one with my blood time

12
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:01,929
If you fire Greta, you'll have to find someone else for Jackson's cornea transplant. He might not buy it

13
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:04,090
Better keep her around

14
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:10,370
Mom, I just said it in the moment. Sis and Caleb are right. We should see the bigger picture here

15
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:12,129
Don't worry sweetheart

16
00:01:12,129 --> 00:01:14,200
We'll get rid of Greta soon enough

17
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:17,560
Greta you little rat. I'll make sure you're out of here
