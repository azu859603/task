00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:02.259
Hurry, get up!

2
00:00:02.259 --> 00:00:04.450
Stop slacking off.

3
00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:14.310
Hayley, this isn't my job.

4
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:16.140
Watch your mouth.

5
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.420
I'm the heiress of Walker's family now.

6
00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.239
You'll do what I say.

7
00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:23.429
We have fired.

8
00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:24.269
Okay, fine.

9
00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:37.719
I'll do it.

10
00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:38.560
Ooh!

11
00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.560
If you're sick, get lost.

12
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.600
Don't be spreading your germs around here.

13
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.880
God, are you burning up?

14
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.280
It's probably from getting soaked last night.

15
00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.200
Come on, I have to get you to the hospital.

16
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.880
I can't, I have to move these boxes.

17
00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:49.880
I need my paycheck.

18
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.159
Forget that.

19
00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:52.840
You need to get to a hospital.

20
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.000
How unlucky.

21
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.409
Running into a walking plague first thing in the morning.

22
00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:01.020
Mom, here.

23
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.060
Spray some sick girl as a pest.

24
00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:06.739
We need to get rid of her.

25
00:01:06.739 --> 00:01:13.939
Sweetheart, aren't you allergic to alcohol?

26
00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:16.099
Not anymore, Mom.

27
00:01:16.099 --> 00:01:19.700
I've got used to it after all these business meetings

28
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.920
and events I had.

29
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.640
You've been through so much, my dear.
