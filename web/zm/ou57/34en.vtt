00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:06.290
Dr. Ra, I have a question for you.

2
00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.289
If someone has been allergic to alcohol since childhood,

3
00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:13.289
can they outgrow it once they get older?

4
00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:17.289
Alcohol allergy is caused by a lack of acetaldehyde dehydrogenase.

5
00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:20.289
At most, the symptoms may lessen a bit over time,

6
00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:23.289
but it's a genetic issue that can't be fully overcome.

7
00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:27.570
But, but what about drinking?

8
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.600
Can they still drink alcohol?

9
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.600
Definitely not.

10
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.600
For someone with this kind of allergy,

11
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.630
even a little bit of alcohol can lend them in the hospital.

12
00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:40.270
Hailey, is she really my sister?

13
00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.270
Here's the prescription for Greta.

14
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.270
She's definitely allergic to alcohol.

15
00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.270
I even have to be careful with the disinfectant I use,

16
00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.270
or she breaks out into hives.

17
00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.229
So, God has a pleasure to alcohol.

18
00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:56.119
But, Hailey, thanks.

19
00:00:56.119 --> 00:01:02.060
This is for you to try on.

20
00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.060
Aww, thank you so much, sister.

21
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:10.609
Can you please help me unzip this dress?

22
00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:17.439
Thank you.

23
00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:21.890
This is Hailey's hair, compared to the ones that I gave you before.

24
00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.890
Also, bring it to a reputable hospital for another DNA test.

25
00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.099
I want this all under the wraps,

26
00:01:29.099 --> 00:01:31.099
and I want you all for looking everything.

27
00:01:31.099 --> 00:01:42.099
David's medical and nutritional costs probably cost 50,000.

28
00:01:42.099 --> 00:01:44.099
We've ridden 500,000.

29
00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:46.099
So, will this raise suspicion of the walkers?

30
00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:52.200
Well, the extra 450,000 is for us.

31
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.200
You take 200, and I'll keep the rest.

32
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.329
My credit card's bill's been maxed out.

33
00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:00.329
So, I have to cover the charges.

34
00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.329
As for David's treatments, just those numbers.

35
00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:11.159
Dr. Scott, I'm here to have Caleb's injuries checked out.

36
00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:12.449
Sweetheart.

37
00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:14.449
Mom, what are you doing here?

38
00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:18.060
I knew Greta was shady.

39
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.060
That's why after I heard you say that

40
00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.060
the walkers' family is going to cover David's medical bills,

41
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.539
I got worried and I came to check,

42
00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:29.539
and I found something really wrong.

43
00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:33.490
500,000?

44
00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:34.620
What?

45
00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.620
The emergency surgery after my car accident didn't cost us much.

46
00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.259
Why does David need 500,000?

47
00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:42.259
Exactly.

48
00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:44.259
We've been kind enough to cover David's bills,

49
00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:47.259
and Greta's been treating us for fools.

50
00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:49.259
Thank God I caught it in time.

51
00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:52.259
Her father and daughter are really nothing but trouble.

52
00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:57.840
I also deal with them.

53
00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.840
Your dad's recovery is going well.

54
00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.840
Another week of rest and some antibiotics,

55
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.080
and he should be ready to go home.

56
00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.080
What's going on?

57
00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.099
Give no idea what you've done.

58
00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:12.099
We agreed to cover your father's medical expenses,

59
00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:16.099
and in just a few days you racked up over 500,000 dollars.

60
00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:18.099
Do you think we're idiots?

61
00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:20.099
This isn't right.

62
00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:23.099
My father hasn't used expensive medication.

63
00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:25.099
Mrs. Walker, there must be a mistake.

64
00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:26.550
This isn't right.

65
00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:27.550
This doesn't add up.

66
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:31.550
I'm David's primary doctor, and I've only been giving him some basic antibiotics.

67
00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.550
The high-end drugs on this bill.

68
00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.550
They wouldn't even help this condition.

69
00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:40.550
Those expensive drugs, Greta must have as the nurses to order them,

70
00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:42.550
then sell them off the market.

71
00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:43.550
I've seen her do it.

72
00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:44.550
That's true.

73
00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.550
I've seen Greta pick up drugs a few times.

74
00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.550
That's not true. You're framing me.

75
00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:50.550
No.

76
00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:52.550
We have witnesses and evidence.

77
00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.550
We're still trying to deny it, stealing a diamond hairpin,

78
00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.550
and a ring, and now this.

79
00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.710
You're a thief, through and through.

80
00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:03.870
I'm cutting off all care to David.

81
00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.870
Effective immediately.

82
00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.060
Mrs. Walker, please jump.

83
00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.060
This isn't critical time for my father's recovery,

84
00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.060
and without antibiotics, an infection could completely throw him off track.

85
00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.060
The fate of your kind is none of my concern.

86
00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.060
Mrs. Walker, please!

87
00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:32.290
Greta, need to figure out how to get those antibiotics quickly or else.

88
00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:34.449
My blood's rare, I could sell that.

89
00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:38.449
Your blood is rare, but not as many people can use AB negative blood,

90
00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:42.449
so it's actually less valuable than more common blood types.

91
00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:50.459
You mean, buddy?

92
00:04:50.459 --> 00:04:52.819
You know he can always come to me, okay?

93
00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:54.819
All you have to do is beg.

94
00:04:54.819 --> 00:04:58.259
Give me your cornea, and I'll give you half a million.

95
00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:00.259
Your dad doesn't get those antibiotics soon.

96
00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:02.259
He's gonna die from an infection.

97
00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:06.519
He's having a post-surgery rejection reaction.

98
00:05:06.519 --> 00:05:08.519
We need those antibiotics now.

99
00:05:08.519 --> 00:05:10.519
One word, Greta.

100
00:05:10.519 --> 00:05:12.519
Donate, or I'm out of here.

101
00:05:12.519 --> 00:05:14.519
Okay, I'll donate.

102
00:05:14.519 --> 00:05:16.519
Just whatever you want.

103
00:05:16.519 --> 00:05:17.519
Just say.

104
00:05:17.519 --> 00:05:19.519
Then sign the contract.

105
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.620
Can I have the money now?

106
00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:31.620
Here.

107
00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:32.620
30,000.

108
00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.680
It's supposed to be 100,000.

109
00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:35.680
Why only 30?

110
00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.680
Well, that was the old price.

111
00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:38.680
I've trained you my mind.

112
00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:39.680
30 so you get.

113
00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.680
You're just manipulating me.

114
00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.680
Greta, take it or leave it, okay?

115
00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.680
But you sign the contract.

116
00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.680
So you still hold me your cornea,

117
00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.660
or do you take my money or not?

118
00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:53.660
Please, doctor.

119
00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:55.660
Just do what you can.

120
00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:56.730
Let's go.

121
00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:01.160
You can have my cornea.

122
00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.160
Are you sick?

123
00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.740
Doc, if she's unwell, will this wreck my eyesight?

124
00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.740
It might be Greta's week,

125
00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:09.740
and she's still recovering from a fever.

126
00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.740
The cornea might be of poor quality

127
00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:14.740
and could even carry potential diseases.

128
00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.740
Buying, okay? You got one week.

129
00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:28.120
Then I'm coming back to your cornea.

130
00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.120
She's got the $500,000 medical bill for David.

131
00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.120
It doesn't seem right.

132
00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:48.540
Test results.

133
00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:53.019
What's Greta's test results doing here?

134
00:06:53.019 --> 00:06:56.720
What do you think you're doing?

135
00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.980
Aurora, who said you can go through my things?

136
00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:02.980
I was just, I just came in to talk about David's bill

137
00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:03.980
and you weren't here.

138
00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:04.980
Stick to your job.

139
00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:06.980
And don't get involved with things that don't concern you

140
00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:08.980
otherwise I will fire you.

141
00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:12.980
But this $500,000 bill is not what David used.

142
00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:14.980
The walk is not going to miss that money.

143
00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:17.360
This is your final warning.

144
00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.360
Don't get involved with things that don't concern you

145
00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.360
and don't stick your neck out for someone like David

146
00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.360
otherwise you'll regret it.

147
00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.360
Get out.

148
00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:29.560
Mrs. Walker,

149
00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:32.720
there's the information you asked for on Greta and her father.

150
00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:33.720
This confirms it.

151
00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.720
Greta isn't David's biological daughter.

152
00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.720
Mom, you don't think Greta could be?

153
00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.720
Yes, already been found.

154
00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.720
And the DNA matched perfectly.

155
00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:46.500
Hailey is my daughter.

156
00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:47.500
Greta's just a thief.

157
00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:50.500
There's no way she has a connection to the Walker family.

158
00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:56.089
Let her fend for herself.

159
00:07:56.089 --> 00:07:58.339
Once we get out of here,

160
00:07:58.339 --> 00:08:01.399
we're going to look for your real parents.

161
00:08:01.399 --> 00:08:03.399
I've made such a mock of things.

162
00:08:03.399 --> 00:08:05.399
You've really suffered enough.

163
00:08:05.399 --> 00:08:09.399
David, Greta isn't your biological daughter?

164
00:08:09.399 --> 00:08:12.399
No woman ever wanted to marry a poor man like me,

165
00:08:12.399 --> 00:08:14.399
let alone have children with me.

166
00:08:14.399 --> 00:08:17.500
And one day, 15 years ago,

167
00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:19.500
someone dumped this little bug here

168
00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:21.500
and right next to a dumpster I was working at,

169
00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:23.529
she was a blood dry.

170
00:08:23.529 --> 00:08:26.740
When I picked her up,

171
00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:30.100
I saved her life and I brought her up with my own.

172
00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:33.659
That'll always be your daughter.

173
00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:35.659
It can't be.

174
00:08:35.659 --> 00:08:38.659
The Walker family's lost daughter has already been found.

175
00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:41.659
I shouldn't bring more chaos to this father and daughter.

176
00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:44.659
So, Dr. Ora, how's my dad doing?

177
00:08:44.659 --> 00:08:46.659
His condition has stabilized.

178
00:08:46.659 --> 00:08:48.659
There's no longer a need for antibiotics

179
00:08:48.659 --> 00:08:50.659
and he can recover at home.

180
00:08:50.659 --> 00:08:52.659
Stay in here, we'll just drain your money.

181
00:08:52.659 --> 00:08:54.659
I'll prescribe some anti-inflammatory meds.

182
00:08:54.659 --> 00:08:58.659
Take those as directed and he should be good in a few days.

183
00:08:58.659 --> 00:08:59.659
Okay, great.

184
00:08:59.659 --> 00:09:16.159
I'm gonna go get you just charged then.

185
00:09:16.159 --> 00:09:17.159
Jackson Jackson.

186
00:09:17.159 --> 00:09:20.669
Greta here is just charging her father early.

187
00:09:20.669 --> 00:09:23.669
Well, looks like they're running away with his really grand.

188
00:09:23.669 --> 00:09:24.669
Hello, bitch.

189
00:09:24.669 --> 00:09:33.259
No one gives me to leave.

190
00:09:33.259 --> 00:09:35.259
Mr. Hill, what are you doing here?

191
00:09:35.259 --> 00:09:38.259
See, you guys think you could just take my money and run.

192
00:09:38.259 --> 00:09:43.179
You must just be praying for death, huh?

193
00:09:43.179 --> 00:09:44.179
We weren't running.

194
00:09:44.179 --> 00:09:48.179
My dad was feeling better, so we wanted to go home and save money.

195
00:09:48.179 --> 00:09:50.179
What did you promise them?

196
00:09:50.179 --> 00:09:53.179
Your daughter promised to sell me one of her corners for $30,000.

197
00:09:53.179 --> 00:09:55.179
Just to pay for your surgery.

198
00:09:55.179 --> 00:09:56.179
Take mine.

199
00:09:56.179 --> 00:09:58.179
You're the Crippen mess.

200
00:09:58.179 --> 00:10:00.179
Well, I don't want your eyes.

201
00:10:00.179 --> 00:10:03.039
Get in my way again.

202
00:10:03.039 --> 00:10:06.889
I'll kill you.

203
00:10:06.889 --> 00:10:11.220
No, I don't want your mind.

204
00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:16.100
Jackson, what are you doing?

205
00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:19.100
This bitch took my $30 grand and tried to run.

206
00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:20.100
I caught her in yet.

207
00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:22.100
Charlotte, mind your business.

208
00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:23.679
Mrs. Walker.

209
00:10:23.679 --> 00:10:27.679
I gave Mr. Walker my blood and doesn't that mean anything?

210
00:10:27.679 --> 00:10:28.679
Please.

211
00:10:28.679 --> 00:10:33.190
I'll give Mr. Walker my blood for the rest of my life if you just help my dad.

212
00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:36.190
Mom, my blood type matches Walker's.

213
00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:37.190
We don't need Greta's.

214
00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:39.190
Plus, her blood is dirty.

215
00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:41.190
We don't know what diseases she's carrying.

216
00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:42.190
You're right.

217
00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:44.190
Get back in the car.

218
00:10:44.190 --> 00:11:29.529
My private clinic doc, transplant lined up.

219
00:11:29.529 --> 00:11:32.679
So you managed to get Greta, huh?

220
00:11:32.679 --> 00:11:34.679
Congratulations.

221
00:11:34.679 --> 00:11:37.809
You really used to have blood type to save me negative.

222
00:11:37.809 --> 00:11:40.100
And it's a risky surgery if something were to go wrong.

223
00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:41.100
She'd lost too much blood.

224
00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:42.100
She could die.

225
00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:43.100
Who cares if she dies?

226
00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:45.100
Name your price.

227
00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:46.100
Hunter Grant.

228
00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:47.100
Deal?

229
00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:48.100
Deal.

230
00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:49.100
Get over here.

231
00:11:49.100 --> 00:12:04.080
Fast.

232
00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:05.080
Greta's in danger.

233
00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:06.299
What do I do?

234
00:12:06.299 --> 00:12:15.940
99.999% match with Mrs. Walker.

235
00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:20.480
Could this Greta be Greta?

236
00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:26.460
Could she be the real Walker daughter?

237
00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:28.460
I have to warn Mrs. Walker.

238
00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:36.179
Immediately.

239
00:12:36.179 --> 00:12:43.179
Mom, since both my sister and my brother have their own companies to manage, I want to help you out as well.

240
00:12:43.179 --> 00:12:45.179
Give me a company to run.

241
00:12:45.179 --> 00:12:47.179
I promise I won't lay it down.

242
00:12:47.179 --> 00:12:51.179
Yeah, we are very lucky to have Claire back in the family.

243
00:12:51.179 --> 00:12:52.179
Perhaps you could give-

244
00:12:52.179 --> 00:12:57.179
As a good leader, you need to either be able to dominate Los Angeles' business world.

245
00:12:57.179 --> 00:13:02.179
Or to know people, knowing your own employees, and those around you well.

246
00:13:02.179 --> 00:13:03.179
What's-

247
00:13:03.179 --> 00:13:04.179
What's that supposed to mean?

248
00:13:04.179 --> 00:13:07.179
Today, we had the opportunity to help Greta.

249
00:13:07.179 --> 00:13:11.179
She's a company employee, and she even helped donate her own blood to save Caleb.

250
00:13:11.179 --> 00:13:14.179
And yet, you still persuaded Mom to let her die.

251
00:13:14.179 --> 00:13:16.179
You don't have what it takes to manage a company.

252
00:13:16.179 --> 00:13:18.179
Greta is just a thief.

253
00:13:18.179 --> 00:13:21.179
Why should we even care about a thief's life?

254
00:13:21.179 --> 00:13:23.179
It's just Jack's inside of the story.

255
00:13:23.179 --> 00:13:24.179
Enough, Charlotte.

256
00:13:24.179 --> 00:13:28.179
We don't let outsiders affect the unity of the Walker family.

257
00:13:28.179 --> 00:13:34.559
Sweetheart, I will grant you wish and give you a promising company to manage.

258
00:13:34.559 --> 00:13:36.330
Myth?

259
00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:39.330
This is the Virginia Test result for Mrs. Walker and Miss Haley.

260
00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:42.330
Charlotte, what's this about?

261
00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:44.330
Dr. Scott's report lacked credibility.

262
00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:53.330
So, I send samples of Mom and Sister to the most reputable hospital in Los Angeles for a proper DNA test.

263
00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:57.720
You-

264
00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:58.720
You don't trust me.

265
00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:03.230
You're questioning my- my identity?

266
00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:07.230
Whether you belong to this family, it will be clear once we see the report.

267
00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:09.840
Why do you look so upset?

268
00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:16.549
I was abandoned as a child.

269
00:14:16.549 --> 00:14:20.899
I struggled so much growing up on my own.

270
00:14:20.899 --> 00:14:25.480
And now that I finally found my mother and I came back home,

271
00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:27.769
my sister is doubting me.

272
00:14:27.769 --> 00:14:32.899
If you think I'm a threat and a burden to your inheritance,

273
00:14:32.899 --> 00:14:35.570
I'll just leave.

274
00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:36.570
No.

275
00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:38.980
Sweetheart, don't go.

276
00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:39.980
I believe you.

277
00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:42.980
I lost you for so many years I cannot lose you again.

278
00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:46.870
Take it and burn it.

279
00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:48.870
I don't want to see that report for one more second.

280
00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:49.870
Hold on.

281
00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:55.190
We all know that my sister was allergic to alcohol, right?

282
00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:57.190
I consulted with Dr. Ora.

283
00:14:57.190 --> 00:14:59.190
Alcohol allergy is genetic.

284
00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:02.350
It can't just disappear overnight.

285
00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:04.350
And yet, she's not even allergic to alcohol.

286
00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:05.350
She can even drink it.

287
00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:07.350
Isn't that a little bit suspicious?

288
00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:10.350
What's there to be suspicious about?

289
00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:16.350
Maybe Dr. Ora is in a skilled or trained as all the other doctors who've treated me.

290
00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:19.350
If you don't believe me, I'll just leave.

291
00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:22.830
I've always been an outsider to this family anyways, no?

292
00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:25.120
What's the point of staying?

293
00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:29.120
My dear sister, don't go. I believe you.

294
00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:36.799
Mrs. Walker, Haley isn't your daughter.

295
00:15:36.799 --> 00:15:42.429
Dr. Ora, do you realize what you're saying?

296
00:15:42.429 --> 00:15:45.429
I found this in Dr. Scott's office.

297
00:15:45.429 --> 00:15:50.429
The part that wasn't burned shows a 99.99% DNA match,

298
00:15:50.429 --> 00:15:55.299
but the name was destroyed, leaving only Greta.

299
00:15:55.299 --> 00:15:58.299
I suspect that to be Greta.

300
00:15:58.299 --> 00:16:02.299
David told us that Greta wasn't his biological daughter.

301
00:16:02.299 --> 00:16:07.299
He found her left by his truck, almost drained of blood.

302
00:16:07.299 --> 00:16:10.299
He saved her with the transfusion.

303
00:16:10.299 --> 00:16:13.299
Greta, could be Clara?

304
00:16:13.299 --> 00:16:21.730
My dear daughter, my traitor so badly, it is my ring.

305
00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:23.730
I can't give it to you.

306
00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:26.730
Break her hands and get her out.

307
00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:32.429
I'll give Mr. Walker my blood for the rest of my life if you just help my dad.

308
00:16:32.429 --> 00:16:45.490
You're pretty much wrong. It's fake.

309
00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:49.860
I'd rather believe Haley is my sister.

310
00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:54.409
You. You liar. Our shame was up to you.

311
00:16:54.409 --> 00:16:58.409
You've been impersonating my sister this whole time, accusing her of death,

312
00:16:58.409 --> 00:17:00.409
encouraging me to bully her and driving her away.

313
00:17:00.409 --> 00:17:04.920
That's right. Greta is your real sister.

314
00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:07.920
She is the Walker's family's third child.

315
00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:13.339
So what? She's going blind, and she'll never be as good as me.

316
00:17:13.339 --> 00:17:17.819
What if you don't? Speak. I will kill you!

317
00:17:17.819 --> 00:17:20.819
Jackson probably took Clara to get her corny as removed.

318
00:17:20.819 --> 00:17:22.880
We have to save her.

319
00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:31.960
Greta, where is Greta? Where is your daughter?

320
00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:36.170
She is my daughter.

321
00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:39.170
The daughter I lost 15 years ago. It was all my fault.

322
00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:42.170
And I swear this time. I'll make sure she doesn't get hurt.

323
00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:50.099
Come on, Jackson. You bastard answer the phone and throw her in your family.

324
00:17:50.099 --> 00:17:52.099
I know that's where she's almost started.

325
00:17:52.099 --> 00:17:57.099
It's too late. You can't save her. Greta's going blind.

326
00:17:57.099 --> 00:18:02.799
Anyway, I've been to my sister. I swear to God, I will kill you.

327
00:18:02.799 --> 00:18:05.859
Mrs. Walker, we've located Miss Clara.

328
00:18:05.859 --> 00:18:10.700
Jackson took her to a private hospital. We've locked down the location.

329
00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:14.700
Good, good. We need to get to the hospital. We have to stop Jackson.

330
00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:20.940
Mr. Hill, she's lost a lot of blood. We're moving the corny. It could be fatal.

331
00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:23.940
I only care about her corny, as your life means nothing.

332
00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:24.940
But Jesus...

333
00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:27.940
Stop wasting my time to get on with it. Do you want your honor, Grant?

334
00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:28.940
Not.

335
00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:38.859
I can't die. My dying woman will take care of my father.

336
00:18:38.859 --> 00:18:40.859
I still need to find my mother and I.

337
00:18:40.859 --> 00:18:44.119
They both die. It's out of my hands.

338
00:18:44.119 --> 00:18:51.920
No. I'm leaving.

339
00:18:51.920 --> 00:19:23.140
Clara, I'll protect you.

340
00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:25.490
I'm jamming her upset. You can tell me.

341
00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:49.390
To my daughter, I'll make sure your health family is wiped off with that.

342
00:19:49.390 --> 00:20:00.809
Sis? Sister? Come on, wake up.

343
00:20:00.809 --> 00:20:03.220
What the hell are you doing? Why are you here?

344
00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:06.220
She is Clara. She's my lost sister.

345
00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:08.220
The Walker family's third daughter.

346
00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:11.250
No, that... Hailey was supposed to be.

347
00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:15.660
That conniving snake doctored the DNA before it.

348
00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:17.660
How dare she crunty think it might tell her.

349
00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:22.660
Mrs. Walker, do you know everything? Please forgive me. Hailey forced me to do it. Please, miss!

350
00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:26.140
Forgive you?

351
00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:28.140
Were you thinking of forgiveness when you conspired with Hailey?

352
00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:32.140
Were you thinking of forgiveness when you were about to take my daughter's corny eyes?

353
00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:35.140
You two are going to rot in prison for this.

354
00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:38.829
So scared.

355
00:20:38.829 --> 00:20:43.779
It's so cold.

356
00:20:43.779 --> 00:20:47.849
She's so cold.

357
00:20:47.849 --> 00:20:49.849
So why are you doing this to me?

358
00:20:49.849 --> 00:20:52.849
It's her. She remembers.

359
00:20:52.849 --> 00:20:54.849
Sis, she remembers us.

360
00:20:54.849 --> 00:20:56.849
No, I didn't steal the rings.

361
00:20:56.849 --> 00:21:00.099
It was a token of a ring.

362
00:21:00.099 --> 00:21:02.099
But I still remember him that night.

363
00:21:02.099 --> 00:21:06.930
Clara, Clara, it's really you, Clara.

364
00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:09.930
Yeah. I was wrong. I'm so sorry.

365
00:21:09.930 --> 00:21:11.930
She really is Clara.

366
00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:14.380
She was my sister.

367
00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:16.730
What have I done?

368
00:21:16.730 --> 00:21:22.450
Doctor, Clara, please save my daughter.

369
00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:25.450
I'm willing to do anything for you to save my daughter.

370
00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:30.450
Miss Clara has lost a lot of blood. She needs an immediate transfusion and a lot of it.

371
00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:32.450
Take my.

372
00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:33.450
Take my.

373
00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:39.450
Mr. Walker, you're still recovering from the car accident. Donating blood now would be life threatening.

374
00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:43.450
If anything would have happened to you, there'd be no blood left to save you.

375
00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:50.750
Doctor, 15 years ago, she drained herself of blood to save me.

376
00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:54.039
But then she was abandoned and lost the time.

377
00:21:54.039 --> 00:21:57.390
But I bullied her, humiliated her.

378
00:21:57.390 --> 00:22:02.549
When I was in the car accident, she gave me her blood she was died.

379
00:22:02.549 --> 00:22:05.619
Sister, I'm here now. I promise to protect you.

380
00:22:05.619 --> 00:22:10.089
She almost died twice, trying to save me.

381
00:22:10.089 --> 00:22:13.089
Now it's my turn to do it for her, even if I die, Troy.

382
00:22:13.089 --> 00:22:24.319
Doctor, please save her. I have to make this right.

383
00:22:24.319 --> 00:22:27.319
Doctor Aurora, why isn't my daughter waking up?

384
00:22:27.319 --> 00:22:30.319
When will she wake up? She's been through too much trauma.

385
00:22:30.319 --> 00:22:33.319
Her brain has entered a self-protective state.

386
00:22:33.319 --> 00:22:36.319
I'm not sure when or if she'll wake up.

387
00:22:36.319 --> 00:22:43.700
It's on my fault.

388
00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:48.980
But I needed you the most. I wasn't there for you.

389
00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:56.049
I even hurt you, but Clara, it's your daughter.

390
00:22:56.049 --> 00:23:00.359
For as long as it takes.

391
00:23:00.359 --> 00:23:04.380
I will stay right here by your side.

392
00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:14.099
Sis, you've been asleep for a week.

393
00:23:14.099 --> 00:23:17.519
Today's your birthday and I got you your favorite strawberry cake.

394
00:23:17.519 --> 00:23:20.700
Please wake up, Sis.

395
00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:24.619
Gotta...

396
00:23:24.619 --> 00:23:28.779
Gotta have the Walker family already cured my illness.

397
00:23:28.779 --> 00:23:30.779
And they got me a job.

398
00:23:30.779 --> 00:23:33.009
Please wake up.

399
00:23:33.009 --> 00:23:36.539
She will wake up.

400
00:23:36.539 --> 00:23:40.490
She's waking up.

401
00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:42.740
Clara's finger's moved.

402
00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:51.150
Doctor, quick. My daughter's waking up.

403
00:23:51.150 --> 00:23:53.150
Clara, can you please come out and see us.

404
00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:55.180
We really miss you.

405
00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:58.309
Sweetheart, come out and see your mom.

406
00:23:58.309 --> 00:24:00.309
I'll do anything you ask. Just...

407
00:24:00.309 --> 00:24:04.140
Let me take a look at you.

408
00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:05.140
My dad eats some.

409
00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:06.140
It's gone.

410
00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:07.710
Try to.

411
00:24:07.710 --> 00:24:09.710
You do remember your past, though, right?

412
00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:10.710
No.

413
00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:12.710
You should go out and see them.

414
00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:18.440
They come every day. Rain or shine to see you.

415
00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:20.440
Maybe there's a shard of goodness.

416
00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:24.849
Maybe they've learned their mistakes.

417
00:24:24.849 --> 00:24:25.849
No.

418
00:24:25.849 --> 00:24:27.849
Dad, look at my family.

419
00:24:27.849 --> 00:24:30.069
Always and forever.

420
00:24:30.069 --> 00:24:33.539
Yeah, Sis.

421
00:24:33.539 --> 00:24:35.539
Please, mom, this is so much.

422
00:24:35.539 --> 00:24:38.640
She's so heartbroken. She can barely eat or sleep.

423
00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:41.019
It's my relationship.

424
00:24:41.019 --> 00:24:43.569
You might not survive my family.

425
00:24:43.569 --> 00:24:47.259
You have to come out and see me.

426
00:24:47.259 --> 00:24:49.259
You finally had to see us.

427
00:24:49.259 --> 00:24:52.259
Mrs. Walker, now you've seen me.

428
00:24:52.259 --> 00:24:55.809
Please don't come near me and my father ever again.

429
00:24:55.809 --> 00:24:59.380
Darling, I was wrong.

430
00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:01.420
Please don't be angry with me.

431
00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:04.420
Clara, don't do this. Please, give us a chance.

432
00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:07.420
Miss Charlotte, I appreciate everything you've done for me in the past.

433
00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:13.559
I really do, but I will never forgive these two ever again.

434
00:25:13.559 --> 00:25:17.559
So, like I said, don't bother us. Again, Clara.

435
00:25:17.559 --> 00:25:21.869
Do you really hate me that much?

436
00:25:21.869 --> 00:25:22.869
Yes.

437
00:25:22.869 --> 00:25:26.700
Leave. Now.

438
00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:34.089
Mom. Clara.

439
00:25:34.089 --> 00:25:38.089
Mom booked the most expensive hotel in Los Angeles for your return.

440
00:25:38.089 --> 00:25:41.089
We'll send a driver to you and your father tomorrow at noon.

441
00:25:41.089 --> 00:25:44.759
Please. You have to come.

442
00:25:44.759 --> 00:25:48.700
Clara?

443
00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:51.089
Mom, don't push it.

444
00:25:51.089 --> 00:25:53.089
Let's not push her anymore.

445
00:25:53.089 --> 00:25:55.089
She needs some time to herself.

446
00:25:55.089 --> 00:25:57.700
Right? Come on.

447
00:25:57.700 --> 00:26:06.839
Mom, she'll come. She has to.

448
00:26:06.839 --> 00:26:10.160
Yeah, Mom. She still cares about us.

449
00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:14.539
We're so close to this family, we're kids.

450
00:26:14.539 --> 00:26:15.539
Did you find her?

451
00:26:15.539 --> 00:26:18.539
When I arrived, the place was already emptied. They left this.

452
00:26:18.539 --> 00:26:21.539
What?

453
00:26:21.539 --> 00:26:27.549
I'm gone. Don't come looking for me.

454
00:26:27.549 --> 00:26:30.549
Don't say you love me or want to make it up to me.

455
00:26:30.549 --> 00:26:32.579
Ask yourselves.

456
00:26:32.579 --> 00:26:36.579
If I wasn't Clara, would I have died on that operating table?

457
00:26:36.579 --> 00:26:39.579
Would my father have died from his illness?

458
00:26:39.579 --> 00:26:44.220
I don't want to be Clara or a walker.

459
00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:47.220
I just want to be Greta, the janitor's daughter.

460
00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:51.019
As for you, let's pretend we never met.

461
00:26:51.019 --> 00:26:53.150
Never knew each other.

462
00:26:53.150 --> 00:26:54.700
Goodbye.

463
00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:59.150
Mom!

464
00:26:59.150 --> 00:27:05.400
Mom!

465
00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:13.400
Yesterday, Walker Group's chairman, Emma Walker, announced that she has donated all her assets to establish the Clara Assistance Foundation, which will help those in need across all social sectors.

466
00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:19.400
But Kayla Borka and Charlotte Walker will serve as volunteers, partially involved in the foundation's activities.

467
00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:22.400
Greta, it's time to meet.

468
00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:26.720
Dad, you brought me lunch. I told you there's a cafeteria here.

469
00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:30.720
I know, but new environments, you know, different food.

470
00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:35.720
You can be a particular little bug, so I have brought here quite a few of your food.

471
00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:40.720
Thanks, Dad. Okay, let's go eat.

472
00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:42.750
Alright, so what did you bring me?
