1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,189
Hi, table for two please.

2
00:00:03,189 --> 00:00:06,719
I'm sorry about what we have booked until the end of the year.

3
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:10,710
Fancy restaurants are always so busy.

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:20,170
This was just a wasted trip.

5
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:25,899
Of course. Please, this way to the VIP section.

6
00:00:25,899 --> 00:00:28,899
Wow, you really have some influence here.

7
00:00:28,899 --> 00:00:37,939
You must bring all of your customers here.

8
00:00:37,939 --> 00:00:39,939
I'll just have this thank you.

9
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:43,020
Oh, certainly.

10
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:47,359
I didn't understand what the menu said,

11
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:50,359
but I think the first line were the special dishes.

12
00:00:53,409 --> 00:00:54,409
Excuse me, miss.

13
00:00:54,409 --> 00:00:55,409
You're on the catch-off.

14
00:00:55,409 --> 00:00:56,600
Uh...

15
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,600
Any requests?

16
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,920
Uh...

17
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,920
Uh...

18
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,920
Volvicki are there.

19
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,920
Uh...

20
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,920
They have la finiche, la coda de Bianca.

21
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,140
Yes, sir. We just got it.

22
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,659
We'll start with the white phoenix tailfish,

23
00:01:10,659 --> 00:01:14,659
and then to have to start, we'll have the American ham.

24
00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:16,819
Certainly, sir.

25
00:01:16,819 --> 00:01:19,939
Miss, you have excellent taste.
