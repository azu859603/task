1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:04,080
Shh, are you okay, do you need some help?

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,440
Yeah. Oh, this way please.

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,480
Oh, yeah. Sure, good.

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,279
Hey, Elsa!

5
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:11,080
Oh. Oh.

6
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,080
I just know you worked in England.

7
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,080
I'm...

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,080
What a coincidence.

9
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,079
Thank you so much for hanging out with me the other day.

10
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:19,480
Come, let's go grab food.

11
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,480
Oh, have a good one.

12
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,079
No, let's get the tube.

13
00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:25,079
It's faster and cheaper.

14
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:26,079
Oh, no, no, no.

15
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:27,079
Hey!

16
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:28,079
My lipstick.

17
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:29,079
Oh, sorry.

18
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:36,579
Hey, sausage.

19
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:37,579
It's my favor.

20
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:38,579
Oh.

21
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:47,240
This is even better to be embarrassed to come.

22
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,240
Really?

23
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,369
You don't like it?

24
00:00:49,369 --> 00:00:50,570
I can go and grab you some more.
