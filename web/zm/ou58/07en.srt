1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,240
Oh, it's in fact a Hubella.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:07,040
You're always just still playing you to save money for your wedding.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,080
But even after being tutored, you still look so shabby.

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:14,679
Oh, Cindy, you've changed quite a lot.

5
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:16,519
Quite a bit of work done in your face.

6
00:00:16,519 --> 00:00:19,030
Why I always didn't recognise you.

7
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:21,429
You're just good with words.

8
00:00:21,429 --> 00:00:24,910
Everyone else would have failed engagement.

9
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:27,109
Still saying no?

10
00:00:27,109 --> 00:00:28,390
Not true.

11
00:00:28,469 --> 00:00:30,149
I've got a boyfriend now.

12
00:00:30,149 --> 00:00:34,189
He's taller, handsome, and richer than my ex.

13
00:00:34,189 --> 00:00:36,280
Oh, great.

14
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,280
Will you talk about answering you tomorrow then?

15
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,280
Sure, I will.

16
00:00:46,920 --> 00:01:07,209
By the way, how much do you earn?

17
00:01:07,209 --> 00:01:08,780
No offence.

18
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:12,099
I was just wondering if you'd be my boyfriend of the day.

19
00:01:12,099 --> 00:01:14,379
I'll pay you Â£200.
