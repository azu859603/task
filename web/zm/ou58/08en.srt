1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:06,780
Wow! That ranted suit is quite impressive, but your tie's a little bit crooked.

2
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,660
Why do you pick out a dress?

3
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:26,329
Or maybe I should buy one for you.

4
00:00:26,329 --> 00:00:28,329
Acting just like a qualified boyfriend.

5
00:00:28,329 --> 00:00:30,329
Keep it up tomorrow.

6
00:00:30,329 --> 00:00:57,259
I'm very sorry, but I can't do it tomorrow.

7
00:00:57,259 --> 00:01:01,979
I can shine on my own.

8
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:09,670
It's too far.

9
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:12,769
Isn't there too much of a show?

10
00:01:12,769 --> 00:01:16,280
You didn't tell me it was going to be a picnic.

11
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,280
Well, where's your boyfriend?

12
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,569
He, uh, he couldn't make it.

13
00:01:21,569 --> 00:01:23,950
Couldn't make it.

14
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:27,489
Well, just doesn't exist.

15
00:01:27,489 --> 00:01:29,489
He used to be the beauty of our school, Bella.

16
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:31,489
What happened to you?

17
00:01:31,489 --> 00:01:33,099
Right?

18
00:01:33,099 --> 00:01:36,099
We were classmates, but this way.

19
00:01:36,099 --> 00:01:38,099
We won't be no illegally anymore.

20
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:41,469
You're not welcome at all, I really need.

21
00:01:41,469 --> 00:01:44,109
But to leave quickly.
