1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:03,620
So, you're missing everything, I love you.

2
00:00:04,459 --> 00:00:05,299
You've got a bit of food?

3
00:00:05,299 --> 00:00:06,139
Yeah.

4
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,779
Fun. Why would you take people over this to me?

5
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:16,140
In my world, isn't it usually followed by a can?

6
00:00:17,079 --> 00:00:19,960
200k? A day?

7
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,329
Harry, we're going to be late in front of us.

8
00:00:34,329 --> 00:00:37,250
Hey, who's kisses?

9
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,250
Better. You're late for work.

10
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,250
You're missing your allowance for the day, it's punishment.

11
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,250
But, supervisor, there's a boy here.

12
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,250
Is there a brother?

13
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:48,250
Bring your family to work costs Â£100 fine.

14
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:51,310
Supervisor, he's not my brother.

15
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:56,490
Aaron's. Do you have that contact?

16
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,869
My mum left me when I was a child.

17
00:00:58,869 --> 00:01:03,859
Everyone I meet, laughs at me.

18
00:01:03,859 --> 00:01:07,090
It's okay. Is there anything I can do?

19
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:08,090
I'm really hungry, really.

20
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:10,090
Let's go grab something.

21
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:12,909
Okay.

22
00:01:12,909 --> 00:01:15,909
Boss, the new interview was late for work,

23
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,909
and she even brought her family to the office.

24
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:19,909
It's very unprofessional.

25
00:01:19,909 --> 00:01:23,620
Our company promotes flexible working hours.

26
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:30,650
Besides, employees who have care into what some of the teas are allowed to bring in their family if they need to.

27
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:33,650
Instead of nitpicking your colleagues, focus on your own work.

28
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:38,760
I have to go pick up my uncle on the day.

29
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,760
Finish off the Venus Project, will you?

30
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,760
They're an important client.

31
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:52,129
Sir, you just wait.
