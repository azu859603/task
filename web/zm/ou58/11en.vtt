00:00:01.169 --> 00:00:03.730
It's a slobber, don't show you.

2
00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:06.209
It's not delicious, I've never had this before.

3
00:00:06.209 --> 00:00:08.419
I didn't realise he was so poor.

4
00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:10.580
All that's so sad.

5
00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:15.060
Ella, this is the project proposal for our big kai and winners.

6
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.420
There's a meeting tomorrow at Kings Cross. Get to it.

7
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.300
A meeting tomorrow and you're only giving it to me now.

8
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:31.199
If you can't do this job, you might as well quit and get home with your brother.

9
00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.939
I'll definitely land the deal.

10
00:00:33.939 --> 00:00:49.619
Good.

11
00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:51.380
Finally done.

12
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.740
It's this. You work so hard, how much do you earn?

13
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.590
Two thousand.

14
00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.750
Two thousand a day, that's not much.

15
00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.820
Not two thousand a day, a month.

16
00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.180
You kids have no concept of money.

17
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:15.439
Look, you bought me food, so I'm going to give you this.

18
00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:20.670
So shiny. Kids toys are so realistic these days.

19
00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.670
It does look a bit old.

20
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.590
It's from 1969.

21
00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.230
1969?

22
00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.030
That explains why it looks so old.

23
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.310
Now that I'm done, do you want to go buy a toy car?

24
00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:34.750
Let's go.

25
00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:35.709
That's good.
