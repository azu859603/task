00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.379
Thank you so much. When I get my bonus, I'm going to treat you to KFC for a month.

2
00:00:05.379 --> 00:00:06.879
Great.

3
00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:10.179
Wait.

4
00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:14.099
Boss, I have secured a deal with winners. I do not let you down.

5
00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.109
Excuse me, did you just say you secured the deal?

6
00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:23.760
Of course, you have too. I'll buy your two bubble tea when we get fullness.

7
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.679
I work day and night on that project. You didn't even help.

8
00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:31.539
You even swapped my report nearly jeopardizing the deal.

9
00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:35.460
Bella, you bring your brother to work every day.

10
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:43.780
How could you do any decent work? Mr. Alistair, she's a liar and should be fired.

11
00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.409
You don't have to come into work tomorrow.

12
00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:53.409
Did you hear that? Get lost.

13
00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:59.179
It's all about you, you know. You get both company for your own personal game.

14
00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:06.319
Nephew, how could she let such a detrimental person into a company?

15
00:01:06.319 --> 00:01:11.620
You are Mr. Alistair's uncle? I'm so sorry, Mr. Alistair.

16
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:12.900
Please leave.

17
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:22.370
Applesha.

18
00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:27.060
He's my mother's youngest brother, but I think he's more fond of you now.

19
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.180
Who sits for some of this?
