00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:10.259
Enough! I've seen their work, you with your incompetence, but fired.

2
00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:16.969
But, Alistair, I wasn't spending any rumours.

3
00:00:16.969 --> 00:00:21.969
All I'm saying is that I saw the assistant goes inside Rowling's car.

4
00:00:21.969 --> 00:00:25.769
What nonsense are you talking about? Do you have any evidence?

5
00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.370
Well, you don't want people to know that don't say anything at all.

6
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:33.570
Besides, Rowling called me yesterday and he told me that.

7
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.369
Why don't you call him again?

8
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:46.740
I have. But he's just too busy.

9
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.429
Hello.

10
00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:56.840
You're James Kevin Rowling?

11
00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.460
Who says this name can't be for a woman?

12
00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:07.150
Who says a woman can't earn luxury cars and designer bucks with her own skills?

13
00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:21.689
I don't need to rely on looks to climb up. I've always been at the top.

14
00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:27.209
Alistair, I've decided to collaborate deeply with your company.

15
00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:30.430
This time, don't pay me the collaboration fee.

16
00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.629
Give it to Bella.

17
00:01:32.629 --> 00:01:34.629
How much is the fee this time?

18
00:01:34.629 --> 00:01:37.629
Not much, just $300K.
