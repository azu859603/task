00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So I think...

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I'm so sorry.

3
00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:18.539
What's going on? You're not usually this clumsy.

4
00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.539
I'm so sorry, Alice. I got kicked out of my flat this morning.

5
00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:24.539
I had to bring everything with me.

6
00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:38.189
The ex-mail has been trying to reach you for a collaboration.

7
00:00:38.189 --> 00:00:39.189
Set up a meeting.

8
00:00:39.189 --> 00:00:41.320
Don't worry about that for now.

9
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.320
Just help Bella set up in the apartment.

10
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.320
Sure, sir.

11
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:50.649
Your decorations are so beautiful.

12
00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:52.649
This is actually one of my less frequented apartments.

13
00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.780
You can stay here until you find a new flat.

14
00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.570
I'll see you.

15
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.570
Where'd you get this? I'd like to get one for my mum.

16
00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.109
It's actually from Christie's.

17
00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:09.099
Sorry.

18
00:01:09.099 --> 00:01:12.700
It's fine.
