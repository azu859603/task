Happy New Year Mum. I've been paid recently. What do you want and I'll send it to you?

2
00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:14.980
Oh it's Bella. Still remember to call home do you? I thought you'd be too ashamed after being dumped.

3
00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:24.640
Bella's not interested in getting married. She works for one of the top 500 companies in the UK.

4
00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.920
I'm focusing on my career. I'll bring you over when I'm ready.

5
00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:38.159
If you were really filial, you wouldn't have been dumped. Your mother slaved as a maid to educate you.

6
00:00:38.159 --> 00:00:49.280
And this is how you repay her. Sister, I pity you. My daughter in the UK married well, unlike yours.

7
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.000
If I was you, I'd be too ashamed to share my face. How dare you speak to Mum like that?

8
00:00:54.079 --> 00:01:08.299
My son-in-laws, the CEO of DX Mail in the UK, he's securing a big investment. We'll be on a different level then. I need to go for dinner.

9
00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:18.959
Mum, you've been wrong. I'm OK. My pride doesn't matter. She was your happy.

10
00:01:18.959 --> 00:01:24.319
OK, I'll touch you later. OK, bye darling.

11
00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:25.200
Bye.
