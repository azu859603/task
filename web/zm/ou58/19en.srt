00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:05,070
Bella, why do you drink so much?

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:11,630
Um, you smell like stinky socks, you're always burning my mum and I'm going to turn you

3
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:13,699
into dust.

4
00:00:13,699 --> 00:00:15,980
Careful, that's 50k.

5
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:19,140
I don't care, she bullied my mum.

6
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:28,579
Smash it.

7
00:00:28,579 --> 00:00:29,579
Feel better?

8
00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:32,670
Feel so useless.

9
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:40,810
You're young, when you get older you'll be strong and you'll be able to protect her.

10
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:41,810
Really?

11
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:42,979
Yes.

12
00:00:42,979 --> 00:01:30,659
Because you're the most wonderful person I've ever met.

13
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:33,579
Hello?

14
00:01:33,579 --> 00:01:37,599
Yes, about the DXML investment.

15
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:40,150
I've decided to meet with them.

16
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:43,010
No, no, no.

17
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:45,650
Tell them to come to my house.

18
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:45,689
Okay.
