1
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,400
Bella, what are you doing here?

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,900
You're not made are you?

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,660
Your mum's made.

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,660
Seems like everyone runs in the family.

5
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:13,660
What are you doing here?

6
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:17,739
Alistair invited us.

7
00:00:17,739 --> 00:00:19,739
Bella, where are you going? You're not going to serve as tea.

8
00:00:19,739 --> 00:00:24,859
You don't deserve tea made by her.

9
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:27,050
You must be Alistair.

10
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:29,050
Sorry, we didn't mean to order your maid around.

11
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:31,050
She's not my maid.

12
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:34,170
She's my woman.

13
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,170
So, she's your girlfriend.

14
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:38,170
Music cooperation deal is set then?

15
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:43,539
Actually, on second thoughts, from now on,

16
00:00:43,539 --> 00:00:46,539
I want our cooperation to end.

17
00:00:46,539 --> 00:00:53,030
Our family ties, now cease,

18
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:55,189
so I kindly ask you to leave.

19
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:56,189
Well, it's the why.

20
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:59,189
Because of your condescending attitude to Bella.

21
00:00:59,189 --> 00:01:01,189
Cousin, we're wrong.

22
00:01:01,189 --> 00:01:02,189
It's feet for us.

23
00:01:02,189 --> 00:01:04,319
Bella is kind,

24
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,310
and I won't tolerate any disrespect.

25
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:09,310
Now, get out.

26
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,920
Cousin, we're wrong.

27
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:13,920
Can we speak for us?

28
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,920
Get out.

29
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:35,599
I believe that someday you'll be a strong woman.

30
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:39,750
But for now, may I support you.
