1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:03,359
Don't please don't kill my father

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:13,460
Arnold you were my most loyal friend. This is the price you must pay for the train. Don please

3
00:00:15,019 --> 00:00:20,019
It's been my children. If you care so much about your family, let's make a contract

4
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:28,399
Your daughter Alice will keep her purity until she's 18 and then she will marry my son Gertrude

5
00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:32,619
with all your families

6
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:35,920
Will as for your son

7
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,420
We're good sir. We could no longer marry that the boss's permission

8
00:00:40,939 --> 00:00:42,780
You'll work for the gang

9
00:00:42,780 --> 00:01:01,509
Forever the plan to get in you has lasted for 15 years

10
00:01:02,149 --> 00:01:06,409
Since then that moment I've been playing the traps in my hands

11
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:35,489
My dear Augusta, I'm finally going to marry you tomorrow Pietra today. I'm gonna take your place

12
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:37,530
Are you crazy?

13
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:42,739
I know you care about me as my brother, but for Christ's sakes, you're a man

14
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:50,689
I found a loophole in the contract. Pietra has to marry a child of the Caster of family

15
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:54,459
Doesn't have to be you. I can take your place

16
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:58,040
He's a monster and a playboy

17
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,760
God knows how many mistresses

18
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:07,519
Besides how could Pietra possibly want to marry a man to protect you have to try? It's too risky

19
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:10,479
He'll kill you

20
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,080
Kill who?
