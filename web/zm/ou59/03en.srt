00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:13,230
Pietro, I love you with all my heart, I must know what kind of cunt can take my place.

2
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:19,940
Welcome to Pietro and Augusto's wedding.

3
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:22,059
My son is the bride.

4
00:00:22,059 --> 00:00:25,899
Same sex marriage in this city as an insult to the mafia.

5
00:00:25,899 --> 00:00:26,899
He's gonna marry a man.

6
00:00:26,899 --> 00:00:28,420
Then why can't I be the one?

7
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:29,420
Don't.

8
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:30,420
Do something to stop this.

9
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:31,420
Pietro.

10
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:32,420
Stop this nonsense.

11
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:37,140
Our gang will be the laughingstock of the city, our boss marrying a man and the man's

12
00:00:37,219 --> 00:00:46,600
son of a traitor.

13
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,039
No matter what happens today, we are getting married.

14
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:53,359
The contract clearly states that I will marry a Castro child.

15
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:55,679
It is legal for me to marry Augusto.

16
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:57,679
When was this contract changed?

17
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:02,560
I am still the boss and I order you to stop this ridiculous wedding.

18
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,560
That would be great.

19
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:13,890
Father, you remember what happened three days ago?
