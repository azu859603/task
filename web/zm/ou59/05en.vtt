00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.219
Let's make a deal. You have one month to take over the Viz Casino.

2
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.000
Deal. Don's been trying to get that casino back for 15 years. In one month.

3
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.259
There's still hope to stop this marriage. My family's only good at making money.

4
00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:20.879
We don't have any power over anyone in this city. My son will be ruined by the mafia.

5
00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.899
Now that the deal is made, let the wedding continue.

6
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:30.039
Here I've lost time. When I saw your mesmerizing eyes on the day of the contract,

7
00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:32.960
I was captivated by you just to get to you.

8
00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:36.359
But I knew I had to risk everything, even my life.

9
00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:42.799
In this city, within the family, men who commit sodomy are the worst of disgracees.

10
00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:51.250
Either you both die, or one of you takes the other one down with his own hands.

11
00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:53.200
You choose.

12
00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.070
Father, it's my birthday. Please don't kill them.

13
00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.149
Are you sure? Let them go.

14
00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:17.920
If I don't kill them, this city's mafia won't let them live.

15
00:01:19.019 --> 00:01:25.019
Pietro, you're not powerful enough. Kindness can make you seem a clown.

16
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.560
For the past 15 years, I've tried to live as a notorious monster

17
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.560
to become strong enough that nothing can stop me marrying you.

18
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.319
You're my darling. Kiss the girl.
