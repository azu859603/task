1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.169
I want you to use that to protect yourself.

2
00:00:04.169 --> 00:00:06.169
Don't fight for me.

3
00:00:06.169 --> 00:00:17.489
This is Augusto, my husband.

4
00:00:17.489 --> 00:00:19.489
Can you believe this ourself?

5
00:00:19.489 --> 00:00:21.649
He's bossing the biggest family.

6
00:00:21.649 --> 00:00:23.649
And locked number one,

7
00:00:23.649 --> 00:00:25.649
I am proud to present to you

8
00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:28.649
Sapphire encrusted hand cuffs.

9
00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:32.250
Opening bids?

10
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.079
One million.

11
00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:36.079
Two million.

12
00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:37.460
Four million.

13
00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:38.460
Five million.

14
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.460
What are you doing?

15
00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.460
If you want them, I'll get them for you.

16
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.460
You're just going to buy everything I like.

17
00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:44.460
Of course.

18
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.689
Ten million.

19
00:00:45.689 --> 00:00:47.689
First three million.

20
00:00:47.689 --> 00:00:48.689
Twenty million.

21
00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:50.689
Thirty.

22
00:00:50.689 --> 00:00:51.689
This is crazy.

23
00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:52.689
Some people don't have the power.

24
00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:54.689
Some people love.

25
00:00:54.689 --> 00:00:56.689
Patrick, please just leave it.

26
00:00:56.689 --> 00:01:04.060
Go.

27
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:05.060
Fifty million.

28
00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.180
Fifty million.

29
00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.269
Fifty million dollars on you, sir.

30
00:01:10.269 --> 00:01:13.689
Going once, going twice.

31
00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:15.689
Fifty million dollars.

32
00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.689
Congratulations.

33
00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:19.689
My husband, Augusto.

34
00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:20.689
Oh, my God.

35
00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:21.689
That's so sweet.

36
00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.659
It's worth everything as long as you have.

37
00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:30.659
This is the most expensive gift I've ever received.

38
00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.890
They may be a great gift for my estranged son.

39
00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.890
The Pietra is the boss of the city.

40
00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:36.890
Where's your respect?

41
00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.890
Your little bitch has got some balls.

42
00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.890
He's the boss of the bedroom as well.

43
00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.069
No one stops the one I love.

44
00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:45.069
Silly boy.

45
00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:48.170
Maybe you've had too many dicks up your house.

46
00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.170
Fuck with your brain.

47
00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:54.790
He's fucked up.

48
00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:17.740
Killing a car like that.

49
00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.740
It's going to cause a lot of trouble.

50
00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:20.740
That's done.

51
00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.960
Relax.

52
00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:28.620
I never should have shown any interest in those stupid handcuffs.

53
00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.740
I've made a mess of the whole family, haven't I?

54
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.740
What if I told you that Carl was the boss of the VISTA scene, though,

55
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.259
and killing him was all part of the mission?

56
00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:40.259
Oh, so is your plan to kill Carl all along?

57
00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:42.419
He's cute, even when he's angry.

58
00:02:42.419 --> 00:02:44.419
Yes, yes, but...

59
00:02:44.419 --> 00:02:46.740
I've got the hand pass for you.

60
00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.889
Not a part of the plan.

61
00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:52.889
So what you really want is to lock me up.

62
00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:57.479
To lock us together.

63
00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:59.479
$50 million.

64
00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:01.479
Don't you think that's a bit excessive?

65
00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:06.139
Like I said, you're worth it.

66
00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:09.240
I'm just an average, simple man.

67
00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.240
I don't deserve any of this.

68
00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.229
Listen to me, Gaston.

69
00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:16.229
You deserve everything.

70
00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:22.710
All the luxuries in the world.

71
00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:24.710
Boss, Don is here to see you.

72
00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:25.710
Yeah, one sec.

73
00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:34.719
You can uncuff me now.

74
00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:36.719
I don't like it when you smell that someone else.

75
00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:37.939
Go, Shell.

76
00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:52.539
What does it mean when someone, you know, suddenly buys you an expensive gift?

77
00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:54.539
Says it's worth anything to make you happy.

78
00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:57.539
That person must be totally smitten with you.

79
00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:58.539
Totally smitten.

80
00:03:58.539 --> 00:04:01.930
And what of it's from one man to another?

81
00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.930
You mean Pietro?

82
00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:04.930
Yeah.

83
00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.889
How did you know?

84
00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:10.889
I've always wondered why Pietro agreed to your proposal so quickly.

85
00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:14.889
Maybe he's been in love with you long before.

86
00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:22.089
She's saying that he genuinely likes me.

87
00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:27.930
How are things of the casino?

88
00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.970
The casino is completely ours.

89
00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.120
I wanted the casino.

90
00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.120
Not Carl's life.

91
00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.120
You're just making the mafia hate your marriage even more.

92
00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.120
Hatred isn't my concern.

93
00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.370
I want their fear.

94
00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:46.879
Fear for me.

95
00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:55.160
But you really are in love with this boy.

96
00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:05.350
Don't give your heart away.

97
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:06.350
It's dangerous.

98
00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:14.899
I'll get to see everything.

99
00:05:14.899 --> 00:05:17.899
Yeah, it's just a pet peeve I've got.

100
00:05:17.899 --> 00:05:20.439
Hello, mistress.

101
00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:22.730
You haven't come for a long time.

102
00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:25.050
Yeah, you're no longer needed.

103
00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.050
So you only pretend to have mistresses to get your fellow buddies off your back?

104
00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:30.079
Clever girl.

105
00:05:30.079 --> 00:05:31.079
What a shame.

106
00:05:31.079 --> 00:05:32.079
You have strong needs.

107
00:05:32.079 --> 00:05:34.079
You can always enjoy more than one person.

108
00:05:34.079 --> 00:05:35.079
I'm always available.

109
00:05:35.079 --> 00:05:39.339
Yeah, you didn't know how to please me but I'm a married man now.

110
00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:41.339
Joke's on you, Augusta.

111
00:05:41.339 --> 00:05:43.339
He has so many mistresses.

112
00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:44.339
He's also straight.

113
00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:45.339
No chance he'd like you.

114
00:05:45.339 --> 00:05:46.339
Yeah, don't mind me.

115
00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:49.339
You know, you don't have to give up all your fun just for art.

116
00:05:49.339 --> 00:05:51.339
Just for our relationship.

117
00:05:51.339 --> 00:05:56.709
Has it never occurred to you that I love you for real?

118
00:05:56.709 --> 00:05:59.540
I think, Augusta.

119
00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:02.819
Why would I marry you?

120
00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:04.040
If I didn't love you.

121
00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:11.420
Would you dress impossible?

122
00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:18.480
You've only ever been with women in the past.

123
00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.480
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to upset you.

124
00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:26.560
Maybe somehow he had interest in exploring my body.

125
00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:30.069
But for true love, impossible.

126
00:06:30.069 --> 00:06:36.019
Did you know that Sliver Hills went?

127
00:06:36.019 --> 00:06:37.139
No.

128
00:06:37.139 --> 00:06:39.139
Come on, my wolf then.

129
00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:40.139
Look, my wounds.

130
00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:43.740
This isn't very hygien, is it?

131
00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:45.420
I'm a boss.

132
00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:46.420
That's an order.

133
00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:53.279
I don't stop until I say so.

134
00:06:53.279 --> 00:07:00.060
Don't want me to see me as your boss.

135
00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:06.889
Let me be your lover.

136
00:07:06.889 --> 00:07:08.889
You know I've made peace with being your servant.

137
00:07:08.889 --> 00:07:09.889
Even your prisoner.

138
00:07:09.889 --> 00:07:14.550
I'll always look up to you and obey your orders.

139
00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:17.550
Just really struggle to see you as a lover.

140
00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:18.550
I really wish you just...

141
00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:19.550
You owe me your expectations.

142
00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:22.550
You know what my expectations truly are.

143
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:23.550
So don't play dumb.

144
00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:25.550
You bow down to me.

145
00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:26.550
You'll please me.

146
00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:29.550
You never truly want to understand what I really want.

147
00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:39.519
My mother's funeral.

148
00:07:39.519 --> 00:07:53.379
We used to do this for you.

149
00:07:53.379 --> 00:08:00.079
You did it too.

150
00:08:00.079 --> 00:08:03.079
After a funeral, I just wanted to protect you.

151
00:08:03.079 --> 00:08:06.500
And the day my father wrote up that contract,

152
00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:09.500
I saw how terrified your eyes are and it made my heart ache

153
00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:11.500
and after that all I knew,

154
00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:14.879
as I wanted to do so much more than protect you.

155
00:08:14.879 --> 00:08:19.019
Like I saw him.

156
00:08:19.019 --> 00:08:20.759
I'm in love with you.

157
00:08:20.759 --> 00:08:27.209
My father's agreed to the Black Wedding.

158
00:08:27.209 --> 00:08:29.779
Day after tomorrow,

159
00:08:29.779 --> 00:08:31.939
it was a foreign night.

160
00:08:31.939 --> 00:08:32.940
So soon.

161
00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:34.940
Well, my plan for delaying the ceremony failed,

162
00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:35.940
but I can't give up.

163
00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:36.940
I should try again.

164
00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:38.940
Then draw off the Black Wedding.

165
00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:40.940
I'll officially be part of the family.

166
00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:42.389
This is just fun for you.

167
00:08:42.389 --> 00:08:44.389
We don't have to go that far.

168
00:08:44.389 --> 00:08:49.019
I'm just curious about my body.

169
00:08:49.019 --> 00:08:51.009
I'll play along.

170
00:08:51.009 --> 00:08:53.769
I'm married.

171
00:08:53.769 --> 00:08:56.659
Take the time.

172
00:08:56.659 --> 00:09:00.700
It's all about that wedding.

173
00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:04.379
I want you to see I'm greedy.

174
00:09:04.379 --> 00:09:07.620
I want you to do your body.

175
00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:14.110
The Black Wedding is about to begin.

176
00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:17.110
No matter what happens, I'll always support you.

177
00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:19.340
I'll always be my big brother.

178
00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:23.340
Can't understand why Pietro insists on marrying Augusto.

179
00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:25.340
I've given them everything.

180
00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:26.340
Including you.

181
00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:28.340
And it's still insulting me like this.

182
00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:30.340
Isn't this all caused by your cowardice?

183
00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:32.340
Day you talk to me about that.

184
00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:33.620
Please.

185
00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:34.620
Mum passed away early.

186
00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:36.620
You have to take care of Alice.

187
00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:37.620
We're a family.

188
00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:43.379
I will not be a coward again.

189
00:09:43.379 --> 00:09:45.379
In this Black Wedding ceremony,

190
00:09:45.379 --> 00:09:47.379
you vow to be lovers.

191
00:09:47.379 --> 00:09:49.379
From the depths of your souls.

192
00:09:49.379 --> 00:09:52.379
And devote your lives to protecting each other.

193
00:09:52.379 --> 00:09:56.379
To love and to cherish to your death go as part.

194
00:09:56.379 --> 00:09:57.379
Son of a bitch.

195
00:09:57.379 --> 00:10:21.169
But I think that you should be mean.

196
00:10:21.169 --> 00:10:24.500
He's a groom, not him.

197
00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:25.500
He doesn't deserve it.

198
00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:27.500
It's always been him.

199
00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:29.500
You're nothing but a fuck to him.

200
00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:31.500
There's a few more than anything.

201
00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:33.500
We fucked for so many years.

202
00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:34.500
Stop!

203
00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:35.500
He's trying to kill my heart.

204
00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:44.820
This is a Black Wedding.

205
00:10:49.679 --> 00:10:50.679
I'm wrong by rule.

206
00:10:50.679 --> 00:10:51.679
I can't kill anyone.

207
00:10:51.679 --> 00:10:53.779
But I promise you.

208
00:10:53.779 --> 00:10:55.779
I fucking promise you.

209
00:10:55.779 --> 00:10:57.779
A punishment far worse than death.

210
00:10:57.779 --> 00:11:13.340
So Pietro, are you and Miguel?

211
00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:14.340
You really?

212
00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:15.629
You're okay?

213
00:11:15.629 --> 00:11:16.629
Yes.

214
00:11:16.629 --> 00:11:26.090
Are you sure it's up to two of you?

215
00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:27.090
No one knows what I'm going to know.

216
00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:34.570
Pietro, are you know when I proposed to you?

217
00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:37.570
I was just exploiting the contract and trying to stop you from marrying Alice.

218
00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:38.570
But you accepted.

219
00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:41.570
And you risked being hated by the entire mafia group.

220
00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:43.980
Do you truly like me?

221
00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:50.019
Why do you not believe my perceptions of love?

222
00:11:50.019 --> 00:11:53.120
Look, I've proven to you so now.

223
00:11:53.120 --> 00:12:07.210
Physically.

224
00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:08.210
It's much way it feels.

225
00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:11.210
I think that they're more wine than they help.

226
00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:18.220
It's your eyes.

227
00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:30.840
I'm scared.

228
00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:43.049
Just never done this with a guy before.

229
00:12:43.049 --> 00:12:44.049
You're like my word.

230
00:12:44.049 --> 00:12:50.299
I have this moment.

231
00:12:50.299 --> 00:12:52.259
Wait.

232
00:12:52.259 --> 00:12:54.460
Didn't these feelings just start?

233
00:12:54.460 --> 00:13:16.299
At the end of the weekend.

234
00:13:16.299 --> 00:13:18.299
Yeah, I still want to turn up.

235
00:13:18.299 --> 00:13:20.419
All I want is to go again.

236
00:13:20.419 --> 00:13:23.419
But you ain't picking your phone up.

237
00:13:23.419 --> 00:13:25.620
Why you messing my head?

238
00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:55.330
You had a great time last night, didn't you?

239
00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:56.330
Yeah.

240
00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:57.330
We really hit it off.

241
00:13:57.330 --> 00:13:58.330
How was last night?

242
00:13:58.330 --> 00:13:59.330
Are you okay?

243
00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:01.330
I know it must have been hard as a straight man.

244
00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:02.330
Yeah, it was crazy.

245
00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:04.970
I think you really liked my body.

246
00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:06.450
So...

247
00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:09.659
Never fall in love with your husband.

248
00:14:09.659 --> 00:14:15.120
I'm so confused right now.

249
00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:18.340
I think I enjoyed his body too.

250
00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:22.690
But I don't think whether between us is love.

251
00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:28.990
Why do I feel like you don't actually think you would fall for you?

252
00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:29.990
Anything wrong, boss?

253
00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:33.299
The difference between us is...

254
00:14:33.299 --> 00:14:34.460
It's huge.

255
00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:37.970
Did you tell Alice about you and I?

256
00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:38.970
Last night.

257
00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:42.059
Oh yeah, that Miguel's really all over you.

258
00:14:42.059 --> 00:14:44.220
He's just a fuck to you.

259
00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:46.220
So I'm not the first man you've been with.

260
00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:51.139
Fortunately not now.

261
00:14:51.139 --> 00:14:54.139
Do you want to know him what way he would first and only?

262
00:14:54.139 --> 00:14:56.139
You're the only person I've ever truly loved.

263
00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:06.600
Oh, I can't let him take my soul.

264
00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:08.559
No, no, no.

265
00:15:08.559 --> 00:15:15.769
Sexy guy.

266
00:15:15.769 --> 00:15:18.769
Your muscles are driving me crazy.

267
00:15:18.769 --> 00:15:19.769
One million.

268
00:15:19.769 --> 00:15:20.960
We are fun.

269
00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:21.960
Not enough.

270
00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:22.960
Fuck up.

271
00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:24.409
Ten million.

272
00:15:24.409 --> 00:15:29.700
My husband's here.

273
00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:31.700
They just offered me ten million to play.

274
00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:33.700
If you keep them money, leave them.

275
00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:34.700
We have fun.

276
00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:37.750
You've got some nerve on you.

277
00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:42.750
Mrs. Roberts found out that you were paying boys on the beach to please you.

278
00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:43.750
How come?

279
00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:45.750
Do you know my wife?

280
00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:47.549
Mrs. Roberts.

281
00:15:47.549 --> 00:15:49.549
Trading legend of the east.

282
00:15:49.549 --> 00:15:52.549
This is her exclusive card.

283
00:15:52.549 --> 00:15:54.940
I'm with friends.

284
00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:57.289
What the fuck are you?

285
00:15:57.289 --> 00:16:01.679
Hold on.

286
00:16:01.679 --> 00:16:02.679
Oh, okay.

287
00:16:02.679 --> 00:16:04.509
So I'm so glad you called me.

288
00:16:04.509 --> 00:16:05.509
What can I do?

289
00:16:05.509 --> 00:16:06.509
Oh, honey.

290
00:16:06.509 --> 00:16:07.509
Honey.

291
00:16:07.509 --> 00:16:08.509
No.

292
00:16:08.509 --> 00:16:09.509
It's just me.

293
00:16:09.509 --> 00:16:10.509
I'm with Augusta.

294
00:16:10.509 --> 00:16:11.509
We friends.

295
00:16:11.509 --> 00:16:12.509
Yeah.

296
00:16:12.509 --> 00:16:13.509
We're on the beach.

297
00:16:13.509 --> 00:16:14.509
Yeah.

298
00:16:14.509 --> 00:16:16.889
Listen.

299
00:16:16.889 --> 00:16:20.700
I'll call you in a minute.

300
00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:21.700
Okay?

301
00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:22.700
I'm sorry.

302
00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:23.700
No.

303
00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:24.700
My husband was such a bad answer.

304
00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:25.700
She's been friends for years.

305
00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:27.700
She was a visitor at school.

306
00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:30.700
We became friends when she had my opinions on the stock market.

307
00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:33.769
You're going to be as talented as your dad in the finance industry.

308
00:16:33.769 --> 00:16:34.769
Yeah.

309
00:16:34.769 --> 00:16:38.769
Well, the contract stated that I could have worked for the family for the rest of my life.

310
00:16:38.769 --> 00:16:44.720
Father, I know you were sentenced that treat to Arnold to death tomorrow.

311
00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:46.720
But I've got a better idea than killing him.

312
00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:53.070
Look, I still should never find out.

313
00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:58.070
I was the one responsible for the contract before he totally falls in love with me.

314
00:16:58.070 --> 00:17:01.480
It was a contract to pay into you.

315
00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:04.019
It changed my fate.

316
00:17:04.019 --> 00:17:05.019
And Alice's.

317
00:17:05.019 --> 00:17:08.240
I've got confidence out you.

318
00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:15.900
I enjoy it.

319
00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:16.900
I'm going to lose so far.

320
00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:18.569
Yeah.

321
00:17:18.569 --> 00:17:20.569
I can't really indulge myself this much before.

322
00:17:20.569 --> 00:17:22.569
It's the beginning.

323
00:17:22.569 --> 00:17:26.460
I'm still a bit sore from last night.

324
00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:27.460
You can switch.

325
00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:29.200
Really?

326
00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:31.289
But really well.

327
00:17:31.289 --> 00:17:40.400
I'm going to sing a great part of this one.

328
00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:47.660
You're making mine tonight in your head.

329
00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:48.660
I feel you breathing.

330
00:17:48.660 --> 00:18:05.099
Thank you for getting me all this joy.

331
00:18:05.099 --> 00:18:09.099
Don't thank you, Gustave, for giving me a taste of happiness and being the love of my life.

332
00:18:09.099 --> 00:18:25.690
Yes, I can stay in hell.

333
00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:26.690
Not doing the same!

334
00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:33.519
I just want to help you fool you in the-

335
00:18:33.519 --> 00:18:35.799
Get together!

336
00:18:35.799 --> 00:18:50.720
Be your burden.

337
00:18:50.720 --> 00:19:01.599
I've already got my body, but why do you want my good for nothing's soul?

338
00:19:01.599 --> 00:19:30.990
Can you please stop doubting me?

339
00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:37.599
Let me remind you, there are still mafia in this city that disapprove of your wedding.

340
00:19:37.599 --> 00:19:39.599
You could have been killed today.

341
00:19:39.599 --> 00:19:40.890
I know.

342
00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:43.460
And I won't get another chance.

343
00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:47.559
A weak partner will always drag Pietro down.

344
00:19:47.559 --> 00:19:49.980
It was the same with my wife.

345
00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:53.069
She was killed in an assassination.

346
00:19:53.069 --> 00:19:54.809
I know.

347
00:19:54.809 --> 00:19:57.839
As a real man, I want to protect my partner too.

348
00:19:57.839 --> 00:19:58.839
A real man.

349
00:19:58.839 --> 00:20:05.319
A soft man like you is nothing more than Pietro's little pet.

350
00:20:05.319 --> 00:20:09.910
Assassin has a chance to prove himself.

351
00:20:09.910 --> 00:20:10.910
Hasn't he?

352
00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:15.900
Well, maybe I could give him that chance.

353
00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:18.900
Get him on my Falcon approved.

354
00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:22.250
He will need to win at least three medals.

355
00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:23.250
Not.

356
00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:25.250
He doesn't have to prove anything to anyone.

357
00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:26.250
I'll do it.

358
00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:30.490
Well done, Augusta.

359
00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:31.940
Pass my tests.

360
00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:34.960
I need of my son.

361
00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:51.960
Take break.

362
00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:57.049
I promise that Don, I need to win the fight competition next month.

363
00:20:57.049 --> 00:20:58.049
I'm serious.

364
00:20:58.049 --> 00:21:01.960
What are you doing?

365
00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:03.470
Hit.

366
00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:09.089
Can you stop messing around?

367
00:21:09.089 --> 00:21:12.150
Do you think being known as the gang softy is all I deserve?

368
00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:13.150
I won't.

369
00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:29.809
I've got the sacred sauce.

370
00:21:29.809 --> 00:21:32.579
You're not going to be soft anymore.

371
00:21:32.579 --> 00:21:52.500
I hope you don't set this up.

372
00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:54.500
Now you're faithful, I should get.

373
00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:56.039
Softy.

374
00:21:56.039 --> 00:21:58.299
You always see the rest softies.

375
00:21:58.299 --> 00:21:59.740
Ready.

376
00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:11.750
I'm on Augusta.

377
00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:12.750
Quiet.

378
00:22:12.750 --> 00:23:07.420
Get up and kick me.

379
00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:09.099
Let's go.

380
00:23:09.099 --> 00:23:11.950
Hard though.

381
00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:26.200
I remember this feeling Augusta.

382
00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:27.869
You're not a softy.

383
00:23:27.869 --> 00:23:29.869
You can kick anyone down.

384
00:23:29.869 --> 00:23:55.000
Softy now.

385
00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.430
Congratulations.

386
00:23:58.430 --> 00:24:01.880
It's the first test of the Falcon approved.

387
00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:03.579
Thank you.

388
00:24:03.579 --> 00:24:05.190
I feel stronger.

389
00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:07.190
The game is just beginning.

390
00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:09.319
Get ready for your next challenge.

391
00:24:09.319 --> 00:24:14.970
I just want to touch it.

392
00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:50.500
Kiatro like this.
