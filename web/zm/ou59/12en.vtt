00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.690
You know, we're actually pretty compatible physically.

2
00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:06.530
That monster. He really fucked you up.

3
00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:08.289
Don't call him a monster.

4
00:00:08.289 --> 00:00:10.830
What's going on?

5
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.990
Nothing. The cat. It's naughty.

6
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.660
I'm home tomorrow. I've something important to announce.

7
00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.660
Did you hear that? You've got to go home tomorrow.

8
00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:31.730
Go with the Aiga. You're not my prisoner.

9
00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:37.649
This is a family meeting the Aiga.

10
00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.810
Would you mind leaving?

11
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:46.939
And we're leaving.

12
00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:48.700
We must escape the mafia's control.

13
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.539
Your friend Mark said he'd help us.

14
00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:53.020
Mark, why are you bringing Mark into this?

15
00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.539
Isn't this too hasty?

16
00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.140
This contract has insulted me for 15 years.

17
00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.020
And now that monster is ruining my son's life,

18
00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:06.530
take this any more.

19
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.859
You fucking make excuses for him.

20
00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:15.329
You fucking suck.
