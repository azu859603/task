Pietro kidnapped my uncle. I had no choice. He forced me to tell you about the loophole in that contract.

2
00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:14.320
Wait, so you're saying Pietro set this all up? He set it up so that I'd marry him instead of Alex?

3
00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:22.559
Yes. The targets always been you. He's the one who set the trap.

4
00:00:22.559 --> 00:00:26.039
No, I don't believe that. I've got to hear this from him.

5
00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.039
Wait, Augusto, there's something else.

6
00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:31.219
Let's go of him! Right now!

7
00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:33.219
Wait, calm down. Just let me, let me explain.

8
00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:39.219
Don't, okay? Look, we've had to trust each other, okay? I remember that. I hope you do too.

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:49.659
Tell me what you know! Right now!
