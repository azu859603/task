00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.649
You shouldn't piss him off.

2
00:00:02.649 --> 00:00:05.099
You've forgotten that you know there's a monster.

3
00:00:05.099 --> 00:00:07.230
He's not a monster.

4
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.230
She didn't figure something out.

5
00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:17.239
I let him go.

6
00:00:17.239 --> 00:00:20.809
But you'll never see him again.

7
00:00:20.809 --> 00:00:23.440
That's a relief.

8
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.789
But about the loophole.

9
00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:26.789
He's right.

10
00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.239
I'll let you find out so you'd replace Alice and marry me willingly.

11
00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:35.170
But Mark said there was another secret.

12
00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.170
If the secret is, I've fell in love with you a long time ago.

13
00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.320
I've always wondered you, day and night.

14
00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.509
Isn't that enough?

15
00:00:44.509 --> 00:00:45.509
You're not believing.

16
00:00:45.509 --> 00:00:48.509
Sorry I wasn't brave enough to tell you the truth.

17
00:00:48.509 --> 00:00:50.979
I don't know.

18
00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:51.979
Don't be mad.

19
00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:52.979
Why are you leaving?
