1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,459
Petra, I thought I was getting to know you.

2
00:00:03,459 --> 00:00:06,459
But now it just feels like nothing's real between us.

3
00:00:06,459 --> 00:00:07,459
You scare me.

4
00:00:09,169 --> 00:00:11,169
You wanted to protect our list. I wanted to marry you.

5
00:00:11,169 --> 00:00:14,169
The sooner you found out about the loophole, the better it would be for us.

6
00:00:14,169 --> 00:00:16,170
I thought this would benefit the both of us.

7
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:19,579
Benefit? Oh, I see.

8
00:00:19,579 --> 00:00:21,579
So you just care about the outcome.

9
00:00:21,579 --> 00:00:24,579
You don't give a damn shit about my feelings.

10
00:00:24,579 --> 00:00:27,579
Your feelings have not treated you well since we've been married.

11
00:00:28,579 --> 00:00:35,409
Calm down.

12
00:00:35,409 --> 00:00:36,409
I can make this up to you.

13
00:00:38,409 --> 00:00:40,439
You almighty Pietro.

14
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:44,950
You say that you love me, but you know nothing for real lovers.

15
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:56,649
Did you ask Mark when?

16
00:00:56,649 --> 00:00:58,649
Yeah, Dad, just forget about that.

17
00:00:58,649 --> 00:00:59,649
Why?

18
00:00:59,649 --> 00:01:02,649
You know how miserable I've been here for years.

19
00:01:02,649 --> 00:01:04,739
Now we've got a chance to escape.

20
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:06,739
Yeah, and you think Pietro's going to let that happen?

21
00:01:06,739 --> 00:01:09,739
Dad, Agasto's right. We can't make it.

22
00:01:09,739 --> 00:01:11,900
Agasto.

23
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:16,420
You've totally become that monster slave.

24
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:19,420
Shame on you, you...

25
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:20,420
Dad!

26
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,420
How dare you hit my husband?
