1
00:00:06,379 --> 00:00:10,179
Pietro, you didn't kill Arnold.

2
00:00:10,179 --> 00:00:17,719
Oh no, it was my fault.

3
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:30,879
You spare a traitor, and everyone will think you're getting weak.

4
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:33,939
You've been elected as the new leader.

5
00:00:33,939 --> 00:00:38,939
The succession ceremony is being scheduled next week by the Western Alliance.

6
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:40,329
Yeah.

7
00:00:40,329 --> 00:00:43,579
And as time these old girls has finally known their place.

8
00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:46,159
They made the right choice.

9
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:49,159
But the election was before the wedding.

10
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:54,469
Your marriage broke the rules and offended them.

11
00:00:54,469 --> 00:00:56,469
Told you I'm to blame.

12
00:00:56,469 --> 00:01:02,320
Pietro, we're family.

13
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,790
I'm going to do this with you.

14
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,790
He finally considers me family.

15
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:13,459
Augusto, I want you to come with me to the Alliance meeting next week.

16
00:01:13,459 --> 00:01:16,719
Well, but Augusto doesn't know anything in the Alliance.

17
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:20,719
He needs to see the impact your marriage has had on the family.

18
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:23,739
I can do it.

19
00:01:23,739 --> 00:01:28,939
Well done, Augusto.

20
00:01:28,939 --> 00:01:33,780
This is the second test of the Falcon at Program.
