00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:11,019
Relax. The wall is our guns.

2
00:00:11,019 --> 00:00:24,160
We've got cover outside. Welcome everyone and thank you for joining

3
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:32,500
Pietro's ceremony to become the new Alliance leader.

4
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:37,439
Good one. I'd like to introduce you to my husband

5
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:44,780
Bogosto. I know there's been some concerns about our marriage

6
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:58,210
so I come bearing gifts. One apple equals one share in the

7
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:03,920
casino's profits. You think this is going to erase the

8
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:10,750
shame of marrying a man? Each apple represents my sincerity.

9
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:19,890
I do have a counter offer. I back down. I challenge you all

10
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:25,390
and only my family will survive. You're two arrogance.

11
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:31,219
Pietro, divorce this man. We can ignore all your faults.

12
00:01:31,219 --> 00:01:34,930
I'd rather piss on all of your grays one by one.

13
00:01:34,930 --> 00:02:00,780
Fucking monster. Ally or my enemy. So does anyone have any

14
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:08,050
objection to Pietro being the new leader? I object.

15
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:14,930
I, Miguel, calls air. Object to Pietro's election as leader.
