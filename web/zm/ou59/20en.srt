1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,140
How the fuck did you escape?

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:06,139
You, you're, you're the bastard son that Karl talked about before he died!

3
00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:07,139
Yeah.

4
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:09,539
You killed my father before we met.

5
00:00:09,539 --> 00:00:12,470
And I should have killed you!

6
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:14,529
Yeah, true.

7
00:00:14,529 --> 00:00:17,679
That was my turn.

8
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:19,679
You, kill Augusto.

9
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:22,679
Or your entire family is destroyed.

10
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:24,679
You fucking died dreaming!

11
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:26,679
I loved you.

12
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:28,679
You abandoned me now.

13
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:30,679
I hate you.

14
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:32,939
You're fucking mad!

15
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:34,939
Kill this motherfucker.

16
00:00:34,939 --> 00:00:35,939
Bosses!

17
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:36,939
Stop!

18
00:00:36,939 --> 00:00:37,939
Stop!

19
00:00:37,939 --> 00:00:43,079
You will pay for this!

20
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:45,079
You'll fucking die!

21
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:51,179
An eye for an eye.

22
00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:54,750
Everyone will fight for the family today!

23
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:59,179
Fight for the family!

24
00:00:59,179 --> 00:01:00,179
Okay, true.

25
00:01:00,179 --> 00:01:03,179
At this time, let me fight with you side by side.
