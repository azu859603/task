1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,080
Farber was almost taken out last time.

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,580
I can't wish putting you in danger again, okay?

3
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:06,080
Yeah, because of our marriage.

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,080
Yeah, you don't stay. Stop a gusto from leaving the man on.

5
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:10,580
No.

6
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,460
You said you were giving me a chance.

7
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,989
I'm not a softie.

8
00:00:17,989 --> 00:00:20,059
I'm not your pet!

9
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,609
They're saving me that day.

10
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:45,280
You've been here for days now.

11
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,280
Do you still think Pietro really loves you?

12
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,679
I thought a lot.

13
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:51,679
Maybe we are never compatible.

14
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:55,289
I don't know if I can accept this kind of love.

15
00:00:55,289 --> 00:01:00,369
Good. You're a real man.

16
00:01:00,369 --> 00:01:03,509
Augusta.

17
00:01:03,509 --> 00:01:07,019
I know you're smart like your father.

18
00:01:07,019 --> 00:01:09,500
I could send you to university.

19
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,209
You could start a new life.

20
00:01:12,209 --> 00:01:16,900
I can't even take a step out the door.

21
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:19,629
I know my son best.

22
00:01:19,629 --> 00:01:23,780
He married you using a loophole.

23
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:30,219
And right now, you're the biggest loophole in his life.
