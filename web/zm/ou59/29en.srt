1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:03,660
That's weird. It's a bit unlikely I'm to give me a break.

2
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,220
Oh, fuck off mate, he's spoken for.

3
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:25,140
When was the last time we had a drink?

4
00:00:26,809 --> 00:00:27,809
I think the last time was at the beach.

5
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:36,670
When I signed that contract, I just thought uni,

6
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:40,740
summer prom, all that stuff was just over for me.

7
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:43,950
You were great at it?

8
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:44,950
Yeah, of course.

9
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:45,950
Do you hate me?

10
00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:48,979
No. No, it's not like you wrote the contract.

11
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:52,049
How about the drugs would you really hate me?

12
00:00:52,049 --> 00:00:53,049
It's my life's been forever.

13
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:58,170
I always want to give you the freedom and respect that you deserve.

14
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:01,170
And I always want to let you do what you've got to do.
