1
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:14,679
Do you know I always question when you say love or does you think I'm a monster?

2
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:19,399
We're so different. I

3
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:23,839
Don't know why I don't just call you look listen my hits

4
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:26,710
You're the light of my life

5
00:00:28,129 --> 00:00:31,730
First day I saw you I just knew since we've been married

6
00:00:32,289 --> 00:00:37,939
I've become a lot stronger, but I've seen you change too

7
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:44,579
Yeah, because love it takes patience and equality

8
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:54,579
You trust me except my love is responsible to me. Thank God. I've just time to confess everything

9
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:01,119
Just one more thing after telling me

10
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:10,680
It's how I go we do it now. I'll tell you everything when I get back
