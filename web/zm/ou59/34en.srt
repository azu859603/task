1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,919
What a heart-wrenching story.

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:05,639
Augusto, do you really think a lawyer would make such a dumb mistake?

3
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:11,130
15 years ago, it was 12-year-old Pietro who forced him to change the contract.

4
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:15,449
15 years ago, he set me up to replace the hellies.

5
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:16,690
It's more than that.

6
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:22,969
15 years later, he forced Mark to let you know about the loophole so that you would volunteer to marry him.

7
00:00:22,969 --> 00:00:26,620
I've got a story I fell in love with you 15 years ago.

8
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:31,239
I hit my sexuality for all those years and I worked my way up the ranks of the mafia

9
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:32,759
and become the most feared nimble.

10
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:33,920
Liar!

11
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,679
You wouldn't know how we had sex.

12
00:00:36,679 --> 00:00:41,869
He fucked me hard while he was watching you having sex with Anne.

13
00:00:41,869 --> 00:00:43,030
I was venting.

14
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:45,189
And that's why you're a psycho just like me.

15
00:00:45,189 --> 00:00:47,189
That's why we're the perfect match.

16
00:00:47,189 --> 00:00:50,990
You can just hold me all this after we were married.

17
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:54,710
He wouldn't dare because he has an even bigger secret.

18
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:57,780
The secret that Mark didn't finish before he left.

19
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,219
Well, good news, I found him abroad.

20
00:01:00,219 --> 00:01:02,020
You want to hear about it?

21
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:07,060
Hey girl, if you stop here, I'll let you call him.

22
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:09,370
Asshole!

23
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:12,879
You really think you could still boss me around, Augusta?

24
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:17,709
Guess why you've been called a softie and who really made the contract?

25
00:01:17,709 --> 00:01:23,829
He feared you'd get too strong and that you would rebel against him and then finally leave him.

26
00:01:23,829 --> 00:01:26,500
Is all this true?

27
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:29,319
I don't want to lie to you, right?

28
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:33,170
I was trying to protect you and I don't want to lose you.

29
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:38,609
If the target was me, Pietro, for 15 years, why did Alice have to suffer?

30
00:01:38,609 --> 00:01:40,170
So what are you waiting for?

31
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,129
This is your chance to get revenge.
