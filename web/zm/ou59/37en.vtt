1
00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:03.940
What are you doing?

2
00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:07.320
I couldn't believe what you called my bluff at the wedding.

3
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.929
And when you showed me your love, I wasn't scared enough to believe it.

4
00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:13.470
Hey!

5
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:15.470
It's not your fault.

6
00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:16.469
It is my fault.

7
00:00:16.469 --> 00:00:18.949
I was scared to tell him I love him.

8
00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:22.500
I wasn't strong enough to hold onto the man I love.

9
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.140
This is exactly what he wanted here.

10
00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.329
He really tried to gain your love.

11
00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:33.219
Get through listening.

12
00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:37.689
If you don't wake up, you're going with you.

13
00:00:37.689 --> 00:00:38.689
Be crazy.

14
00:00:38.689 --> 00:00:41.100
You just have your family.

15
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.100
Oh, don't you get it?

16
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.100
Pierre chose my family.

17
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.579
He's the family I've chosen.

18
00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:48.579
My soulmate.

19
00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:52.700
He's loved me for 15 years.

20
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.700
You're at the start of our story.

21
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.759
Nope.

22
00:00:56.759 --> 00:00:58.759
I get to write the end.
