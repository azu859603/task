1
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:09,660
Thank you for finally loving me.

2
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:33,350
Thank you everyone.

3
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:36,829
I promise to be a good leader for our alliance.

4
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:41,829
Anyone who opposes our marriage again will face the same fate as Miguel.

5
00:00:41,829 --> 00:00:46,600
Augusto, don't ask me to give you this.

6
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,600
Before he left for his retirement trip.

7
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:55,140
I'm so sorry son.

8
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,299
That contract changed everything.

9
00:00:58,299 --> 00:01:01,299
But whatever you choose, I want you to live the life.

10
00:01:01,299 --> 00:01:03,939
Are you truly right?

11
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:25,870
Augusto, as you read this, I already see you as my son.

12
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:30,030
And you've earned my last medal for passing the Falcon up program.

13
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:36,340
You're now fully qualified to stand by Pietro for the rest of your life.

14
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:41,060
I want to cancel the contract.

15
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:45,980
Believe in me.
