1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
My fiance will fire you in a hot minute.

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,200
You really expect me to believe that?

3
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:13,199
I will march right over there and prove it.

4
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:17,539
All right, all right, I'm sorry, okay?

5
00:00:17,539 --> 00:00:19,500
Time.

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,620
I'll let it slide this time, you know,

7
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:28,410
since my fiance's waiting for me.

8
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:30,769
The Greason Group CEO's fiance?

9
00:00:30,769 --> 00:00:32,969
Yeah, right, good one, Alice.

10
00:00:33,969 --> 00:00:37,149
Shit, my stomach is upset again.

11
00:00:37,149 --> 00:00:39,189
Every time I have something important.

12
00:00:39,189 --> 00:00:41,109
Alice, should I have that woman

13
00:00:41,109 --> 00:00:43,390
pretending to be your fiance removed?

14
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:46,909
No need, but I want you to find out

15
00:00:46,909 --> 00:00:49,630
the relationship between the director and the security guard.

16
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:52,310
And if it's true, fire them both.

17
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:53,149
Understood.
