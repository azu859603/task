00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:06,500
Hey

2
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,869
Why are you here? I should be asking you that

3
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:22,699
Thank you for this. No, you can keep it. I didn't think the tough girl that just chased down a thief this morning

4
00:00:22,699 --> 00:00:24,199
I said just outside to her

5
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:27,789
Hey, you're you're here for an interview, right?

6
00:00:28,309 --> 00:00:32,490
Why don't you go ahead you way in the break room, okay? Oh?

7
00:00:39,219 --> 00:00:45,850
Look and lady. Hey

8
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:52,799
He works here too. He's kind of sweet

9
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:59,979
What's your hold on please? What is she doing here? Are you still tangled up with your eyes?

10
00:00:59,979 --> 00:01:06,540
No, no, of course. I she's probably here for an interview or something. She's like, why would I be interested in her when I have you?

11
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:11,040
Baby, look at you. Yeah, that's true. It is. No one can compete with me. No

12
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:19,930
No one. Besides, I bet she doesn't even know that daddy is VP of Grace and Group. Oh VP, huh?

13
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:21,930
Don't forget.

14
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:23,930
Oh my God, seriously.

15
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:30,439
Hello, Mr. Dennis, you gotta help me. There's just someone trying to fire me. Who who's trying to fire you?

16
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:36,760
Mr. Grayson's fiancee. I accidentally offended her and I didn't even know we had a fiancee. They're trying to kick me out

17
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,280
Mr. Grayson, that's a fiance
