1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,600
Mr. Gracie and NASA PiancÃ©?

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:02,600
What?

3
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:06,599
I've been trying forever to get with him, and now some chip just waltzes in and takes

4
00:00:06,599 --> 00:00:07,599
him?

5
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:10,099
If it's Mr. Gracie's decision, I can't help you.

6
00:00:10,099 --> 00:00:11,599
All right, you're on your own, buddy.

7
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,560
That's weird?

8
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,560
Yeah, no, it's very weird.

9
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,589
Since when does he have a...

10
00:00:16,589 --> 00:00:17,589
I don't know.

11
00:00:17,589 --> 00:00:18,589
I don't know.

12
00:00:18,589 --> 00:00:19,589
We'll go find out.

13
00:00:19,589 --> 00:00:20,589
Let's go together and...

14
00:00:20,589 --> 00:00:21,589
Wait.

15
00:00:21,589 --> 00:00:27,420
Before we do that, I have to take care of someone.

16
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:28,420
I have to talk to Liam.

17
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:30,379
Tell him not to hire that bitch.

18
00:00:30,379 --> 00:00:31,379
Get with him.

19
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:32,380
Okay.

20
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:33,380
I'm with it.

21
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:34,380
Ooh.

22
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:35,380
Let's go.

23
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:36,570
Ooh, he's so evil.

24
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:37,979
Nice.

25
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:38,979
Sam, come in.

26
00:00:38,979 --> 00:00:40,979
We've dealt with the security guard.

27
00:00:40,979 --> 00:00:43,979
The director he's connected to is a new hire named Simon.

28
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:50,979
From what I understand, you got into the company through his relationship with Davis's daughter, Jennifer.

29
00:00:50,979 --> 00:00:51,979
Okay.

30
00:00:51,979 --> 00:00:54,979
Liam, for now, he's a small-time director, can't cause much trouble.

31
00:00:54,979 --> 00:00:56,979
I want you to bring in the girl from the break room.

32
00:00:56,979 --> 00:00:57,979
I'm sorry.

33
00:00:57,979 --> 00:00:59,979
Remember the girl that was bragging at the entrance?

34
00:00:59,979 --> 00:01:00,979
I want you to bring her in.

35
00:01:00,979 --> 00:01:02,979
I want you to tell HR that I want to make him my secretary.
