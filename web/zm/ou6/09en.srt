00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:12,009
Hi, Mr. Grace. Oh, you again. What are you doing here?

2
00:00:12,009 --> 00:00:14,199
Why shouldn't I be here?

3
00:00:14,199 --> 00:00:16,199
Is he Mr. Grayson's assistant?

4
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:22,100
Oh, hey, you forgot these this morning.

5
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:27,379
Oh, thank God. He's always costing like a month's rent.

6
00:00:27,379 --> 00:00:36,810
Hey, you're hired. Starting today. CEOs, secretary.

7
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:40,810
Seriously? I haven't even interviewed Mr. Grayson. Oh, my God.

8
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:49,729
Hey, I like what you're saying, huh?

9
00:00:49,729 --> 00:00:54,670
No, what? Don't?

10
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:57,670
Maybe he feels like a thing.
