1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,259
What the hell is going on here?

2
00:00:03,259 --> 00:00:09,039
Could I land Simon so now you're after Mr. Grayson?

3
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:10,039
What?

4
00:00:10,039 --> 00:00:11,039
He's Mr. Grayson?

5
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:12,039
Liam.

6
00:00:12,039 --> 00:00:13,039
Don't let this woman fool you.

7
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:15,039
He's Mr. Grayson at work.

8
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:16,039
Mr. Grayson!

9
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:18,039
Don't let this woman fool you!

10
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:19,039
I mean, you can see what she's trying to do.

11
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:20,039
Clearly she's trying to seduce you.

12
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:23,039
Since when do I need your approval for hiring decisions?

13
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:24,420
Hey, I'm Alice.

14
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,420
The CEO's new secretary?

15
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:28,519
The CEO's secretary?

16
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:30,870
A slut like you?

17
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:33,130
Hey, enough!

18
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:35,539
Your dad may be a shareholder, but you're not.

19
00:00:35,539 --> 00:00:37,539
Stay out of the CEO's office.

20
00:00:37,539 --> 00:00:40,539
You'll pay for this, bitch.

21
00:00:40,539 --> 00:00:45,270
Thank you for the save, Mr. Grayson.

22
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,270
I'll go check in with HR.

23
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:49,270
Ooh, not so fast.

24
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:52,100
It's not that simple.

25
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,100
What do you mean?

26
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,159
Today's the day your dreams come true.

27
00:00:57,159 --> 00:01:01,700
I am going to officially make you my fiance.
