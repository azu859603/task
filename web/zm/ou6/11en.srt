1
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:04,169
That bitch, Alice. How dare she seduce Liam?

2
00:00:04,169 --> 00:00:06,589
What? Liam, Arab, the Grayson group?

3
00:00:06,589 --> 00:00:08,890
I saw it with my own eyes.

4
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:10,550
Could she be the so-called fiance?

5
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:11,990
Yes, impossible.

6
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:14,830
Liam's mother has ridiculously high standards.

7
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:16,789
Count with socialites and nobles

8
00:00:16,789 --> 00:00:18,329
didn't make the cuphouse short.

9
00:00:18,329 --> 00:00:19,730
Possibly!

10
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:21,329
It's time to chance her.

11
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:24,800
I need to call Miss Grayson.

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,530
I am going to officially make you my fiance.

13
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:30,690
What?

14
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,990
Beyonce? No, no way. I don't even know you.

15
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:35,130
You know, I thought this is what you wanted.

16
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:37,829
Wait, did he overhear me bragging with security?

17
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:43,200
I'm... I'm sorry, Mr. Grayson. I can't.

18
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,109
Well, yeah, okay. Um...

19
00:00:47,109 --> 00:00:48,770
Listen, what if I told you, right?

20
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:52,530
I told you this is the only way you're going to get the job.

21
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:57,579
Then I would say that I can't work here.

22
00:00:57,579 --> 00:01:10,819
You can go.

23
00:01:10,819 --> 00:01:12,379
Did you change your mind already?

24
00:01:12,379 --> 00:01:14,120
Did you change your mind already?

25
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,319
Uh, no. I, um...

26
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:20,049
I actually accidentally got some lipstick on you earlier.

27
00:01:20,049 --> 00:01:24,480
Any shirt?

28
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,650
It's, um...

29
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:29,049
Hey, uh, could you give me a new shirt, please, now?

30
00:01:29,049 --> 00:01:30,450
Oh, no, actually.

31
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:32,700
Honestly, it's my fault. Just...

32
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,840
Let me buy you a new shirt, Mr. Grayson.

33
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,439
Okay. Uh...

34
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:38,480
Yeah, fine. Um, you know what?

35
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,469
You go to, um...

36
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:46,319
James and Jackson on the next block.

37
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:47,620
I'm awesome.

38
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:50,459
You've always had custom tailored shirts and suits?

39
00:01:50,459 --> 00:01:52,560
What if James and Jackson doesn't fit?

40
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:53,920
Yeah, come on. You know what it says?

41
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,159
It's this low price, average quality,

42
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,659
but then, come on, it's got decent style.

43
00:01:58,659 --> 00:02:00,760
It might be cheap for you, sir,

44
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:06,700
but, uh, it might be a lot for ours.

45
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,199
Tim.

46
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,629
Thank you.

47
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:14,469
That's why I'm going to take care of so much about that girl.

48
00:02:14,469 --> 00:02:20,289
You know what you see, huh?

49
00:02:20,289 --> 00:02:21,229
What do you mean?

50
00:02:21,229 --> 00:02:24,830
I'm going to officially make you my fiance.

51
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:26,860
Snap out of it, though.

52
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:29,139
Where is James and Jackson?

53
00:02:29,139 --> 00:02:30,800
Ken, no worries.

54
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,740
I'll just ask Liam to explain this whole fiance.

55
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:36,780
Watch out!

56
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:40,439
Ah! Are you okay?

57
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:45,150
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

58
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,490
I did this.

59
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:49,319
I'm sorry, ma'am. I didn't see.

60
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:52,159
Thank you, sweetie. You have quick reflexes.

61
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:54,460
No worries. Are you sure you're not hurt?

62
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,939
Yeah, I'm good.

63
00:02:56,939 --> 00:02:58,699
What's your name, sweetheart?

64
00:02:58,699 --> 00:03:01,469
Oh, I'm Malice, but I'm sorry, ma'am.

65
00:03:01,469 --> 00:03:02,969
I have to get back to work.

66
00:03:02,969 --> 00:03:05,229
Take care.

67
00:03:05,229 --> 00:03:09,580
So she works at the company, Alice.

68
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:19,349
She'd make a fine daughter-in-law.

69
00:03:19,349 --> 00:03:21,099
Then begin.

70
00:03:21,099 --> 00:03:23,300
What are the chances?

71
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,400
Excuse me.

72
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,539
Do you have a shirt for a man who's about 6'4?

73
00:03:27,539 --> 00:03:28,539
We might have one that fits.

74
00:03:28,539 --> 00:03:30,419
Please wait a moment.

75
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:33,319
Well, if it isn't your ex, since when

76
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:36,699
can she afford to shop at a place like this?

77
00:03:36,699 --> 00:03:38,460
Hey, Alice.

78
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:42,750
We heard that you are trying to seduce the CEO.

79
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,979
Dream on, Mr. Grayson already has a fiance.

80
00:03:44,979 --> 00:03:45,819
Really?

81
00:03:45,819 --> 00:03:46,639
Yeah.

82
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:47,819
Do you know who she is?

83
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:50,379
Definitely not some bottom feeder like you.

84
00:03:50,379 --> 00:03:52,939
You're way below the Grayson family standards.

85
00:03:52,939 --> 00:03:54,539
Ma'am, your shirt is ready.

86
00:03:54,539 --> 00:03:56,479
That'll be $18,000.

87
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:59,439
$18,000 for a shirt?

88
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,520
Mr. Grayson didn't give you his car.

89
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,069
Oh, that's so sad.

90
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:09,270
Even if you try to buy his paper, you don't have the cash.

91
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:13,150
If you beg me, I might consider paying for it.

92
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:16,509
After all, $18,000 is just pocket change for me.

93
00:04:16,509 --> 00:04:19,439
Why not make your investment worth it?

94
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:23,639
Like, you know, Alice can trade with you and go to tonight's

95
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:25,519
banquet with Mr. Hodges.

96
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:28,279
You've not been feeling well, if I recall.

97
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:30,519
Do you ever, you've been feeling ill?

98
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:33,600
Did Simon give you one of his nasty diseases?

99
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,680
What?

100
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,680
You know, some of those can be incurable.

101
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,259
All you can do is get to die.

102
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:41,060
No, that's not true.

103
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,100
All that talk won't get you that shirt.

104
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,420
If you can't afford it, just get lost.

105
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:48,660
Liam doesn't want a streetman like you.

106
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,829
Is that so?

107
00:04:50,829 --> 00:04:52,470
Is that so?

108
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:53,110
Is that so?

109
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:54,269
Because I wasn't aware that I didn't

110
00:04:54,269 --> 00:04:58,000
care about my own fiance.

111
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,600
Oh, wait.

112
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,519
I don't want to tell them the fiance?

113
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:03,519
Mr. Grayson, you must be joking.

114
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:05,399
Did anyone ask for your opinion?

115
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:06,720
Shut up.

116
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,699
Hey, baby, I forgot your card.

117
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:13,899
Be my fiance to help take the pressure away from getting

118
00:05:13,899 --> 00:05:15,699
married from my family, and I will

119
00:05:15,699 --> 00:05:18,300
give you a job as my secretary.

120
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:22,720
And this, which can give you anything that you want,

121
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,120
including all this respect.

122
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,120
I guess you're right.

123
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,680
Oh, babe, you're right.

124
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,360
I was in such a hurry I must have forgot it.

125
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,680
That is a limited edition black card.

126
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,279
He really gave it to you.

127
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:39,819
I'll leave you and your lady to your shopping.

128
00:05:39,819 --> 00:05:41,339
Simon, let's go.

129
00:05:41,339 --> 00:05:45,350
Oh, hey, who says you can go?

130
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:48,589
Did you just try to pimp out my fiance to some shabby banquet?

131
00:05:48,589 --> 00:05:51,230
No, no, no, Mr. Grayson, I'm so sorry.

132
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:52,430
I offended your fiance.

133
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:52,990
I'm so sorry.

134
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:53,870
Are you apologizing to me?

135
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:57,569
Are you apologizing to Alice?

136
00:05:57,569 --> 00:05:59,850
Alice, I am so sorry.

137
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:00,889
Oh, wait.

138
00:06:00,889 --> 00:06:02,290
But what was that I couldn't hear you?

139
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:03,370
Alice, I was wrong, and I'm sorry.

140
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:05,290
All right, that's it.

141
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:07,050
He apologized.

142
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:07,810
Can we go now?

143
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:09,160
Yes.

144
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,360
Sir, you packaged the suit you came in with

145
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,439
for the one you're wearing.

146
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:13,959
Sir, cash your card?

147
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:20,939
Oh, Jennifer, did you pay for the suit that I'm wearing right

148
00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:21,860
now?

149
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,569
Oh, my God.

150
00:06:23,569 --> 00:06:25,129
What gold user?

151
00:06:25,129 --> 00:06:31,769
Is that a no?

152
00:06:31,769 --> 00:06:33,050
The card from the car.

153
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:34,209
Whoa, wait.

154
00:06:34,209 --> 00:06:34,970
Where are you going?

155
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:35,649
You can't leave.

156
00:06:35,649 --> 00:06:37,529
You haven't paid.

157
00:06:37,529 --> 00:06:41,009
Well, I just got a great idea.

158
00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:43,209
Why don't I buy the suit?

159
00:06:43,209 --> 00:06:46,110
You can put it on my card.

160
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,600
Take it off.

161
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,470
The full suit.

162
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:51,750
Alice, we were so close.

163
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,920
Close?

164
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,459
Why don't you say?

165
00:06:56,459 --> 00:07:00,459
I'm engaged now.

166
00:07:00,459 --> 00:07:02,459
Simon, don't take it off.

167
00:07:02,459 --> 00:07:04,740
I'm going to have to call the police.

168
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:05,540
Yeah, OK, OK.

169
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,920
Here's the suit you wanted to miss.

170
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,420
Thank you.

171
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,740
Hey, Simon, come by the office later.

172
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,009
OK.

173
00:07:28,009 --> 00:07:29,529
Process your resignation.

174
00:07:29,529 --> 00:07:40,290
And why don't you bring that security guard buddy to yours?

175
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:48,240
Alice, you won't get away with this.

176
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,519
Thank you for today.

177
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:52,279
And you can take Simon's suit out of my paycheck.

178
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:53,040
I don't need it.

179
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,680
Now that we made the deal, black eyes yours.

180
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,040
I can't spend your money like that.

181
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,519
So you just want to blow your own money on a suit?

182
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:02,319
Your ex-boyfriend is worn?

183
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,439
That's not what I meant.

184
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:05,519
OK.

185
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:10,750
Listen, as my fiancee, there's one more rule you must follow.

186
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,389
No inappropriate relationships with other men

187
00:08:13,389 --> 00:08:16,339
before our agreement ends.

188
00:08:16,339 --> 00:08:19,399
And you don't have to wear high heels to work anymore

189
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:34,570
because I'm going to miss a shoe anyway.

190
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:48,500
These are beautiful.

191
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,240
They look good.

192
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:58,259
Thank you for everything.

193
00:08:58,259 --> 00:09:00,580
Hey, Mom, what are you doing here?

194
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,600
Hey, Mom, what are you doing here?

195
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,240
If I hadn't come, how would I know

196
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,159
that you suddenly have a fiancee?

197
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:08,399
Well, listen, now that I'm engaged, please,

198
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,960
can you just stop with all the matchmaking?

199
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:14,120
Honey, I know you hate the idea of marrying for status.

200
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,480
But I have found a really wonderful girl this time.

201
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:21,759
She's beautiful and kind and she even saved my life.

202
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:23,919
Hey, I made up my mind, OK?

203
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:26,200
I'm not marrying anyone else but my fiancee.

204
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,679
Nonsense.

205
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:30,799
The Grayson family cannot have some random girl

206
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:32,990
as a daughter-in-law.

207
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:36,759
Mom, she's not just some random girl.

208
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:39,980
She's all so beautiful and she is kind.

209
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,940
And if you'd like to meet her, I can arrange it.

210
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:45,220
Hey, Tim.

211
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:47,740
But I want you to meet the girl that I picked out too.

212
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:48,659
Yes, boss.

213
00:09:48,659 --> 00:09:51,019
Bring Alice here.

214
00:09:51,019 --> 00:09:54,460
Wait, are you both talking about the same Alice?

215
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,220
Mr. Grayson, do you have a secie?

216
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,419
It's you.

217
00:09:57,419 --> 00:09:59,330
I'd like to see you again.

218
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:00,409
So you know each other?

219
00:10:00,409 --> 00:10:03,169
Yes, this is the girl I want to set you up with.

220
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:06,049
OK, so do you approve of her as my fiancee now?

221
00:10:06,049 --> 00:10:08,529
Approve, of course.

222
00:10:08,529 --> 00:10:11,149
But I have one condition.

223
00:10:11,149 --> 00:10:12,789
You must register your marriage.

224
00:10:12,789 --> 00:10:13,389
Two day.

225
00:10:13,389 --> 00:10:15,029
You must register your marriage.

226
00:10:15,029 --> 00:10:15,710
Two day.

227
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:16,799
What?

228
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:24,139
It looks like me.

229
00:10:24,139 --> 00:10:25,019
You know, we got no choice.

230
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:25,779
We got to get married.

231
00:10:25,779 --> 00:10:26,860
It's a little part of the plan.

232
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:30,059
Hey, listen, you know, we'll just, we'll, we'll, um,

233
00:10:30,059 --> 00:10:31,220
hey, I'll give you more money.

234
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:37,240
I didn't even thought I'm not being married yet.

235
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,899
Hi, Mom.

236
00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:40,860
Your sister's getting worse.

237
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,820
Didn't you say that you got into that pharmaceutical company?

238
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,299
Can you get the medicine early?

239
00:10:45,299 --> 00:10:45,820
Don't worry.

240
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:50,159
I'll figure something out and be at the hospital soon.

241
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:51,460
OK.

242
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,159
I'll marry you.

243
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:54,600
Can you get me some of the new drug

244
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,159
the company's been producing?

245
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:57,720
Yes, the one for the nervous system?

246
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,080
Of course, I'll see what I can do.

247
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,720
And when can we get divorced?

248
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,960
Let's figure that out later, OK?

249
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:06,200
Let's just, you know, let's just get through this crisis first.

250
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,080
I've already made an appointment for you too.

251
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,360
Go get married now.

252
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,320
Alice, come have a dinner with us tonight.

253
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,399
I want to introduce you to everyone.

254
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:17,039
Sorry, ma'am.

255
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:20,559
I have some things to take care of.

256
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:23,750
You young people are always so busy.

257
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:24,710
Fine.

258
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:26,230
But you must come next time.

259
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:27,070
Of course.

260
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:28,149
OK.

261
00:11:28,149 --> 00:11:29,029
All right.

262
00:11:29,029 --> 00:11:31,190
I won't bother you too anymore.

263
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:35,320
I'm leaving now.

264
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,679
Can we get the medicine now?

265
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:42,850
It's definitely here.

266
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:44,289
Your sister's going to be OK, right?

267
00:11:44,289 --> 00:11:45,840
Don't worry, Mom.

268
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,919
I have the medicine.

269
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:48,779
Hi, Ms. Black.

270
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:50,200
I'm leaving.

271
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,480
I'm going to make sure someone delivers

272
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,919
her daughter's medicine regularly from now on, OK?

273
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:56,679
Alice, how is this?

274
00:11:56,679 --> 00:11:58,480
Oh, Mom, this is my boss.

275
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,210
And she's the one that got us the medicine.

276
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:02,929
You're such a good person.

277
00:12:02,929 --> 00:12:05,850
Oh, I heard that this medicine was so hard to get even,

278
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:10,389
even for someone who has money.

279
00:12:10,389 --> 00:12:14,750
Actually, Alice and I are officially working together.

280
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,909
I will definitely be able to afford

281
00:12:16,909 --> 00:12:19,529
Betty's medicine from now on.

282
00:12:19,529 --> 00:12:21,649
Mom will you excuse us, Liam and I need to discuss

283
00:12:21,649 --> 00:12:23,330
some work matters.

284
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:30,889
OK?

285
00:12:30,889 --> 00:12:35,250
Hey, am I so embarrassing to you?

286
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:35,970
It's not that.

287
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:39,639
It's just our relationship is an agreement

288
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:41,440
that will eventually end in divorce.

289
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,850
And I don't want to get my mom's help up for nothing.

290
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:47,570
Fine.

291
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:49,340
Yeah.

292
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:52,149
I remember what you just said.

293
00:12:52,149 --> 00:12:54,429
This is an agreement between both of us and nothing more.

294
00:12:54,429 --> 00:13:06,039
So don't get attached.

295
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:08,720
It is absolutely unheard of for anyone

296
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,320
to get this medication.

297
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,440
If you keep it up, there's hope your daughter

298
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,399
could make a full recovery.

299
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,120
Thank you, Dr. Brown.

300
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,519
Don't thank me.

301
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:36,639
I think I'll ever provide it this.

302
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,759
Mr. Grayson, thank you for arranging the VIP room

303
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:41,120
for my sister.

304
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,559
I'm sorry about what I said earlier.

305
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:45,059
It's OK, look, I don't even think it.

306
00:13:45,059 --> 00:13:48,230
OK, but this, you know, comes to the price.

307
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:49,950
They've been around for me tonight.

308
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:51,429
Is something wrong at home?

309
00:13:51,429 --> 00:13:52,389
Mom left me a message.

310
00:13:52,389 --> 00:13:54,750
She said that Jennifer told my grandfather

311
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:55,789
about our marriage.

312
00:13:55,789 --> 00:13:58,679
So he's angry.

313
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:01,029
Just, you know, come for the dinner tonight.

314
00:14:01,029 --> 00:14:01,710
OK.

315
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:07,330
Yeah, I'll try my best to help.

316
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:10,129
Dad, this is Liam's wife.

317
00:14:10,129 --> 00:14:12,669
Good evening, Mr. Grayson.

318
00:14:12,669 --> 00:14:15,809
Nice to see you again, Alice.

319
00:14:15,809 --> 00:14:18,009
Nice to see you again, Alice.

320
00:14:18,009 --> 00:14:19,490
Jennifer, what are you doing here?

321
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:22,580
Is that how you speak to a valued guest?

322
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:24,220
If it were for Jennifer here, we wouldn't even

323
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:26,960
know about your secret marriage.

324
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,879
Of course, Jennifer came to title.

325
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:31,080
All right, enough chit chat.

326
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,039
Dinner's ready.

327
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:33,720
Alice, come on.

328
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:37,529
Let's go.

329
00:14:37,529 --> 00:14:40,529
Liam, how long have you two known each other?

330
00:14:40,529 --> 00:14:43,889
I've, what, two, three hours?

331
00:14:43,889 --> 00:14:46,610
He means we got married two or three hours ago,

332
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:49,210
but we've actually known each other for years.

333
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:51,370
Yet you only introduced me to your wife

334
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:54,370
after you're married.

335
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:56,210
You clearly have no respect for me.

336
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:57,529
Oh, no, it's not like that.

337
00:14:57,529 --> 00:15:00,129
Liam's just been so swamped with work.

338
00:15:00,129 --> 00:15:01,610
Did I ask you?

339
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:02,809
Typical.

340
00:15:02,809 --> 00:15:05,490
Just what you'd expect from a woman with no class.

341
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:08,370
No, Ms. Cox, is stealing someone's boyfriend

342
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:10,169
how you show class?

343
00:15:10,169 --> 00:15:11,409
How dare you speak to my life?

344
00:15:11,409 --> 00:15:12,169
How dare I?

345
00:15:12,169 --> 00:15:13,850
Are you Liam's wife or am I?

346
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,240
Enough.

347
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,039
No bickering in our thing.

348
00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:19,600
Grandpa, say no more.

349
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,759
I hear that Alice is your current secretary.

350
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:26,120
Starting tomorrow, Jennifer will take over that room.

351
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:29,600
Mr. Grayson, I don't think that arrangement is appropriate.

352
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,149
How dare you?

353
00:15:31,149 --> 00:15:33,350
You have no right to meddle here.

354
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:35,980
Dad, don't be so hasty.

355
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,899
Let's hear Alice out.

356
00:15:37,899 --> 00:15:42,259
I just mean that for a company as big as the Grayson group,

357
00:15:42,259 --> 00:15:44,179
hiring is a rigorous process.

358
00:15:44,179 --> 00:15:45,860
You can't just hand a key position,

359
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:49,259
like the CEO secretary to anyone.

360
00:15:49,259 --> 00:15:51,740
I'm sure I can handle the job, thank you.

361
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:55,259
OK, well, why don't we put that to the test?

362
00:15:55,259 --> 00:15:57,299
I can go over some of my qualifications.

363
00:15:57,299 --> 00:15:58,740
I graduated from Harvard Business School.

364
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:01,620
I won the BCN Global Finals, and I could speak five languages.

365
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:04,259
Chinese, French, Japanese, Spanish, and of course English.

366
00:16:04,259 --> 00:16:05,940
What are some of your qualifications?

367
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:14,120
I believe the company values ability more than a...

368
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:18,700
OK, well, let's put some of those abilities to the test as well.

369
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:22,919
Honey, could you hand me that document?

370
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:26,440
See, our company's top client is a Chinese firm.

371
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,600
If you could translate this Chinese document,

372
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:35,799
we'll consider you qualified for the job.

373
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:37,879
What is all this?

374
00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:40,509
Didn't you understand it, Ms. Con?

375
00:16:40,509 --> 00:16:44,549
Mr. Grayson, this woman is deliberately making things

376
00:16:44,549 --> 00:16:48,110
difficult, OK, to try and embarrass me?

377
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:52,190
Ms. Cox, is this how you plan on negotiating with future clients?

378
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:53,809
By whining?

379
00:16:53,809 --> 00:16:57,159
Here, let me teach you a Chinese proverb.

380
00:16:57,159 --> 00:17:01,399
Mayo, jin ganzuan, bia, lan, tichu, or, which means,

381
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:04,519
if you're not qualified, don't come for my job, rookie.

382
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:06,240
Did she just call me a whore?

383
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,720
Jennifer, enough.

384
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:11,519
I think you'd better focus on your current job.

385
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:12,359
Oh, that was delicious.

386
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:13,200
I'm done, bye.

387
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:21,730
That was impressive.

388
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:24,849
I did not expect it to be so eloquent.

389
00:17:24,849 --> 00:17:27,769
There's a lot you don't know about me, Mr. Grayson.

390
00:17:27,769 --> 00:17:30,049
Alice, it's getting late.

391
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:35,250
Why don't you two just stay here for the night?

392
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,740
Sure.

393
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,299
What am I supposed to do now?

394
00:17:38,299 --> 00:17:50,460
Are we going to sleep together?

395
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,900
Was that on purpose?

396
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,339
Because you're not wearing any heels this time.

397
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:56,460
No, it was an accident.

398
00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:04,480
Oh, really?

399
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,480
Could you open the door for me, please?

400
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:15,220
I'll need tea for you too.

401
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,059
Drink it before you rest.

402
00:18:17,059 --> 00:18:18,339
Thanks, Ma, I'll take it.

403
00:18:18,339 --> 00:18:20,640
Well, I forget myself.

404
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:36,230
So I want to see you drink it before I leave.

405
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:37,190
Thank you, Mako.

406
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:38,630
All right, I'll eat you guys.

407
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:39,630
Good night.

408
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:43,380
Good night.

409
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:48,119
Oh, sleep on the chair.

410
00:18:48,119 --> 00:19:05,160
I'll be holding my grandchild soon.

411
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,119
Why am I so dizzy?

412
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:09,559
Feels like I've lost control of my body and mind.

413
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:30,559
Hey, what are you doing?

414
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:31,880
I can't control myself.

415
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:38,369
Where are you going?

416
00:19:38,369 --> 00:19:47,500
I can sleep somewhere else.

417
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,539
Why is this locked?

418
00:19:48,539 --> 00:19:49,819
Why is this locked?

419
00:19:49,819 --> 00:19:53,799
Now it must have been my mom.

420
00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:58,640
We're married now.

421
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,430
What are you so afraid of?

422
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:07,009
But it's just a big marriage, though, right?

423
00:20:07,009 --> 00:20:10,859
It'll eventually end in the divorce.

424
00:20:10,859 --> 00:20:16,079
I'm interested in you anyway.

425
00:20:16,079 --> 00:21:24,480
I'm going to take a shower.

426
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,559
It's you.

427
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:29,559
You want to meet the first move last night?

428
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:30,640
OK, I'm sorry.

429
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,539
I almost forgot.

430
00:21:34,539 --> 00:21:39,549
It's OK.

431
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:40,829
What?

432
00:21:40,829 --> 00:21:45,410
Make it up to you?

433
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:47,890
Don't you want to come on to me last night?

434
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:48,890
Right.

435
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:53,430
Shouldn't you take responsibility for what you do?

436
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:54,910
OK.

437
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:59,220
What do you want me to do?

438
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:05,259
You should have mentioned divorce anyway.

439
00:22:05,259 --> 00:22:32,200
I get ready for work.

440
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,920
Tim, are you incredible?

441
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,640
I appreciate you.

442
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,640
Thank you.

443
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,359
I'm going to grab a coffee.

444
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:37,279
Do you want anything?

445
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:38,519
Watch out, Tungo.

446
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:38,960
I don't mind.

447
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,920
I can get it myself.

448
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,599
I'll see you at the opposite.

449
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:47,910
OK.

450
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:49,829
You ruined my life.

451
00:22:49,829 --> 00:22:51,349
You're not going to get away with it.

452
00:22:51,349 --> 00:23:03,799
You want to make sure we solidify these contracts

453
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,160
the night when you get it done, OK?

454
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,599
Lee, I wanted to apologize for what happened yesterday.

455
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:08,880
Jennifer, you're disrupting my work.

456
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,720
Please leave.

457
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,000
I won't bother you and Alice anymore, OK?

458
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:18,369
I promise.

459
00:23:18,369 --> 00:23:19,009
But it's it.

460
00:23:19,009 --> 00:23:23,000
Answer it on speaker.

461
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,490
Answer it.

462
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:26,210
Jennifer, I've got Alice.

463
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:27,970
I'm going to strip her naked and live stream.

464
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:30,210
It's ruined her reputation.
