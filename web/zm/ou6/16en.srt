00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
Sir, I've brought the fever reducer and water you asked for.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,000
Yeah, thank you, Tim.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,250
Hey, buddy.

4
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:13,820
Where are we?

5
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,519
Well, this is my mansion.

6
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,019
Look, you can stay here tonight, okay?

7
00:00:17,019 --> 00:00:18,519
No one's gonna bother you,

8
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:21,100
but you gotta promise to take a medicine.

9
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,820
Do I have to?

10
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,120
Now this.

11
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,460
Come on.

12
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:28,719
You got a fever, can't you tell?

13
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:39,960
Looks like I'm gonna have to give a team myself.

14
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,159
Big news.

15
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:44,759
We're now competing with HDS pharmaceuticals for their supplier.

16
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:47,759
Apparently, they let this receptionist handle this case.

17
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:48,759
What?

18
00:00:48,759 --> 00:00:51,259
How would a secretary know anything about this stuff?

19
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:53,759
I bet she's sleeping with one of those shareholders.

20
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:56,420
What?
