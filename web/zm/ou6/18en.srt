1
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,099
Where's Liam?

2
00:00:05,099 --> 00:00:08,699
This meeting is about our strategy against HDS Pharmaceuticals.

3
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:10,939
Is he fawning us off with the secretary?

4
00:00:10,939 --> 00:00:13,699
Mr. Grayson is an important meeting with potential partner.

5
00:00:13,699 --> 00:00:15,369
He'll be with us shortly.

6
00:00:15,369 --> 00:00:19,269
You bitch!

7
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:21,989
You leaked company secrets.

8
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:23,789
Jennifer, we're in a meeting right now

9
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:25,149
that you weren't invited to.

10
00:00:25,149 --> 00:00:29,500
So please leave and don't make accusations without proof.

11
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:35,939
You said I don't have proof.

12
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:39,579
HDS Pharmaceuticals just announced their new partnership.

13
00:00:39,579 --> 00:00:42,899
With the supplier, we now used to proof form.

14
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:44,460
How's this possible?

15
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:45,500
We felt a bit in there?

16
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,859
Who did the proposal?

17
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:48,340
This new secretary did.

18
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:52,579
She even colluded with HDS and leaked the purchase proposal.

19
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:54,979
Take a look at her emailing your secret or something.

20
00:00:54,979 --> 00:00:57,509
Jennifer, is this true?

21
00:00:57,509 --> 00:00:59,659
Yes, it is.
