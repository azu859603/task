00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.199
Wait, you admit it?

2
00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:02.040
Yup.

3
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.919
I wrote the purchase proposal last night

4
00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:06.240
and sent it to HDS, not myself.

5
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.440
How shameless.

6
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.890
You lost our most important supplier.

7
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:13.019
Ooh, Liam.

8
00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.380
Liam, unfortunately we caught Alice

9
00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:16.859
making confidential copies.

10
00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.980
Oh, you mean the proposal she sent to HDS?

11
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.940
Yes, wait, what, you know about that?

12
00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.579
Liam, we must fire the secretary.

13
00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:25.420
Before we discuss that,

14
00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.899
I have a very important announcement to make.

15
00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:30.179
I would like to officially introduce you.

16
00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:32.299
Brad Wade.

17
00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:37.320
Hello, everyone.

18
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.359
I'm Brad, CEO of HDS Pharmaceuticals,

19
00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:41.240
and your new partner.

20
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.280
Mr. Wieb, is it weird?

21
00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.119
Thank you, Alice.

22
00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.960
Wait, what?

23
00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.719
I am sorry for the late announcement,

24
00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.640
but we have officially acquired HDS pharmaceuticals

25
00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:49.640
a few days ago.

26
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.560
So the bidding was part of the plan?

27
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.950
Exactly.

28
00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:53.950
Thanks to Alice.

29
00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:54.789
You know, if it wasn't for her,

30
00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:56.789
we wouldn't have got the supplies at the lowest price.

31
00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.909
So the proposal's meant to go to HDS all.

32
00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:00.909
No, no, okay, she didn't do it.

33
00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:01.750
She did not send it out.

34
00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:02.590
You laid out.

35
00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:03.590
If I didn't do it, then it did.

36
00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.780
I did.

37
00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:06.780
You, you.

38
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.129
Thanks for saying that email for me.
