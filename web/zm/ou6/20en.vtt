00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
How did you know Jennifer was going to send that email?

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
How could she resist such a perfect opportunity to frame me?

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.449
Just as I thought.

4
00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:18.629
Mr. Grayson, I did such a good job.

5
00:00:18.629 --> 00:00:27.160
What's my reward?

6
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.160
Why me?

7
00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.350
Why did you marry me?

8
00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:32.350
Love that first sight.

9
00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:33.350
Really?

10
00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.640
All right.

11
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.820
Listen, I needed to get married to officially own the grazing group.

12
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.399
That was my initial reason.

13
00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.560
So, the company is what's most important to you.

14
00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.560
Yeah, and for now, absolutely.

15
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:55.780
Is there a chance that I could ever be more important in the grazing group?

16
00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:12.939
It depends on how badly you want it.
