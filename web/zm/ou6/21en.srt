1
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,500
Someone at work is messing with me.

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,500
What happened?

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:13,720
It is that new Secretary that leaves him on.

4
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,850
She is just out to get me.

5
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:22,850
Yeah, I heard that Liam was, uh, paying someone special attention to his new Secretary.

6
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:24,850
I'm still a major student.

7
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:27,519
Now, can Daddy do?

8
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:31,260
Deputy, I want her to disappear.

9
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:36,460
That wraps up the meeting, anyone have any questions?

10
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:39,100
I have something to say.

11
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,100
Mr. Grayson here.

12
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,100
Sure.

13
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:50,100
Uh, without realizing it has been favoring his new Secretary to the expense of his other employees and the company.

14
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,100
For the sake of fairness, I believe that we need to let her go.

15
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,100
Does everyone agree?

16
00:00:55,100 --> 00:01:01,899
Mr. Grayson, for the sake of the company, I recommend letting her go.

17
00:01:01,899 --> 00:01:02,899
Okay.

18
00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:03,899
Um, um, what if I disagree?

19
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:05,900
Well then, sir.

20
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:13,980
I'm afraid that I just don't see a future with this company and I would have to attend to my resignation.

21
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:14,980
Alright.

22
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:15,980
Fine.

23
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:19,359
Davis, you can go ahead and you can hand in your resignation.

24
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:22,359
Don't forget to, um, liquidate your shares.

25
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:23,579
Sir.

26
00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:25,579
Have you lost your mind?

27
00:01:25,579 --> 00:01:28,579
You're going to side with the Secretary over one of your major shareholders.
