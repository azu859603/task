00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.719
So, bitch. Ever since his dad died, he treats the rest of the shareholders like crap.

2
00:00:04.719 --> 00:00:09.839
Dad, without Grayson group support, our own pharmaceutical production mind might...

3
00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.629
If that's the case, then we're gonna have to take him out. Now it's Old Main Grayson's birthday,

4
00:00:17.629 --> 00:00:29.010
day and a half from now. You're coming to the party with me.

5
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:36.210
So, this is Miss Black, the woman who went from secretary to the wife of a CEO so very quickly.

6
00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:42.579
Oh, and she's fashionably late. Oh, woman has no respect for anyone, many of her stuff.

7
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.259
Yeah, I'm sorry. We actually got caught up prepping grandpa's present.

8
00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:57.899
Wow! Looks nice. Must have cost a fortune.

9
00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.939
Yeah, it looks like you've gotten very used to spending your new husband's money.

10
00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.019
Actually, I didn't cost Benny, but it is priceless.

11
00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:06.459
I bet you won't mind me opening it then.

12
00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:22.849
Really? I mean, come on, look around. A wine glass costs more than your crap.

13
00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:26.859
This doesn't belong here in neither do you.
