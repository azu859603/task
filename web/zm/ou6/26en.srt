1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:13,279
All right, it's not what it looks like.

2
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:15,310
Ow, ow, stop.

3
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:17,410
Simon, long time no see.

4
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:19,410
14 days in jail wasn't enough.

5
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:21,410
You just love spending your time by a bar.

6
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:22,410
Should I send this video to the police?

7
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:23,410
What do you want from me?

8
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:24,600
Just wait in the lounge.

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,600
Wait, Jennifer told you to do.

10
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:30,519
Oh, where's the door?

11
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:33,609
Oh, why is it so hot in here?

12
00:00:33,609 --> 00:00:36,219
Where does the door handle?

13
00:00:36,219 --> 00:00:39,280
Didn't think I'd swap the drunk wine glass, did you?

14
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,380
Girl was.

15
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:42,380
Whoa.

16
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:43,380
Oh, me.

17
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,380
There's something there though.

18
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:49,200
Alice has been gone for a while.

19
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,200
Liam, you should go check on her.

20
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:57,200
Actually, I just saw Alice and she was with some guy.

21
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,200
They were all over each other and they snuck off into the lounge.
