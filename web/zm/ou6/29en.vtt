00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The Grey's and Family made a fool of my daughter tonight.

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I don't see any reason for our families to cooperate anymore.

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.380
Come on, Jennifer. We're going.

4
00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:10.380
I'm going to go.

5
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.429
Hi.

6
00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:16.429
Do you think I took things too far tonight?

7
00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:18.429
Hey, none of this is your fault.

8
00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:20.429
All right, they were wrong from the start.

9
00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:25.059
Now the Cox family and the Grey's and the family are at odds.

10
00:00:25.059 --> 00:00:28.129
Don't worry, because I got a plan.

11
00:00:28.129 --> 00:00:36.729
Hey, Rod, why are we taking the detour?

12
00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:39.729
I'm sorry, boss. I'm not very familiar with this route.

13
00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:41.729
No, it's okay. Once you got it, you pull over.

14
00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:42.729
We'll call Tim to come get us.

15
00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:44.729
Boss, sorry. I can't stop the car.

16
00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:45.729
What do you mean?

17
00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:48.689
I'm so sorry.

18
00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:51.689
Hey, look, who's behind this? Look. Just pull over. I'll love you.

19
00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:56.689
Boss, I can't stop the car. They tampered with it. The brakes don't work.

20
00:00:56.689 --> 00:01:00.359
Rod, listen. You just pull over on the road sign, okay?

21
00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.359
And just drive at a steady speed.

22
00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:04.359
It's too late!
