00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,070
Oh, Liam.

2
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:28,940
Hello.

3
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:33,409
Nanny, you've been unconscious for three days.

4
00:00:33,409 --> 00:00:34,409
Where's Liam?

5
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:37,130
Liam, is he okay?

6
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:38,130
I have to see you.

7
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:40,070
No, no, no, no, don't go back.

8
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:40,909
I'll take you.

9
00:00:40,909 --> 00:00:47,859
I'll take you now to see him.

10
00:00:47,859 --> 00:00:52,479
Dr. said he's an acoma from the head injury.

11
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:55,020
I don't know when he'll wake up.

12
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,380
Listen, Alice, things have gotten really bad.

13
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:01,020
The company is like a battlefield.

14
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,820
George felt ill after Liam's accident.

15
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:07,099
The Cox family is trying to take advantage of the situation.

16
00:01:07,099 --> 00:01:20,439
I completely respect your decision.

17
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:22,840
I need to help Liam hold on to this company

18
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:27,379
and find out who was behind this.

19
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:29,390
They're going to pay.

20
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:34,540
All right, and I will help you.
