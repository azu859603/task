1
00:00:10,929 --> 00:00:13,490
Hey, Mrs. Grayson!

2
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:16,129
You know, since you are the CEO secretary,

3
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:18,289
you and I are gonna be spending a lot more time together.

4
00:00:18,289 --> 00:00:21,530
Mr. Cox, you're sitting in a seat that doesn't belong to you.

5
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:25,309
Doesn't that make you rather nervous?

6
00:00:25,309 --> 00:00:29,390
You still think that Liam can protect you?

7
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:32,030
Oh, you're just gonna have to learn how to watch him now.

8
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:33,189
Please, Leaf.

9
00:00:33,189 --> 00:00:34,789
Who do you think you are?

10
00:00:34,789 --> 00:00:36,789
Oh, that's right.

11
00:00:36,789 --> 00:00:37,789
You're my secretary.

12
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:41,070
Here is the agency agreement from Grayson Group,

13
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:46,140
signed by George Grayson, starting now I am the acting CEO of this company.

14
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,020
Is he insane?

15
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:52,969
You're an outsider, I have the second most sure effort, Liam.

16
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:54,130
That was just a copy.

17
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:55,890
The moon will be sent out shortly.

18
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,490
Do you know anything about running a company?

19
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:01,369
Do you?

20
00:01:01,369 --> 00:01:04,209
I heard you bankrupt seven companies in the past three years,

21
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:07,450
losing millions of dollars of Grayson family money.

22
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:24,260
If you don't back off, I'll send my legal team out to you.

23
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:26,739
Liam, what about all those promises you made?

24
00:01:26,739 --> 00:01:32,730
Flowers, the ring, the proposal?

25
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:35,079
You haven't kept any of them.

26
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:59,230
Why aren't you awake?

27
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:20,360
Where is that?

28
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,960
Quick, I saved my grandfather.

29
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,960
Go!

30
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,270
What happened?

31
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,550
He's flatlining.

32
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:29,550
We need emergency assistance at the VIP room,

33
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:36,469
emergency assistance stat.

34
00:02:36,469 --> 00:02:47,780
Trying to resuscitate Mr. Grayson, please leave, he needs space.

35
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:51,419
Mr. Grayson, Mr. Grayson, what's going on?

36
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:53,979
What's, talk to me, talk to me, look at me, look at me, look at me.

37
00:02:53,979 --> 00:02:55,060
Stay awake, stay awake.

38
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:59,349
Nurse, nurse, get in here now.

39
00:02:59,349 --> 00:03:02,189
And that concludes our recent internal adjustments.

40
00:03:02,189 --> 00:03:06,240
Are there any questions?

41
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,400
Meetings adjourned.

42
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:15,539
Oh, I have a little something.

43
00:03:15,539 --> 00:03:19,340
This is a 20% equity transfer document.

44
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:22,699
That is, stand by, George Grayson.

45
00:03:22,699 --> 00:03:29,150
Now, with my initial 10%, that makes me the largest

46
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:32,060
shareholder, which means I'm going to be calling the shares.

47
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:34,060
I don't know what underhanded tactics

48
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:37,330
you use to get those shares, but you are not the largest

49
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:38,330
share.

50
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:41,449
Liam still holds 30%.

51
00:03:41,449 --> 00:03:44,650
Liam is a bad shaball.

52
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:51,289
So it's either me or the guy who eats through a tube.

53
00:03:51,289 --> 00:03:58,710
Who says I'm a vegetable?

54
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:11,219
Liam.

55
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:13,610
You've been through so much.

56
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:16,300
Wow.

57
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,699
You should know that you're not the only 30% shareholder

58
00:04:18,699 --> 00:04:22,180
anymore, so you're also not the only one about me.

59
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:25,339
Because you killed the chairman for 20% of your shares.

60
00:04:25,339 --> 00:04:28,139
I have no commitment.

61
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:29,379
The chairman is dead?

62
00:04:29,379 --> 00:04:31,170
How'd this happen?

63
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,889
Wait, what are you saying?

64
00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:35,240
I couldn't save grandpa in time.

65
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:49,699
Because that night, I saw Mr. Cox leaving grandpa's room.

66
00:04:49,699 --> 00:04:51,620
You didn't notice the cufflink that was missing

67
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,019
on your right sleeve?

68
00:04:53,019 --> 00:04:56,019
It's just like the one on the other sleeve.

69
00:04:56,019 --> 00:04:58,839
I can't believe anyone would be so ruthless.

70
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:02,029
Kick him out.

71
00:05:02,029 --> 00:05:03,430
You have a cufflink.

72
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:04,790
Oh, big deal.

73
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:06,310
You have a cufflink.

74
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,149
Well, guess what?

75
00:05:07,149 --> 00:05:08,829
I was the only one at the hospital that night.

76
00:05:08,829 --> 00:05:10,110
You were there, too.

77
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,310
Maybe you killed him.

78
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:17,100
I have proof as well.

79
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,540
I was worried about someone trying

80
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,100
to hurt the chairman or Liam.

81
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,259
So I had surveillance cameras installed

82
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:23,939
in both of their rooms.

83
00:05:23,939 --> 00:05:25,569
You know what?

84
00:05:25,569 --> 00:05:30,139
I have time for this ridiculousness, what do you think?

85
00:05:30,139 --> 00:05:31,579
What do you think you're going?

86
00:05:31,579 --> 00:05:33,620
I already contacted the police.

87
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:43,339
You can tell them your side of the story.

88
00:05:43,339 --> 00:06:10,860
Does it hurt?

89
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,899
You just let all the hospital.

90
00:06:12,899 --> 00:06:14,720
Shouldn't you be resting?

91
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:55,220
I've missed you so much.

92
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,420
I heard her stalk tanked after Jennifer

93
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:00,300
pulled out the talk's family's investment.

94
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:04,000
Well, I won't back down, though.

95
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You know that painkiller that they've been secretly

96
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,379
producing overseas?

97
00:07:08,379 --> 00:07:10,540
Well, it doesn't mean international standards.

98
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:14,019
So grandpa, you look the other way for years

99
00:07:14,019 --> 00:07:15,060
because of old ties.

100
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:21,069
But no, I won't have any part of it.

101
00:07:21,069 --> 00:07:22,639
I have a plan.

102
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:23,160
Yeah?

103
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,500
What is it?

104
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,779
Well, since Davis is in custody,

105
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:29,660
I'm sure a lot of people, including Jennifer,

106
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,399
don't know that you're out yet.

107
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:45,230
We could put on a show.

108
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:52,329
It's Cox's year.

109
00:07:52,329 --> 00:07:53,810
Jennifer, Alice?

110
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:54,850
Long time no see.

111
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,889
Let's cut to the chase, all right?

112
00:07:56,889 --> 00:07:58,209
I want to talk about a partnership.

113
00:07:58,209 --> 00:08:00,699
Partnership?

114
00:08:00,699 --> 00:08:01,660
What partnership?

115
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:07,019
Your painkiller product line.

116
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:10,259
Liam's never been interested in that particular project.

117
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:13,500
Yeah, well, I'm not Liam, OK?

118
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,990
Well, we have other investors now.

119
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:18,029
We don't need grace and group support.

120
00:08:18,029 --> 00:08:20,189
Well, you might want to look at the terms

121
00:08:20,189 --> 00:08:35,899
first, just to make sure.

122
00:08:35,899 --> 00:08:43,830
I didn't expect Mrs. Grayson to be so generous.

123
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:47,419
Considered a gesture of goodwill.

124
00:08:47,419 --> 00:08:49,340
You know, I'm still getting my footing

125
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,259
with this whole CEO thing.

126
00:08:51,259 --> 00:08:56,250
Right, well, I will take this with me,

127
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,789
and I'll have to consider it.

128
00:08:58,789 --> 00:08:59,830
We'll have to consider it.

129
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:00,429
Of course.

130
00:09:00,429 --> 00:09:01,029
Right.

131
00:09:01,029 --> 00:09:02,149
I look forward to hearing from you.

132
00:09:02,149 --> 00:09:02,509
Yeah?

133
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:23,269
Thank you.

134
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:28,259
Hey, are you sure about this?

135
00:09:28,259 --> 00:09:29,870
Not really.

136
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,950
Their privately developed drug has always

137
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:35,490
been sold on the black market, but with the Cox family's

138
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:38,850
limited funds, my offer should be tempting.

139
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:46,789
You'll just have to wait and see.

140
00:09:46,789 --> 00:09:51,789
Looks like they took the bait.

141
00:09:51,789 --> 00:09:56,649
This is a gesture of good faith from us.

142
00:09:56,649 --> 00:09:59,289
This is definitely more detailed in my investigation.

143
00:09:59,289 --> 00:10:02,210
Of course, this is all confidential information.

144
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:04,509
Wait, what?

145
00:10:04,509 --> 00:10:10,620
You investigated us?

146
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,460
What?

147
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:14,019
Ms. Cox, where are you?

148
00:10:14,019 --> 00:10:16,259
The company swarmed with police.

149
00:10:16,259 --> 00:10:18,379
They say they're investigating our privately produced pain

150
00:10:18,379 --> 00:10:20,460
killers.

151
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,909
What?

152
00:10:21,909 --> 00:10:31,659
Do you have anything else you'd like to say?

153
00:10:31,659 --> 00:10:32,980
Liam?

154
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:35,179
You're awake?

155
00:10:35,179 --> 00:10:35,659
Hey.

156
00:10:35,659 --> 00:10:42,259
This?

157
00:10:42,259 --> 00:10:43,019
Jennifer, come on.

158
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:46,690
Cox family's been producing illegal drugs,

159
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:52,679
and now we've got concrete evidence.

160
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:53,960
How is you, bitch?

161
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,860
You nasty little porn.

162
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:01,340
How dare you walk over me?

163
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,220
I dare.

164
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,779
Because I've done nothing wrong.

165
00:11:04,779 --> 00:11:22,200
Everything I have, I've earned with my own merit.

166
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,799
I have been resting at home for seven months,

167
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:27,860
and the doctor said it was good for me to go on some walks.

168
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,659
I'm just bringing Liam some lunch,

169
00:11:29,659 --> 00:11:31,740
and I'll go right back home.

170
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:35,299
After all, it is our one-year anniversary of our meeting.

171
00:11:35,299 --> 00:11:37,659
I at least gladly am draggy, I hope.

172
00:11:37,659 --> 00:11:38,700
OK, Mom.

173
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:48,090
Love you.

174
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:49,779
Excuse me, ma'am.

175
00:11:49,779 --> 00:11:52,429
No entry without all the drinks.

176
00:11:52,429 --> 00:11:53,350
Are you new here?

177
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:53,909
I am.

178
00:11:53,909 --> 00:11:55,190
How's you know?

179
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:57,149
I'm the chairman's wife.

180
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:58,950
Can I go in now?

181
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:04,409
I'm about, I mean, I can call.

182
00:12:04,409 --> 00:12:07,720
Boss, this security guard is now.

183
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,539
Trotato?

184
00:12:10,539 --> 00:12:12,220
Wait a minute.

185
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:15,049
You and those sneakers?

186
00:12:15,049 --> 00:12:17,409
Even if you were the chairman's wife and bragging about it,

187
00:12:17,409 --> 00:12:20,179
you'd at least say you're the CEO's wife.

188
00:12:20,179 --> 00:12:22,419
Well, I was the CEO's wife.

189
00:12:22,419 --> 00:12:23,539
What?

190
00:12:23,539 --> 00:12:31,980
Look, stop daydreaming before I have to call for backup, OK?

191
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:35,169
Who is it?

192
00:12:35,169 --> 00:12:36,409
Mr. Grayson.

193
00:12:36,409 --> 00:12:37,809
I'm actually glad you're here.

194
00:12:38,289 --> 00:12:40,909
This woman right here claims to be your wife.

195
00:12:40,909 --> 00:12:48,860
Really?

196
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:51,220
I'm in a good mood today, so I won't fire you.

197
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,580
Thank you.

198
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,820
Thanks.

199
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,419
Much happiness to both of you.

200
00:12:55,419 --> 00:12:57,019
Thanks.
