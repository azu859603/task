1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:13,580
If only there had been any other way to get my son married, our texture is such a workaholic.

2
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:15,580
Texture is the perfect man for my Lillian.

3
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:17,579
My grandma must be so happy in heaven now.

4
00:00:17,579 --> 00:00:18,579
We shall leave.

5
00:00:18,579 --> 00:00:21,579
God bless us with grandchildren soon.

6
00:00:21,579 --> 00:01:07,189
It was set up by our mothers.

7
00:01:07,189 --> 00:01:09,189
But we did sleep together.

8
00:01:09,189 --> 00:01:10,189
I guess she's my wife now.

9
00:01:10,189 --> 00:01:19,079
We got the French headquarters in three hours for the opening ceremony.

10
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,079
Your private jet is ready.

11
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:21,079
We need a leak now.

12
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:22,079
I'll be right there.

13
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:25,519
Take care of my wife for me.

14
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:32,599
Hey kid.

15
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:34,599
What are you doing here all by yourself?

16
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:36,730
Take the police station.

17
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:37,730
Want to tag me along?

18
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:39,730
A little smart ass, huh?

19
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:41,730
Whoa, look what I got here.

20
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:42,730
Why don't we hang out?

21
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:44,730
I'll have plenty more in my car.

22
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:49,730
I only eat chocolate covered strawberries.

23
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:52,730
Or a little brat.
