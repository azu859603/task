00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:05.509
Have I seen him before?

2
00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:09.300
He's been gone for a long time?

3
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.300
Yes. Six years, it took him to establish the French headquarters.

4
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.300
Now he's on top of the Forbes list.

5
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:15.359
It's impressive.

6
00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:19.449
Oh, you shouldn't be impressed. You should be working.

7
00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:21.449
Tell me about the North downtown real estate project.

8
00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:31.410
Um, it's... it's, um...

9
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.409
Do you not answer a simple question?

10
00:00:33.409 --> 00:00:37.869
Why are you even here?

11
00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:38.869
Does anybody know?

12
00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:43.979
The project is in its second round of funding.

13
00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:47.240
They emailed over the contract this morning.

14
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.549
See that? That's competence.

15
00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:53.710
How did you even get here? Who hired you?

16
00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.710
I was referred by your mother, Mrs. Windsor.

17
00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.710
Let's no excuse for your raging incompetence.

18
00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.840
Terry, throw back into training and reassign her project to Lillian.

19
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.840
I want them in the best hands.

20
00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:05.840
Yes, sir.

21
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.840
The boss really lives up to his name.

22
00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.840
He was gone for six years, but he still knows this company inside out.

23
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.840
No, no, no, please.

24
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.840
I'll do better. I swear.

25
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.840
The CEO doesn't like when his employees cry.

26
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:18.840
Need to go.

27
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.260
Now!

28
00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:25.299
You are my personal assistant now.

29
00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:26.299
Why me?

30
00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:28.299
You get things done.

31
00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:30.299
And according to her files, you're a mom.

32
00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.400
That means I won't flirt with you.

33
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.530
Exactly. What's your name?

34
00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.530
Lillian.

35
00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.980
That name rings a bell.
