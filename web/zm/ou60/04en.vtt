00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.849
Not yet.

2
00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:16.370
Yes, you've got to make it up to her.

3
00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:18.370
I know, um, I will.

4
00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:20.719
All you care is work.

5
00:00:20.719 --> 00:00:24.839
Don't toggle you, go see your wife.

6
00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:30.140
Terry, what's a good reunion gift for my wife?

7
00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.140
Perhaps we should get a ladies' opinion.

8
00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.140
Well, Mr. Windsor, have you ever gotten a gift for your wife before?

9
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.460
No, I didn't get the chance.

10
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.460
But I want to make it up to her.

11
00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.460
My mother-in-law owns a lot of handbags.

12
00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.460
I suppose rich housewives love them.

13
00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.460
Can't go wrong with a nice handbag.

14
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.259
I'll leave that to you.

15
00:00:50.259 --> 00:00:53.259
Be the best one you can find. My wife deserves the best.

16
00:00:53.259 --> 00:00:54.259
Yes, sir.

17
00:00:54.259 --> 00:01:03.270
Lillian, word of advice.

18
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.459
Know your place.

19
00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:06.459
What do you mean?

20
00:01:06.459 --> 00:01:09.500
I mean, don't cross the line. As you can see, Dexter loves his wife.

21
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.500
Relax, Terry.

22
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.500
Mr. Windsor is just my boss. I took this job to support my kid.

23
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.500
Good. Just my mixture.

24
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:24.780
Sir, this is where Madam lives.

25
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:25.780
You want me to call?

26
00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.780
No. I'll go talk to her myself.
