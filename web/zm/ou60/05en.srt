1
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:06,049
Mr. Good-looking.

2
00:00:06,049 --> 00:00:09,050
Kid, what are you doing here?

3
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:12,109
I live here.

4
00:00:12,109 --> 00:00:15,419
How are you, kid?

5
00:00:15,419 --> 00:00:22,129
One, two, three, four, four.

6
00:00:22,129 --> 00:00:25,129
Four? I've been away for six years.

7
00:00:25,129 --> 00:00:27,129
I can't have a four-year-old son.

8
00:00:27,129 --> 00:00:29,129
My wife had a bastard child.

9
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:40,149
Why'd he leave?

10
00:00:40,149 --> 00:00:43,380
I was gonna introduce him to Mommy.

11
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:52,659
Hasn't your mom ever told you never to open the door for a stranger?

12
00:00:52,659 --> 00:00:57,659
My mom only said, don't give away personal info.

13
00:00:57,659 --> 00:01:00,659
I'm five-year-old, but I told him I was four.

14
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:03,359
Yeah, big difference.

15
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,359
One day you're gonna get yourself Kid Math, kid.

16
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:09,180
Terry, are you sure you have the right address?

17
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,730
Of course.

18
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:14,140
Denny, was someone at the door?

19
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:17,909
Terry, my wife's been cheating on me.

20
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:20,420
What? How do you know?

21
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:22,840
She's a four-year-old son.

22
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,969
I've been gone for six years.

23
00:01:26,969 --> 00:01:29,129
Do I need to show you the math?
