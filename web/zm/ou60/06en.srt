1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,430
Denny, was someone at the door?

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:07,589
Mommy, it's their good looking this year.

3
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:09,589
You opened the door to a stranger?

4
00:00:09,589 --> 00:00:11,589
Oh, he left something too.

5
00:00:11,589 --> 00:00:13,589
You don't open the door to strangers?

6
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:17,589
He's very good looking, like me.

7
00:00:17,589 --> 00:00:21,660
So, a random guy saves you from another random guy,

8
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,660
and now he knows where you live?

9
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:26,660
Tell Mommy what do you do the next time he comes here?

10
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:27,660
Call the police.

11
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:32,409
Add a boy.

12
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:35,500
Mommy, when is Daddy coming back?

13
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:41,549
Denny, did you open the door because you thought it might be Daddy?

14
00:00:41,549 --> 00:00:46,560
Daddy's not coming back.

15
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,560
Mommy can take care of Danny alone.

16
00:00:48,560 --> 00:01:04,780
Daddy is such a playboy.

17
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:05,780
Maybe.

18
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:08,030
Where did you learn that word?

19
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:11,599
Don't worry, Mommy.

20
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:15,599
I can pay Mommy's bills with Granny's card.

21
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:17,700
Denny, stop showing off.

22
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,700
You're only supposed to buy juice with this card.

23
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,700
I'll take it from you if you use it too much.

24
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,400
Well, I best go see what he left at the door.
