1
00:00:28.879 --> 00:00:30.679
My apologies, Mr. Weston.

2
00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:33.280
It seems Mr. Windsor is held up in traffic.

3
00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.340
Why would I complain when I have company as pretty as you?

4
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.340
Ugh, you have a kid?

5
00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.740
Yes, that's my five-year-old.

6
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.280
Your boss Dexter has great taste in employees.

7
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.039
Always picks the sweetest batch of cherries.

8
00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.240
Must be a true pleasure watching you bring around the paperwork.

9
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:58.939
I'm an assistant, Mr. Weston, not a plate of fruit.

10
00:00:58.939 --> 00:01:01.539
I bet you taste sweeter than fruits.

11
00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:03.640
I'm not a fan of unprofessional language,

12
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.120
and I don't want to rub you the wrong way.

13
00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:13.909
Just, uh, rub it the right way then.

14
00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:14.909
That's enough.
