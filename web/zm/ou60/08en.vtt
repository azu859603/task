00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.669
That's enough.

2
00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:07.889
Dexter, you're assistant, there's no sense of humor, not a good look for DM.

3
00:00:07.889 --> 00:00:12.689
It's over for me, I've offended Dexter's business partner, he'll fire me, I'm sure.

4
00:00:12.689 --> 00:00:17.649
The DM group is not interested in working with old perves who can't keep their hands to themselves.

5
00:00:17.649 --> 00:00:22.350
Watch your tone boy, I've been swimmer with the sharks long before you were born.

6
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.019
I don't feel like repeating myself, bankrupt the W group in three seconds.

7
00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.019
What are you?

8
00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:30.019
Drunk?

9
00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:33.020
You can't bankrupt the corporation just with a phone call?

10
00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.780
Three, two, one.

11
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:44.840
Someone's unloading major shares of our stock.

12
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.840
Panic selling?

13
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.840
Our stock is worthless now?

14
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.579
Mr. Windsor, I am so sorry, I misspoke about Lillian.

15
00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:55.579
It's too late.

16
00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:58.579
Oh please, Lillian, I was only joking.

17
00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:02.579
I'm just an assistant, I can't interfere with my boss's decision.

18
00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:03.579
Terry, get this disgrace out of here.

19
00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:04.579
He's blacklisted.

20
00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:05.579
Thank you, Mr. Windsor.

21
00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:17.569
Don't want us to come like that good to you.

22
00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:20.790
You are my assistant because of your work ethic.

23
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.790
You've balanced family and work well.

24
00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:24.790
I respect that.

25
00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.790
But what about your partnership with Weston's company?

26
00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.879
Companies will flock to work for us.

27
00:01:31.879 --> 00:01:34.879
We didn't get this far by compromising our morals.

28
00:01:34.879 --> 00:01:35.879
We're here for you.

29
00:01:35.879 --> 00:01:38.879
Wow, he's a lot nicer than I expected.

30
00:01:38.879 --> 00:01:44.329
If only my absent husband could be half as nice.
