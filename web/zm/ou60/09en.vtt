Thank you. Again, Mr. Windsor. Please let me know if there's anything I can do to help.

2
00:00:10.439 --> 00:00:20.609
Well, I have a friend who left his wife for several years. He came back to find a kid

3
00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.140
living with her. Any thoughts?

4
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.140
You think your wife cheated on you?

5
00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.140
My friends, wife?

6
00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:37.140
There must be a misunderstanding between him and Mrs. Windsor. Let's not jump to conclusions.

7
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.140
Maybe she's just babysitting for a friend. Why don't you just talk to her?

8
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.140
You're right. Give me some flowers. I'll go over to my wife's place.

9
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:53.579
No flowers for the friend. I'm just kidding. I'll have those ready right away.

10
00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:00.200
Dexter, have you visited your wife?

11
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.200
No.

12
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.200
You're ridiculous. It must have been so hard for Lillian to be his years.

13
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.780
Wait. Mom, what was, what was her name?

14
00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.099
Heartless Pastor. You don't need your wife's name?

15
00:01:12.099 --> 00:01:13.099
Just tell me.
