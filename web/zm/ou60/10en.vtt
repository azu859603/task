00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.690
Lillian, why is your name Lillian?

2
00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:04.690
Huh?

3
00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:07.910
There are thousands of people named Lillian around here.

4
00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.160
Right.

5
00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:11.160
Of course.

6
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.179
Just give me the flowers.

7
00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:15.179
The best you can find.

8
00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.179
He wants the best for his wife.

9
00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:19.179
What a lucky woman.

10
00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:25.899
Mr. Windsor, the flowers are in your car.

11
00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:32.179
Oh honey, keep those shoes on.

12
00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:34.179
We need you to go fetch your food delivery.

13
00:00:34.179 --> 00:00:36.179
Charles, you do this every time.

14
00:00:36.179 --> 00:00:37.179
I love you too, Bestie.

15
00:00:37.179 --> 00:00:40.179
Ten years and still go in strong.

16
00:00:40.179 --> 00:00:44.179
Charles said you won't do it once you've taken off your shoes.

17
00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:46.179
I ordered your favorite creak.

18
00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:47.409
That's more like it.

19
00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:49.409
Taking my bag inside.

20
00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:50.409
Yes ma'am.
