1
00:00:04,429 --> 00:00:10,919
Your word has five letters.

2
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:13,919
It starts with D and ends with a Y.

3
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:14,919
Daddy.

4
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:15,919
No, my turn.

5
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:16,949
Okay.

6
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:18,269
Hit me.

7
00:00:18,269 --> 00:00:21,219
It's a color.

8
00:00:21,219 --> 00:00:22,219
Orange?

9
00:00:22,219 --> 00:00:23,219
Yeah!

10
00:00:23,219 --> 00:00:26,250
What?

11
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,250
My turn.

12
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,250
Three of the five letters.

13
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:46,700
Sorry, we were playing a game.

14
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,700
Her boyfriend moved in.

15
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:51,929
I can't believe I was dumb enough to dig her side.

16
00:00:51,929 --> 00:00:54,280
You hit me in psycho?

17
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,280
You'll pay for this.

18
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:33,920
What happened to your face?

19
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,920
I opened the door for some psycho and he punched me.

20
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,980
Look in my face.

21
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:40,980
Denny, you said that a man was here earlier.

22
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:41,980
What did he look like?

23
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:47,219
Who's your guy good looking to?

24
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:49,219
Guys, you are way off track.

25
00:01:49,219 --> 00:01:51,219
You've got a psycho creeping on doors,

26
00:01:51,219 --> 00:01:54,340
punching people like a jack in the box.

27
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,340
Call the cops!

28
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,540
Okay, let's eat.

29
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:18,930
This looked like the flowers I got for Mr. Windsor's wife.

30
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:38,979
How did it go?

31
00:02:38,979 --> 00:02:45,710
Lillian cheated on me.

32
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:46,710
Lillian's a good girl.

33
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:47,710
She would never.

34
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,710
I saw her with a kid.

35
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:50,710
You dummy?

36
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:51,710
That is your child.

37
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,710
He called another man daddy.

38
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:56,710
We were only together for one night.

39
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:57,710
Now she has a four-year-old son.

40
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,219
Does that make any sense to you?

41
00:03:00,219 --> 00:03:04,219
Nevertheless, our family owes Lillian big time.

42
00:03:04,219 --> 00:03:06,219
You left without a word.

43
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:10,219
She was all by herself for six lonely years.

44
00:03:10,219 --> 00:03:14,969
Are you taking her side?

45
00:03:14,969 --> 00:03:16,969
She cheated.

46
00:03:16,969 --> 00:03:17,969
You want a divorce.

47
00:03:17,969 --> 00:03:18,969
I still want him.

48
00:03:18,969 --> 00:03:19,969
She do that.

49
00:03:19,969 --> 00:03:21,969
And Danny looks exactly like you.

50
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:30,550
Promise me you will give her a benefit of the doubt.

51
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:31,550
I'll handle it myself.

52
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:48,689
I've seen it enough.

53
00:03:48,689 --> 00:03:51,689
Terry, get a lawyer to prepare the divorce papers ASAP.

54
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:54,129
You just got back.

55
00:03:54,129 --> 00:04:04,740
Just get it done.

56
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,310
Let's meet him.

57
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,310
I need a drink.

58
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:20,129
Strong as a skunk.

59
00:04:20,129 --> 00:04:22,129
Get him at Ryu Kawak love house.

60
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:25,339
What happened?

61
00:04:25,339 --> 00:04:26,339
It's my boss.

62
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:27,339
I have to go.

63
00:04:28,339 --> 00:04:30,339
It is.

64
00:04:30,339 --> 00:04:33,300
I doubt Charles is awake right now,

65
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,300
and I can't leave you on your own.

66
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,300
I'll go.

67
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,300
I'll protect you.

68
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,319
All right.

69
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,319
Get dressed.

70
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:47,889
Stay here.

71
00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:49,889
Mommy has to go find the drunk boss.

72
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:50,889
No worries.

73
00:04:50,889 --> 00:04:52,889
Mommy, I'll be good.

74
00:04:52,889 --> 00:04:59,779
This place.

75
00:04:59,779 --> 00:05:15,399
I mean, his mommy's new.

76
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:18,519
Help her find your boss.

77
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:23,149
This is a billionaire-exclusive clubhouse.

78
00:05:23,149 --> 00:05:26,149
How did a little street bat like you get in a place like this?

79
00:05:26,149 --> 00:05:27,149
I'm not.

80
00:05:27,149 --> 00:05:29,500
Is that kid?

81
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,750
It has $8.8 billion.

82
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:32,750
Yeah, right.

83
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,750
Monopoly money?

84
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,750
Come on.

85
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:38,060
Even though his mom is unfaithful,

86
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,060
the kid is innocent.

87
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,740
Stop.

88
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:49,620
Is that how you treat a child?

89
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,620
You're fired.

90
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,620
Who are you to fire me?

91
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,620
This is a DM-owned high-end club.

92
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:58,620
Not some soup kitschy for brokeasses like you.

93
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,290
Don't worry.

94
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:03,290
I can take care of this with my money.

95
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:05,699
Stop messing around.

96
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:06,699
Yeah, little punk.

97
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:07,699
Watch your mouth.

98
00:06:07,699 --> 00:06:08,699
Beat it.

99
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:10,699
I've seen a lot of rich folk around here,

100
00:06:10,699 --> 00:06:12,699
and that ain't you.

101
00:06:12,699 --> 00:06:13,699
You're never going to get there,

102
00:06:13,699 --> 00:06:15,699
even if you work your ass off.

103
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:16,699
Security!

104
00:06:16,699 --> 00:06:17,699
Throw them out.

105
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:18,699
That's your boss.

106
00:06:18,699 --> 00:06:31,509
Our... our boss.

107
00:06:31,509 --> 00:06:38,149
You... you're...

108
00:06:38,149 --> 00:06:39,920
Terry.

109
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,920
EA of... the boss.

110
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,920
So he really is our...

111
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,879
Please, please, Mr. Windsor, don't fire me.

112
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:48,879
I'll apologize to your kid.

113
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:50,879
Please, please forgive me.

114
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,879
Please, please forgive me.

115
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:56,089
I'm following his own name.

116
00:06:56,089 --> 00:06:58,910
Beat it.

117
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:06,149
Good looking.

118
00:07:06,149 --> 00:07:08,149
You're actually a really nice person.

119
00:07:08,149 --> 00:07:11,149
I wish I could say the same thing about your dad.

120
00:07:11,149 --> 00:07:13,149
My dad is really not...

121
00:07:13,149 --> 00:07:15,370
Of course not.

122
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:18,370
Or everybody will know she's been cheating on me.

123
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:20,370
Are you a CEO, too?

124
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:22,370
There's some good bossing people around.

125
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:24,370
Kiddo, do you know what a CEO is?

126
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:25,370
Of course.

127
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:27,459
Be CEO one day.

128
00:07:27,459 --> 00:07:31,459
Look, kid, this isn't the park.

129
00:07:31,459 --> 00:07:33,459
We'll call your mom and get her down here.

130
00:07:33,459 --> 00:07:57,560
Where is Mr. Windsor?

131
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,560
Room 306.

132
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,579
Wait here.

133
00:08:01,579 --> 00:08:02,579
Here you go.

134
00:08:02,579 --> 00:08:04,990
Oh, Kiddo.

135
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:22,230
Mr. Windsor, I've been looking all over for you.

136
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:24,230
I just bumped into my wife's kid.

137
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:25,230
He's resting in this room.

138
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:26,230
Your wife's kid.

139
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:28,420
You mean your kid?

140
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,420
Is it because I'm not wearing a T-shirt that says

141
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,419
my wife cheated on me on the back?

142
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:33,419
I guess we'll never know.

143
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:38,340
It's like we're still buying into the cheating wife theory.

144
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:40,950
So is your wife in there, too?

145
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:44,950
No, the kid somehow found his way in without his mom knowing.

146
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:46,950
Yep, kids will do that.

147
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:48,139
You know kids well.

148
00:08:48,139 --> 00:08:49,139
Of course.

149
00:08:49,139 --> 00:08:51,139
I raised one myself.

150
00:08:51,139 --> 00:08:53,139
The father isn't in the picture?

151
00:08:53,139 --> 00:08:54,139
Oh, him.

152
00:08:54,139 --> 00:08:56,139
It's the same with her without.

153
00:08:56,139 --> 00:08:59,139
Sounds like Lillian also is a complicated marriage.

154
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:01,139
So, how old is your kid?

155
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:02,139
Four.

156
00:09:02,139 --> 00:09:03,139
Mine's five.

157
00:09:03,139 --> 00:09:04,139
He's here somewhere.

158
00:09:04,139 --> 00:09:06,460
Maybe they could be friends.

159
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:09,899
What's the cheater's kid we're talking about?

160
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:11,899
I could stay out of it.

161
00:09:11,899 --> 00:09:13,059
I don't say why not.

162
00:09:13,059 --> 00:09:15,059
His mom won't be here for a while.

163
00:09:15,059 --> 00:09:16,059
Wow.

164
00:09:16,059 --> 00:09:17,059
He is so kind.

165
00:09:17,059 --> 00:09:19,059
He won't take it out on an innocent child.

166
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:36,070
And I've been looking everywhere for you.

167
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:38,070
Come on, you guys.

168
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:39,870
Holy shit.

169
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,870
I've been waiting for you guys forever.

170
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,870
Let's get blackout drunk.

171
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:47,220
Mr. Winsworth, this is...

172
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,220
Oh, friend, I used to grow up with.

173
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:52,220
Lily, you look absolutely ravish.

174
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:55,220
I bet your decks are here treat you nice and easy at work, doesn't it?

175
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:58,509
Sir, please, I take my job very seriously.

176
00:09:58,509 --> 00:10:00,509
I'm sure you do.

177
00:10:00,509 --> 00:10:02,580
Why don't you come work for me?

178
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:03,580
I'll double your salary.

179
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,580
Really, Jamison?

180
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,580
Boaching my assistant in front of me?

181
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,580
Come on, decks.

182
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,580
I've never seen you this worked up about an assistant before.

183
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,580
You're just a little curious.

184
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,580
They better not get into a fight.

185
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,580
I'm thrilled that you think so highly of me.

186
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:18,379
I'll drink to the hat.

187
00:10:18,379 --> 00:10:19,379
I knew I liked you.

188
00:10:19,379 --> 00:10:26,269
I'll drink to the hat.

189
00:10:26,269 --> 00:10:27,269
I knew I liked you.

190
00:10:27,269 --> 00:10:37,019
Your kid is still here.

191
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:38,019
She has to drive me home later.

192
00:10:38,019 --> 00:10:40,019
I'll drink with you.

193
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:41,590
All right.

194
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:43,590
Well, then one won't cut it.

195
00:10:43,590 --> 00:11:10,659
Decks first pass down here, poor bastard.

196
00:11:10,659 --> 00:11:11,659
Why don't you take him upstairs?

197
00:11:11,659 --> 00:11:13,659
He's got a presidential suite.

198
00:11:13,659 --> 00:11:23,649
Professional my ass.

199
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:30,509
I'll go get you some water.

200
00:11:30,509 --> 00:11:32,509
Wait, stay here.

201
00:11:32,509 --> 00:11:35,820
He's not going to do anything to me, right?

202
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,860
He's married.

203
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:41,779
Mr. Windsor, sir, are you?

204
00:11:41,779 --> 00:11:49,450
It's me, Lillian.

205
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:50,450
Lillian?

206
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:52,539
My wife?

207
00:11:52,539 --> 00:12:00,059
My wife?

208
00:12:00,059 --> 00:12:03,500
Why did you betray me?

209
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,299
Because I was gone for so long.

210
00:12:06,299 --> 00:12:08,299
You got tired of waiting?

211
00:12:08,299 --> 00:12:11,259
What are you talking about?

212
00:12:11,259 --> 00:12:16,110
It's everyone close to me.

213
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,110
You bound to leave me.

214
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:19,110
Is he talking about his wife?

215
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:27,179
Lillian?

216
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:30,730
What are you doing here?

217
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:32,730
He must have thought I was his wife.

218
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:35,730
Sir, you had a lot to drink.

219
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:47,350
And I...

220
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,350
He is so devoted to his wife.

221
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:52,350
Being so respectful, even when he's drunk.

222
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:54,419
Come on, Lillian.

223
00:12:54,419 --> 00:12:55,419
Snap out of it.

224
00:12:55,419 --> 00:12:57,419
She shouldn't have cheated on him.

225
00:12:57,419 --> 00:12:58,419
This man is your boss.

226
00:12:58,419 --> 00:13:04,289
That must be his wife.

227
00:13:04,289 --> 00:13:15,600
Danny, how did you get here?

228
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,679
Mr. Mancher told me you're here.

229
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:24,909
This is a bad time.

230
00:13:24,909 --> 00:13:26,909
He is just my boss.

231
00:13:26,909 --> 00:13:28,909
Mr. Good-looking is your boss?

232
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:30,039
I approve.

233
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:32,039
Mr. Good-looking.

234
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:33,039
Do you know him?

235
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:36,059
I want him to be my dad.

236
00:13:36,059 --> 00:13:37,059
No, Danny.

237
00:13:37,059 --> 00:13:39,059
He's my boss and I'm his assistant.

238
00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:40,059
And that's that.

239
00:13:40,059 --> 00:13:41,059
Just quit.

240
00:13:41,059 --> 00:13:43,059
He missed my whack card.

241
00:13:43,059 --> 00:13:47,580
Danny, are you spending your dad's money to get back at him?

242
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:52,580
Besides, Dexter has more money than can fit on your black card.

243
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:55,789
Mom, he's making my daddy.

244
00:13:55,789 --> 00:14:00,419
No, he's married.

245
00:14:00,419 --> 00:14:02,710
End of discussion.

246
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:04,259
Fine.

247
00:14:04,259 --> 00:14:06,509
Who's over there?

248
00:14:06,509 --> 00:14:08,509
Um, nobody's served.

249
00:14:08,509 --> 00:14:09,509
Just me.

250
00:14:09,509 --> 00:14:15,289
Who's over there?

251
00:14:15,289 --> 00:14:17,289
Nobody's served.

252
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:18,350
Just me.

253
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:25,309
Where are you hiding me?

254
00:14:25,309 --> 00:14:28,570
He's kind enough to let me take you to work.

255
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:32,570
But sneaking into his room is a big no-no.

256
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:34,629
I'll find someone to come take you home.

257
00:14:34,629 --> 00:14:40,279
Good morning, sir.

258
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:43,299
Would you like some water?

259
00:14:43,299 --> 00:15:05,590
Work keeps dying at me.

260
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:08,870
How did I get here?

261
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:10,100
You were drunk.

262
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,100
You have no recollection?

263
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,450
No.

264
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:14,450
Good.

265
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:16,700
He didn't know Danny was here.

266
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:21,299
Did you stay here all night to take care of me?

267
00:15:21,299 --> 00:15:22,299
Where's your kid?

268
00:15:22,299 --> 00:15:24,529
He's fine.

269
00:15:24,529 --> 00:15:26,529
I had a friend come pick him up.

270
00:15:26,529 --> 00:15:27,529
Where's your husband?

271
00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:28,529
He's busy.

272
00:15:28,529 --> 00:15:29,529
You still love him?

273
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:33,389
I can't bore my boss with my personal matters.

274
00:15:33,389 --> 00:15:36,389
He's got a lot on his plate as it is.

275
00:15:36,389 --> 00:15:38,389
Of course I love my husband.

276
00:15:38,389 --> 00:15:39,389
Thank you for asking.

277
00:15:39,389 --> 00:15:42,000
Why does that bother me so much?

278
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
And get Terry.

279
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,889
Time for work.

280
00:15:46,889 --> 00:15:49,529
Good morning, everyone.

281
00:15:49,529 --> 00:16:02,669
Regina, here is your coffee.

282
00:16:02,669 --> 00:16:04,669
Double cream, no sugar.

283
00:16:04,669 --> 00:16:06,669
I don't want your coffee.

284
00:16:06,669 --> 00:16:09,669
Okay, what's going on?

285
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:10,669
Drop the act.

286
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:13,669
Everyone knows you slept with the boss.

287
00:16:13,669 --> 00:16:14,669
That's not true.

288
00:16:14,669 --> 00:16:15,669
Who told you that?

289
00:16:15,669 --> 00:16:21,809
He's wearing the same clothes from yesterday.

290
00:16:21,809 --> 00:16:24,809
And you guys arrived to work in the same car.

291
00:16:24,809 --> 00:16:25,809
He was drunk.

292
00:16:25,809 --> 00:16:27,809
I wanted to make sure he was okay.

293
00:16:27,809 --> 00:16:31,250
And I'm sure you made a move on him.

294
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,250
Must be nice.

295
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,250
You've got yourself a man at home.

296
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:38,779
And a man at work.

297
00:16:38,779 --> 00:16:40,779
That's not me.

298
00:16:40,779 --> 00:16:42,779
That's my friend.

299
00:16:42,779 --> 00:16:45,870
You know, you must be really good at making those time sheets

300
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:48,870
because you have so much time in your schedules

301
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:49,870
and all these men.

302
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:51,870
You have no proof.

303
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:53,870
I just really don't like cheating, bitches.

304
00:16:53,870 --> 00:17:03,639
Sorry.

305
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:08,740
Oh, and you're going viral and it's now a company scandal.

306
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,740
Our share prices took ahead.

307
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:13,740
Our boss worked so hard to build up his reputation

308
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,740
and you destroyed it unless it's not.

309
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:19,740
You really think he'll still want you around.

310
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,740
Mr. Windsor, I have to quit.

311
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:34,970
Mr. Windsor, I have to quit.

312
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:40,809
Is this about the rumors?

313
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:41,809
You heard?

314
00:17:41,809 --> 00:17:45,569
I know everything that happens in this company.

315
00:17:45,569 --> 00:17:54,740
He's not really into me, right?

316
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,740
Sir, if people see us like this,

317
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:57,740
the rumors will spiral out of control.

318
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:58,740
So what?

319
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,740
You can't control what we're going to say about you.

320
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,740
I never wanted this.

321
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:07,049
You should have cleared things up.

322
00:18:07,049 --> 00:18:08,049
Look, I have to quit.

323
00:18:08,049 --> 00:18:09,049
I won't let you.

324
00:18:09,049 --> 00:18:10,049
Why not?

325
00:18:10,049 --> 00:18:12,049
You worked so hard to get where you're at.

326
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:14,140
And now you're quitting because it's some stupid gossip.

327
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:15,140
Nobody will believe me.

328
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,140
So that's it?

329
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:18,140
You let them walk over you like this?

330
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,180
I'll give you half an hour.

331
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,180
Tell you what help.

332
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:25,740
Find out who started these rumors and get back to work.

333
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,740
Sir, are you trying to help me?

334
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:33,339
I don't have time for assistance.

335
00:18:33,339 --> 00:18:37,450
Sir, do you trust me?

336
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:38,450
Of course.

337
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:49,289
Make sure Lillian gets all the help she needs from the deck department.

338
00:18:49,289 --> 00:18:56,720
You're all right.

339
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,720
It's supposed to be that special.

340
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,720
Regina?

341
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,200
This is for slandering a coworker.

342
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:10,920
How dare you hit me?

343
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:13,920
This is for disregarding rules and spreading chaos in the company.

344
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,920
You?

345
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,920
And this is for women everywhere.

346
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,920
Do you know how much damage you can do with lies?

347
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,920
You're lucky I'm not taking you to court.

348
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,920
Kitty's got a clause.

349
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:23,920
I wouldn't mess with that.

350
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,920
Where's your proof?

351
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,920
You're crazy.

352
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:29,920
The tech department traced these photoshopped photos back to your company.

353
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:33,920
The tech department traced these photoshopped photos back to your computer.

354
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:37,920
How dare you spread rumors about your coworker and boss.

355
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,920
Apologize or quit?

356
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,920
So what?

357
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,920
You can't fire me.

358
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:45,920
I can fire you on Mr. Windsor's behalf because I know he doesn't tolerate dishonesty.

359
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:49,920
He wants all of his employees to be treated with fairness and respect.

360
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,109
Well said.

361
00:19:52,109 --> 00:19:56,339
Well said.

362
00:19:56,339 --> 00:20:04,140
Lillian is right.

363
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:07,140
I want to allow any of my staff to be defamed.

364
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:11,140
He heard me, but he's not mad that I spoke on his behalf.

365
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:14,140
Have any of you are so curious about what's going on between Lillian and I?

366
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:17,220
That would be a good time to speak on.

367
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,019
No.

368
00:20:19,019 --> 00:20:22,019
Then I better not have to hear another word about it.

369
00:20:22,019 --> 00:20:26,019
But Mr. Windsor, she has a complicated relationship with men.

370
00:20:26,019 --> 00:20:28,019
Lillian has always been professional.

371
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:30,539
And I can't say something about you.

372
00:20:30,539 --> 00:20:31,539
You're fired.

373
00:20:31,539 --> 00:20:32,539
What?

374
00:20:32,539 --> 00:20:33,539
And anyone involved will take a pay cut.

375
00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:34,539
No, please.

376
00:20:34,539 --> 00:20:36,539
No, I swear I won't do it again.

377
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:38,539
Please, I need this job.

378
00:20:38,539 --> 00:20:43,789
I need it.

379
00:20:43,789 --> 00:20:45,109
Lillian?

380
00:20:45,109 --> 00:20:48,380
What do you think?

381
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,380
I'm not a saint.

382
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:51,380
This is just overdue karma.

383
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,509
That's more like it.

384
00:20:53,509 --> 00:20:55,509
That's not my trust that assistance should be.

385
00:20:55,509 --> 00:20:57,509
Terry, get out of my face.

386
00:20:57,509 --> 00:20:59,509
Mr. Windsor, please.

387
00:20:59,509 --> 00:21:16,190
No, please.

388
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:17,190
I do your price, everyone.

389
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:21,299
He is such a gentleman.

390
00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:24,660
I really owe him a big one.

391
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:27,660
Alex, make sure my wife signs the divorce papers by tomorrow.

392
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,660
Why don't you ask her yourself?

393
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:30,660
It's not like you don't have her number.

394
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:35,509
She's shamelessly living with her lover amid our marriage.

395
00:21:35,509 --> 00:21:37,509
They even have a child together.

396
00:21:37,509 --> 00:21:39,509
I don't want anything to do with her.

397
00:21:39,509 --> 00:21:50,059
Yes, who is this?

398
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:53,980
This is Alex for divorce.

399
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,069
We ought to talk.

400
00:21:55,069 --> 00:22:04,740
I don't hear from him for six years, and the first thing he wants is a divorce.

401
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:10,319
Lillian is the messenger.

402
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:11,319
Let's proceed with dignity.

403
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:12,319
Clearly not.

404
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:13,319
Where should I meet you?

405
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:15,319
Sitting over the location right now.

406
00:22:15,319 --> 00:22:17,480
I'll have the papers ready.

407
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,799
See you there tomorrow.

408
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:29,210
Danny, will you be sad if your mommy and daddy get a divorce?

409
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:32,210
No, I want my mommy to be happy.

410
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:34,210
Mary, Mr. Good-looking.

411
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:36,210
He's a CEO, too.

412
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:41,210
Dexter is a good man, but too bad he's not for me.

413
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:43,210
That's not going to happen.

414
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:46,210
Mr. CEO's wife broke his heart.

415
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:48,529
I'm sure there's a way.

416
00:22:48,529 --> 00:22:50,589
I'm coming with you tomorrow.

417
00:22:50,589 --> 00:22:51,589
Yeah?

418
00:22:51,589 --> 00:22:53,880
What are you going to do?

419
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,880
I'll beat up that playboy for you.

420
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,710
All right.

421
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:03,710
You can come, but only if you stay in the lobby and don't run around.

422
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:21,549
Alex, it's nine o'clock.

423
00:23:21,549 --> 00:23:23,420
Where is he?

424
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,420
You should be here soon.

425
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,420
It's probably just traffic.

426
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:28,799
I'll be sure to brief the next wife.

427
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:31,859
Not sure how much she'll like waking up to an empty bed.

428
00:23:31,859 --> 00:23:35,859
Lillian, I've practiced law, not marriage counseling.

429
00:23:35,859 --> 00:23:36,859
Look, there's no need to wait.

430
00:23:36,859 --> 00:23:37,859
I'll just sign it.

431
00:23:37,859 --> 00:23:38,859
Are you sure?

432
00:23:38,859 --> 00:23:40,859
What if he changes his mind?

433
00:23:40,859 --> 00:23:43,859
He can have everything, except for our apartment.

434
00:23:43,859 --> 00:23:47,500
And in exchange, I get full custody of my son.

435
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,500
All right, then.

436
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:55,309
Just sign right there.

437
00:23:55,309 --> 00:24:02,130
You know, most people would kill for half of his fortune.

438
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:05,220
I'm talking about billions.

439
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,420
We don't need his money.

440
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,420
Great.

441
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:09,420
Notarization isn't a month.

442
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,420
We'll be in contact.

443
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,420
See you soon.
