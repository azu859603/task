1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,740
Stop.

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:08,740
Be my dad for a second, please.

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:10,029
Me?

4
00:00:10,029 --> 00:00:12,830
Your dad?

5
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:13,830
Thank you.

6
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:16,789
You're the best.

7
00:00:16,789 --> 00:00:23,149
Well, my dad is right here.

8
00:00:23,149 --> 00:00:25,149
He's not your dad.

9
00:00:25,149 --> 00:00:27,179
You're a liar.

10
00:00:27,179 --> 00:00:30,440
Even though things got ugly between me and his mother,

11
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,439
it had nothing to do with him.

12
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:33,439
He's just a kid.

13
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:34,439
He's not a liar.

14
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:36,570
I am his dad.

15
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,570
Well, your kid's a bastard and you're a punk.

16
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:42,570
Unlike my boy here, he's going to be head of Z Corporation one day.

17
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:45,570
Best believe I can bankrupt it right now.

18
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:46,920
You're smart.

19
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:47,920
You'd be on your knees right now.

20
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:48,920
You moron.

21
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,920
Then maybe I'd make you a janitor.

22
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:59,710
Bankrupt is Z Corporation in three seconds.

23
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:01,710
You're just full of jokes.

24
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,709
The only company that's a match for us is DM Group.

25
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:08,590
Three.

26
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:10,390
Two.

27
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:12,319
One.

28
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:16,810
Market Crash.

29
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:20,319
Corporation went bankrupt in three seconds.

30
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:23,319
Their loss has exceeded $10 billion.
