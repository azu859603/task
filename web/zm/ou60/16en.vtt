00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.720
That's Dexter's number. How did you call me?

2
00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:06.259
You win!

3
00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:07.780
I'm a round troublemaker.

4
00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:11.060
If I lose my job, I won't be able to buy you any more toy cars.

5
00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:23.019
It's a five-day business.

6
00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:25.019
Did you make arrangements with your family?

7
00:00:25.129 --> 00:00:27.210
Yes, I did.

8
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.289
Thank you for asking, sir. And how's your family?

9
00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.799
I'm divorcing my wife.

10
00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:38.079
Yikes.

11
00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:40.359
Seems like we're both going through it.

12
00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:45.520
He's been working non-stop to distract himself, but he's probably heartbroken.

13
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.579
By the way, you can call me Dexter.

14
00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:50.939
I consider us friends.

15
00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:52.670
Oh.

16
00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.179
Yeah, okay.

17
00:00:55.179 --> 00:00:56.179
Dexter, it is.

18
00:00:56.179 --> 00:01:07.340
No, it's nice to meet you.

19
00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:08.340
Great meeting you.

20
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.819
I do have a lot of priorities at the moment.

21
00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:11.819
Booked up until next month, so...

22
00:01:11.819 --> 00:01:12.819
Understandable?

23
00:01:12.819 --> 00:01:13.819
I'd like to have my assistant contact yours.

24
00:01:13.819 --> 00:01:15.819
My assistant's around me at all times.

25
00:01:15.819 --> 00:01:16.819
Okay.

26
00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:17.819
So, it'd be no problem.

27
00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:20.819
And she's very helpful with my business.

28
00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:25.140
Andrew Miller is a friend, so I'm sure the deal will be very lucrative.

29
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.989
Hmm.

30
00:01:27.989 --> 00:01:29.790
I'll bring it up in the next meeting.

31
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:30.790
Okay.

32
00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.370
Sounds good.

33
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.609
I'm at the border side, but I can't guarantee anything.

34
00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:39.409
But anything can happen, right?

35
00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:44.609
Look, if I close to this deal, would you let me back in the HQ?

36
00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:50.709
If you behave, HR will report to me.

37
00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:53.060
That's all I needed to hear.

38
00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.060
Cheers.

39
00:01:56.379 --> 00:02:00.099
I'm sure you'll change your mind after you sleep with me.

40
00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:07.049
Stop fighting, Dexter.

41
00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.039
Get off me, Eugene.

42
00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:10.039
I love you.

43
00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.039
Help you.

44
00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.949
What the hell are you doing?

45
00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:13.949
Stay out of it.

46
00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:15.110
You're just an assistant.

47
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.110
Get away from him.

48
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.460
Oh.

49
00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:18.460
Hit the road, Regina.

50
00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:19.460
Oh, yeah.

51
00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.460
Never step another foot in our HQ for as long as I'm alive.

52
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:24.460
Oh.

53
00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.699
You're burning up.

54
00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:32.620
Take me back to my room.
