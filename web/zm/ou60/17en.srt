1
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:13,390
I don't like my drink.

2
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:16,239
We need to get you to a hospital.

3
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:17,440
Not a chance.

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,899
I mean he'll have a field day.

5
00:00:19,899 --> 00:00:35,490
And our stock price, Terry.

6
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:36,750
Wait, wait, wait.

7
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:50,780
Hold on, Dexter.

8
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:53,729
Sorry.

9
00:00:53,729 --> 00:00:56,009
He is such a gentleman.

10
00:00:56,009 --> 00:00:59,090
Why would his wife ever cheat on him?

11
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:00,409
Hang in there.

12
00:01:00,409 --> 00:01:04,939
Terry'll be here soon.

13
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:07,540
My God, the suit really fooled us.

14
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:09,780
I never thought he'd be this hot.

15
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,989
She smells so good.

16
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:15,469
Why do I want her so bad?

17
00:01:15,469 --> 00:01:17,980
Am I losing my mind?

18
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:19,939
Are you firing any perfume?

19
00:01:19,939 --> 00:01:21,659
Oh no.

20
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:24,140
It must be my jacket.

21
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:27,409
Is it bothering you?

22
00:01:27,409 --> 00:01:28,609
What are you doing?

23
00:01:28,609 --> 00:01:30,730
Taking your clothes off in front of a man.

24
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:33,829
What are you thinking?

25
00:01:33,829 --> 00:01:36,829
Worrying about the suit.
