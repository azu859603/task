1
00:00:03,819 --> 00:00:07,219
Dexter was drugged. He's not himself right now.

2
00:00:07,219 --> 00:00:12,230
Keep your cool woman. Be professional.

3
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:36,280
Sir, you have a rash. I'll get the door.

4
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,020
Um, you're gonna have to apply the women on his chest.

5
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,960
I don't think that's...

6
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,960
I just cut my finger. You're gonna have to do it.

7
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,219
Hurry.

8
00:00:45,219 --> 00:00:51,960
Okay. Okay.

9
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,960
I've never seen a woman get this close to him before.

10
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:54,960
I should give you a medal.

11
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,460
Let's just focus, Terry.

12
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:01,750
Dexter, what are you gonna do to them?

13
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,549
I'm gonna make them pay.

14
00:01:03,549 --> 00:01:11,659
That's what you should do.

15
00:01:11,659 --> 00:01:13,659
Let them know they messed with the wrong guy.

16
00:01:13,659 --> 00:01:15,659
You got a real player on your team, boss.

17
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:27,209
Where do you live? Terry can give you a ride.

18
00:01:27,209 --> 00:01:30,209
Oh, thanks, but someone's actually coming to pick me up.

19
00:01:30,209 --> 00:01:32,209
Is it her husband?

20
00:01:32,209 --> 00:01:34,170
What's wrong?

21
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,519
I think her husband's coming to pick her up.

22
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:40,280
Let's leave them alone.

23
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,280
Dexter sounds sour.

24
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,280
Is Lillian going to be the new Mrs. Windsor?

25
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,030
Huh? Christian?

26
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:50,030
Mom!
