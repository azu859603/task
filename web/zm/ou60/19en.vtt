00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.820
I missed you so, so, so much.

2
00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:13.820
Were you good?

3
00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:14.820
Yes.

4
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.100
What's my black car?

5
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.199
Charles.

6
00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:21.059
What did I say?

7
00:00:21.059 --> 00:00:23.449
Charles, you're a grown up.

8
00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:25.449
You can't rely on a kid for money.

9
00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:26.449
Come on.

10
00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:27.449
Why don't we go to the car?

11
00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.449
You look like you're starving.

12
00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:32.109
Where's your boss?

13
00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:34.109
Mr. Good-looking was busy.

14
00:00:34.109 --> 00:00:35.109
He had to go back to work.

15
00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:37.109
But you won't have time today.

16
00:00:37.109 --> 00:00:39.109
Danny, for the millionth time.

17
00:00:39.109 --> 00:00:41.109
I told you nothing is happening between us.

18
00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:43.109
I am going to make sure.

19
00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:45.109
You call Mr. Good-looking.

20
00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:46.109
Don't you dare.

21
00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:49.109
Charles, you want lobster?

22
00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:51.109
At your service.

23
00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:56.439
Mr. Good-looking?

24
00:00:56.439 --> 00:00:57.439
It's me.

25
00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:59.439
Do you have a time today with my mom?

26
00:00:59.439 --> 00:01:00.439
No.

27
00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:01.439
What's wrong with this kid?

28
00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:03.369
His mom cheats on me.

29
00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:05.370
He still wants me to go on a date with her?

30
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.370
Maybe she regrets on asking for more on the settlement.

31
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:09.370
Yeah.

32
00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:10.370
Or she can keep dreaming.

33
00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.939
I told you so.

34
00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:17.939
I'm going to make sure Mr. Good-looking dates mommy.
