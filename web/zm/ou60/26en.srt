1
00:00:01,649 --> 00:00:03,049
Divorce?

2
00:00:03,049 --> 00:00:09,929
Dexter, don't forget your court date as December 12th.

3
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:17,339
Lillian, how are things between you and your husband?

4
00:00:17,339 --> 00:00:19,940
Dexter has been very honest with me.

5
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:22,629
I should do the same.

6
00:00:22,629 --> 00:00:24,429
I just signed the divorce papers.

7
00:00:24,429 --> 00:00:25,960
That's great.

8
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:26,989
Up.

9
00:00:26,989 --> 00:00:29,420
No, I'm sorry.

10
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:31,469
You must be upset.

11
00:00:31,469 --> 00:00:35,350
I don't really feel anything for him.

12
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:39,020
So, I'm glad we parted on good terms.

13
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:40,880
I thought you said you loved him.

14
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:42,479
I lied.

15
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:45,479
I'm sorry, I didn't want to bore you with all that.

16
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:48,079
How is it going with your wife?

17
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:49,079
Same here.

18
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:50,880
We're finalizing the divorce now.

19
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,539
Well, good luck with your next romance.

20
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:56,909
I hope it gets better.

21
00:00:56,909 --> 00:00:58,509
Yeah, you do.

22
00:00:58,509 --> 00:01:02,950
Have a chance with Dexter.

23
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:04,950
Maybe no, I have a chance with Lillian.
