00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.429
I should probably go.

2
00:00:06.429 --> 00:00:07.429
I don't want you to leave.

3
00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:09.429
Does he mean he likes me?

4
00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:11.429
Or am I overthinking again?

5
00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.429
I have a kid.

6
00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:15.429
God, why am I saying this?

7
00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:24.039
You're a caring mother, and a professional at work.

8
00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:29.710
You're kind, brilliant, and reliable.

9
00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:35.820
To me, you're one of a kind.

10
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:58.630
Lillian, I meant every word I said.

11
00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.630
And in fact, there's so much more than I want to say to you.

12
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:10.260
Look, if you don't see me the way I see you, just say it to my face.

13
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:17.079
Dexter, I'm still technically married.

14
00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:20.099
Just give me time.

15
00:01:20.099 --> 00:01:38.730
Wait, Lillian lives in the same apartment as my cheating wife?
