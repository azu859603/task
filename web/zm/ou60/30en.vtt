1
00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:08.320
Thank you, Jamison. I hope to continue working together.

2
00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:22.780
What did you put in my drink?

3
00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.379
She's all yours, Jamison. Enjoy.

4
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.140
You know, I think it might be better for both of us if you just at least try to make sure you...

5
00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.679
Please. Let me go.

6
00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:42.679
Let you go.

7
00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:47.100
Well, no woman can escape me once I have her in my sleep.

8
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:53.450
Stop! Stop!

9
00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.719
Don't dare you touch my woman.

10
00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.719
Regina said she was just some girl you used to sweeten deals.

11
00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:03.719
Give me the police and find Regina.

12
00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.719
Make her pay for this.

13
00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:07.719
And bankrupt Jamison Brown.

14
00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:09.719
I'm sorry, Dexter. I had no idea she was your woman.

15
00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:10.719
Look, yeah, I got here in time.

16
00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:14.719
Have you got any further? I've taken a pound of blush for payment.

17
00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:17.719
I'm sorry, Dex. All right? We've been friends since like forever.

18
00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:21.200
Bankrupt Jamison Brown in three seconds.

19
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.200
Dexter, please shut up.

20
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.420
Get the fuck off of me.

21
00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.920
Go.

22
00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:30.920
Are you okay?

23
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.120
Just a bit drowsy.

24
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:49.450
There's been something I've been meaning to get off my chest.

25
00:01:49.450 --> 00:02:06.400
Lillian, I love you. I need you.

26
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:13.740
You too?

27
00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.740
So I wasn't scaring you with the whole love thing, was I?

28
00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:17.740
Never.

29
00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.770
You're not just saying yes because I'm your boss, right?

30
00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.800
No, Dexter, you idiot.

31
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.680
I'm sure I'm quite ready to walk in, Mr. Windsor.

32
00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:41.039
You do this to all your secretaries?

33
00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:42.039
Just you.

34
00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:45.740
Once I finalize my divorce, make us official.

35
00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.449
I'll do the same.

36
00:02:47.449 --> 00:03:02.280
I'm not going anywhere else, Alex.

37
00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:13.689
Dexter.

38
00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:14.689
Dexter.

39
00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:16.460
Lillian.

40
00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:17.900
What are you doing here?

41
00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.900
I'm here for my divorce.

42
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.740
Me too.

43
00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:22.740
What are the odds?

44
00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.979
Where's your husband?

45
00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:28.590
He should be in there right now.

46
00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:29.590
Where's your wife?

47
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:30.849
Inside.

48
00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:32.740
Ready to go?

49
00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.740
I can't believe we're getting divorced on the same day.

50
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.740
And we're starting the new chapter together.

51
00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:46.180
That's pretty wild.

52
00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.180
No, I thought you were supposed to pick him up from school.

53
00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.180
I got here, and the teacher said he left a long time ago,

54
00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.180
and he's not answering my calls.

55
00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.180
Denny is a smart kid.

56
00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.180
He wouldn't leave school without telling anyone.

57
00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.180
I'm calling the police.

58
00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.180
Dexter, my kid is missing.

59
00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:00.180
I'm going with you.

60
00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.250
But what about your divorce?

61
00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:03.250
Your kid is a priority.

62
00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.340
I can't get divorced any day.

63
00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:23.430
I don't know you.

64
00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.430
Your mom stole my man.

65
00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.389
I'm sure you got the right kid.

66
00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:29.389
Yes.

67
00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:30.389
I followed you.

68
00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:32.389
I know your mom, Lillian,

69
00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:34.389
picks you up from school every afternoon.

70
00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:36.389
Yikes, lady.

71
00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:38.389
That's talking.

72
00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:40.389
Did you say she stole your man?

73
00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:41.389
Yes.

74
00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:42.389
Her boss, Dr. Windsor.

75
00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:43.389
Happy about it.

76
00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:48.050
Mr. Good looking will be now.

77
00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.910
You know, kidnapping is a serious crime.

78
00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.670
No one will know it was me.

79
00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:03.769
You want Mommy to leave her boss?

80
00:05:03.769 --> 00:05:06.769
Let me go, and I'll make it happen.

81
00:05:06.769 --> 00:05:12.300
Do I look like I'm five years old?

82
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:13.300
I don't.

83
00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:14.300
I'm going to kill you.

84
00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:20.430
And your Mommy is going to regret it for the rest of her life.

85
00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:27.300
Denny's watch says he's here.

86
00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:54.170
Mr. Good looking.

87
00:05:54.170 --> 00:06:00.029
It's you.

88
00:06:00.029 --> 00:06:02.029
You're Lillian's son?

89
00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:03.379
Yes.

90
00:06:03.379 --> 00:06:04.379
This is my son.

91
00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:05.379
She's my Mommy.

92
00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:10.259
Denny, how old are you?

93
00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:11.259
I'm five.

94
00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:13.259
I'm sorry I'm not.

95
00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:18.110
Who was that guy in your apartment?

96
00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:19.660
Charles?

97
00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:20.910
He's my friend.

98
00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:21.910
Wait.

99
00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:23.259
Who's your husband?

100
00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:24.259
I never saw him.

101
00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:29.259
We've been married for six years and out of the blue he files for divorce.

102
00:06:29.259 --> 00:06:32.290
The lawyer who's been contacting you.

103
00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:33.290
His name's Alex?

104
00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:34.290
Yes.

105
00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:35.290
How did you know?

106
00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:40.300
Alex is my lawyer.

107
00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:41.579
What?

108
00:06:41.579 --> 00:06:44.899
You're my wife.

109
00:06:44.899 --> 00:06:47.730
Denny's my son.

110
00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:49.339
What?

111
00:06:49.339 --> 00:06:53.569
You're my wife.

112
00:06:53.569 --> 00:06:56.459
Denny's my son.

113
00:06:56.459 --> 00:06:57.459
What?

114
00:06:57.459 --> 00:06:58.459
What?

115
00:06:58.459 --> 00:07:08.860
No, we missed each other this whole time.

116
00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:17.779
I'm sorry I wasn't going to actually hurt him.

117
00:07:17.779 --> 00:07:20.779
Lady, you had a knife.

118
00:07:20.779 --> 00:07:23.779
Who needs the cops when an apology is all you need?

119
00:07:23.779 --> 00:07:25.220
Dexter?

120
00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:26.220
Help me.

121
00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:27.220
Think about your Mom.

122
00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:28.220
Regina.

123
00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:29.220
What you did is unforgivable.

124
00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:31.220
You'll be going away for a long time.

125
00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:33.579
I did it because I love you.

126
00:07:33.579 --> 00:07:34.579
Love?

127
00:07:34.579 --> 00:07:36.579
You have no idea what love is.

128
00:07:36.579 --> 00:07:42.949
Well, I mean, as a kid with another man, clearly she's not your perfect match.

129
00:07:42.949 --> 00:07:44.949
Lillian, is my wife.

130
00:07:44.949 --> 00:07:49.459
Head out of the father of her child.

131
00:07:49.459 --> 00:07:50.459
What?

132
00:07:50.459 --> 00:07:55.970
It's the truth.

133
00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:57.129
She's my wife.

134
00:07:57.129 --> 00:08:00.129
What goes around comes around Regina.

135
00:08:00.129 --> 00:08:01.259
Send her away.

136
00:08:01.259 --> 00:08:06.930
No!

137
00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:07.930
I still don't get it.

138
00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:11.790
I thought you got your wife a handbag and flowers.

139
00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:12.790
About the bag.

140
00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:17.050
When Denny told me he was four years old, I thought you cheated him.

141
00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:19.050
So I threw it in the way.

142
00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:20.050
And the flowers?

143
00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:24.050
At that time, I heard Denny call another man, Dad.

144
00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:27.050
You thought my friend was the man I was cheating with you on?

145
00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:29.259
Yes.

146
00:08:29.259 --> 00:08:33.539
If we had done this sooner, it wouldn't have taken us so long.

147
00:08:33.539 --> 00:08:37.879
Lillian, I'm sorry.

148
00:08:37.879 --> 00:08:40.649
I thought my emotions get the best of me.

149
00:08:40.649 --> 00:08:42.649
Mr. Good-looking.

150
00:08:42.649 --> 00:08:43.649
You kicked ass.

151
00:08:43.649 --> 00:08:45.970
Denny, you finally got your wish.

152
00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:47.970
But why are you still calling him Mr. Good-looking?

153
00:08:47.970 --> 00:09:10.379
Been a few door twice.

154
00:09:10.379 --> 00:09:12.509
It was the first time I get to see inside.

155
00:09:12.509 --> 00:09:14.509
This is your home now, too.

156
00:09:14.509 --> 00:09:19.509
Stay here.

157
00:09:19.509 --> 00:09:21.509
I'll get the door.

158
00:09:21.509 --> 00:09:32.480
Mom, what are you doing in here?

159
00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:34.480
I'm here to apologize.

160
00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:36.480
I am so sorry, Lillian.

161
00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:38.480
I just heard about what happened with Regina.

162
00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:42.080
It's over now.

163
00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:45.080
Are you two still going to get a divorce?

164
00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:47.899
Never.

165
00:09:47.899 --> 00:09:48.899
Good.

166
00:09:48.899 --> 00:09:53.289
Lillian, do you still consider me your mother-in-law?

167
00:09:53.289 --> 00:09:55.289
You always will be.

168
00:09:55.289 --> 00:10:02.519
Lillian, it might be grand fun.

169
00:10:02.519 --> 00:10:05.519
Let's move into Granny's house today, okay?

170
00:10:05.519 --> 00:10:21.779
To Granny's.

171
00:10:21.779 --> 00:10:25.100
So, honey, how are you sleeping in his desk?

172
00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:26.100
Very well.

173
00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:29.100
I sleep like a baby on that $2 million mattress.

174
00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:31.139
Wish I could say the same.

175
00:10:31.139 --> 00:10:32.139
What's wrong?

176
00:10:32.139 --> 00:10:36.090
Do you need a new pillow?

177
00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:41.409
We've been married for six years, and yet we're sleeping in different beds.

178
00:10:41.409 --> 00:10:46.409
Remind me, who decided to go overseas for six straight years?

179
00:10:46.409 --> 00:10:48.409
You spend every night with Denny.

180
00:10:48.409 --> 00:10:50.409
It won't be my turn.

181
00:10:50.409 --> 00:10:52.629
Why don't the three of us sleep together?

182
00:10:52.629 --> 00:10:53.629
No.

183
00:10:53.629 --> 00:10:54.629
That'd be kind of productive.

184
00:10:54.629 --> 00:10:57.179
She is Dexter.

185
00:10:57.179 --> 00:10:59.179
So eager.

Denny can spend the day with me.

187
00:11:01.529 --> 00:11:02.529
Are you sure?

188
00:11:02.529 --> 00:11:03.529
Yes.

189
00:11:03.529 --> 00:11:07.659
She is.

190
00:11:07.659 --> 00:11:18.480
Granny, why don't you mommy and daddy go?

191
00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:27.379
Denny, do you want a baby brother or a baby sister?
