00:00:05.169 --> 00:00:11.740
So congratulations, you're pregnant with twins.

2
00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.099
How is this possible?

3
00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:28.260
He leaves my fertile.

4
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.719
Hello, there's a line behind you.

5
00:00:31.719 --> 00:00:39.380
I'm so sorry, just give me one second.

6
00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.460
Wow, who doesn't have 250?

7
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.500
Move if you can't afford a bag of chips.

8
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:56.229
No, I won't just...

9
00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:57.710
Did you transfer my money?

10
00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.469
I've only got 80 cents left.

11
00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:02.990
I told you, college is a waste of time.

12
00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.990
Come home, I...

13
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:08.569
I told my tuition is due next Thursday.

14
00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:11.370
Your brother, I needed more cash, so I took...

15
00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:12.530
That's what families do.

16
00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:13.730
What about me?

17
00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:15.239
Cry me a riverilla.

18
00:01:15.239 --> 00:01:16.859
Other comes first.

19
00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:19.659
I need money, I need to go to school.

20
00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:27.659
That's what you like?

21
00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.569
Down's a little distress.

22
00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:30.730
Get out.

23
00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:57.510
If you need more money, come here.
