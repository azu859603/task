1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.240
She doesn't deserve it.

2
00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:04.240
What do you mean?

3
00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:12.970
I just need ten.

4
00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:14.970
Ten grams should cover my delicious.

5
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.500
Ten million?

6
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.820
That's always about what I have.

7
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:21.949
Done.

8
00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:26.649
I made sure she's financially set for life.

9
00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:29.649
After she gives birth, the babies will come home with us.

10
00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:31.649
Sebastian Harrington.

11
00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:33.649
That is not how I raised you.

12
00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:35.649
Go find her now.

13
00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:38.159
Dylan, you're scaring me.

14
00:00:38.159 --> 00:00:39.159
Don't be.

15
00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:41.159
You're a sister.

16
00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:43.189
All I've ever needed is money.

17
00:00:43.189 --> 00:00:45.189
And you're my newest payday.

18
00:00:45.189 --> 00:00:47.189
Dylan, I'm her new cook.
