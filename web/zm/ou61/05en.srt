1
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:21,769
You know, pretty face like Eris can make me some serious cash on the black market.

2
00:00:21,769 --> 00:00:24,469
Dylan, please, we're family.

3
00:00:24,469 --> 00:00:27,480
Yes, family helps family.

4
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,480
Right?

5
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:39,119
Dylan, I'm pregnant.

6
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:40,509
What?

7
00:00:40,509 --> 00:00:42,539
Who's the father?

8
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:45,600
What old bastard did you spare?

9
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,100
Sebastian Harrington.

10
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,100
Sebastian Harrington.

11
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,939
Head of Harrington Enterprises.

12
00:00:53,939 --> 00:00:57,939
Youngest CEO, controls industries, governments, even the mob.

13
00:00:57,939 --> 00:01:04,959
He knocked you up, you!

14
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,959
I gotta renegotiate with the buyers.

15
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:07,959
Pregnant horse.

16
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:22,829
It's a money market.

17
00:01:22,829 --> 00:01:24,829
Maybe he doesn't even remember who I am.

18
00:01:24,829 --> 00:01:35,670
Hillary transferred 10 grand to the University Finance Office.

19
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:37,670
I believe it's for her tuition this semester.

20
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:45,010
Go and find her now.

21
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:58,239
Bitch!

22
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:00,239
Someone, anyone.
