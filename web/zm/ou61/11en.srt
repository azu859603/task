1
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:10,259
Goodnet? I'll show you how to use the housing system.

2
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:13,490
Oh my god, I'm so sorry that I break anything.

3
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:16,489
No, sweetheart, you didn't break anything.

4
00:00:16,489 --> 00:00:19,809
I'm Seb's mom, Elizabeth.

5
00:00:19,809 --> 00:00:21,000
Elizabeth?

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Oh, please call me Eliza.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
How do you like your room?

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
If it's not to your liking, Seb can take you to the lakeside villa.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,250
This is fine.

10
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,109
Your family.

11
00:00:34,109 --> 00:00:37,369
If you need anything, just let Seb know.

12
00:00:37,369 --> 00:00:43,350
Everything's great, Mrs. Eliza.

13
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:47,350
Why don't you join me at the mall this afternoon?

14
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:51,350
I know Seb's fashion sense is lacking.

15
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:53,350
Would you like to keep the cupboard?

16
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:56,719
Sure.

17
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,950
Let's see what's here.

18
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:09,959
Oh, oh, look at this.

19
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:12,180
Try this one on Ella.

20
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,180
I thought we were shopping for you.

21
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:18,099
Oh, we're shopping for both of us.

22
00:01:18,099 --> 00:01:29,640
Go on, let's try the mall.

23
00:01:29,640 --> 00:02:07,310
Your absolutely stunning sweetheart will take the mall.

24
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:12,259
Don't we have to pay first?

25
00:02:12,259 --> 00:02:16,219
I own this mall. Have them shipped from my address.

26
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:30,669
Of course, that was so much fun.

27
00:02:30,669 --> 00:02:32,180
Let me eat.

28
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:35,219
Wear more blue, you know, more often.

29
00:02:35,219 --> 00:02:37,219
Make your eyes pop.

30
00:02:37,219 --> 00:02:39,500
Come on, let's get some food.

31
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:47,199
Yeah, what do you want?

32
00:02:47,199 --> 00:03:22,479
Sebastian?

33
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:24,479
No touching unless you are buying.

34
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:26,479
I'm sorry.

35
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:28,479
No, this place is not for you.

36
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:29,479
Try Walmart.

37
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:33,629
That's more your speed.

38
00:03:33,629 --> 00:03:35,629
Those are knockoffs, right?

39
00:03:35,629 --> 00:03:37,919
So desperate to look rich.

40
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:39,270
They're knockoffs.

41
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:41,620
I just bought them here.

42
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,169
Oh, yeah.

43
00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:45,710
Got any receipts?

44
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:47,710
That's what I thought.

45
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:49,710
Now get out.

46
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,860
Is everything okay, babe?

47
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:57,060
Is everything okay, babe?

48
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:02,539
Mr. Sebastian Harrington, if you need anything, please let me know.

49
00:04:02,539 --> 00:04:05,879
You want to try out some shoes?

50
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,879
No, it's okay.

51
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:18,490
Let's try out some shoes.

52
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:20,490
Can you help my wife put them on?

53
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:34,779
Get used to this, Emma.

54
00:04:34,779 --> 00:04:35,779
Not her style.

55
00:04:35,779 --> 00:04:36,779
Try the black pair.

56
00:04:36,779 --> 00:04:46,519
No, not those ones.

57
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:50,220
Mmm, ugly.

58
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:54,420
I don't like them.

59
00:04:54,420 --> 00:05:01,060
You can't do any better than that.

60
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,269
Maybe the blue?

61
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:05,269
Or maybe we should try a different shop.

62
00:05:05,269 --> 00:05:12,259
Go meet Mom.

63
00:05:12,259 --> 00:05:13,259
I'll catch up.

64
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:20,680
Mr. Harrington, I didn't know that she was your wife.

65
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,680
You're fired.

66
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:38,810
Tonight we have our finest beluga caviar, sourced from the Caspian Sea.

67
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:39,870
Go ahead.

68
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:54,649
Oh my God, did you see the way she ate that?

69
00:05:54,649 --> 00:05:59,129
I bet she's never had caviar her entire life.

70
00:05:59,129 --> 00:06:12,379
Miss, the caviar is best served with the seashell spoon.

71
00:06:12,379 --> 00:06:14,379
Not necessarily.

72
00:06:14,379 --> 00:06:24,019
You eat how you want, hold on.

73
00:06:24,019 --> 00:06:27,500
Never let anyone tell you how to live your life.

74
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:40,500
No one's ever told me that, but he seems different.

75
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:47,540
Thank you.

76
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,540
Mr. Harrington.

77
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,540
Ella, wait.

78
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:59,019
Take that.

79
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:01,019
You've already given me so much.

80
00:07:01,019 --> 00:07:03,019
And there will be more to come.

81
00:07:03,019 --> 00:07:12,740
Like I said, I need to get used to it.

82
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:15,579
I'll see you in the afternoon, Ella.

83
00:07:15,579 --> 00:07:17,579
See you, Mr. Harrington.

84
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:23,600
Hey, Ella.

85
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,300
Is Ella sitting with Aiden?

86
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,300
Oh my God, she is.

87
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:31,500
What is she wearing?

88
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,500
That looks like the new limited collection from Lemire Prestige.

89
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,170
How could she afford those?

90
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:40,170
Isn't Lemire Prestige like crazy expensive?

91
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:41,170
It is.

92
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:43,170
She must be wearing it.

93
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:44,170
Just use Aiden.

94
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:54,310
So, how does a low life like you even afford Lemire Prestige?

95
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:56,310
Is it the sugar daddy or something?

96
00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:01,389
I don't know where you're getting that from, but no.

97
00:08:01,389 --> 00:08:03,389
Sabrina, look at this.

98
00:08:03,389 --> 00:08:04,389
This is the newest model.

99
00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:06,389
It costs like 10k.

100
00:08:06,389 --> 00:08:10,389
Just admit it, you sold yourself to some ritual fraud.

101
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:12,389
Hey, watch your tone.

102
00:08:12,389 --> 00:08:15,740
Aiden, look at her.

103
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:16,740
Look at her.

104
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,740
She's all dressed up for what?

105
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:26,269
What was that?

106
00:08:26,269 --> 00:08:28,269
Oh my God, is she pregnant already?

107
00:08:28,269 --> 00:08:39,039
That's enough.

108
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,039
Look at her.

109
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:42,039
She's all dressed up for what?

110
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:45,039
You sold yourself to some ritual fraud.

111
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:46,039
I told you.

112
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:48,039
College is a waste of time.

113
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:49,039
Pregnant horse.

114
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:56,669
I'm coming in.

115
00:08:56,669 --> 00:09:13,000
What's going on?

116
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I have three assignments due next month.

117
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,700
I'm just tired.

118
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,700
You're lying.

119
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,980
I take a break.

120
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:21,980
No, I can't.

121
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,980
I can't afford to take a break.

122
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:27,980
I need to graduate so I can get away from my family.

123
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,980
Look, you're pregnant.

124
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:30,980
And this is only...

125
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:33,980
Yeah, I did this to myself.

126
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:39,850
You're not alone in this.

127
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:44,500
I'll support you whatever you do.

128
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:49,659
Please promise me I'll take care of yourself, okay?

129
00:09:49,659 --> 00:10:03,500
See you at dinner.

130
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,659
Follow her.

131
00:10:04,659 --> 00:10:08,659
I want to know everyone she talks to and everything she does on campus.

132
00:10:08,659 --> 00:10:31,860
Select.

133
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,860
See, you're into an old man, right?

134
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,860
How much does he pay you?

135
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:36,860
Does he even pay you?

136
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,860
But do you sleep with him for free?

137
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:41,860
What's a leg sleeping with a fat old frog?

138
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:43,860
Can he even get hard?

139
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:44,860
You just let me go.

140
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,860
Not so fast, slut.

141
00:10:50,379 --> 00:11:12,919
Ella, are you okay?

142
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:15,389
What happened?

143
00:11:15,389 --> 00:11:17,389
Did Sabrina give you a hard time again?

144
00:11:17,389 --> 00:11:18,389
I'll talk to the dean.

145
00:11:18,389 --> 00:11:19,389
No, it's Hayden.

146
00:11:19,389 --> 00:11:20,389
It's okay.

147
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:21,419
I'm okay.

148
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:22,419
Are you sure?

149
00:11:22,419 --> 00:11:23,419
You don't look okay.

150
00:11:23,419 --> 00:11:34,169
Okay, so I'll see you tomorrow.

151
00:11:34,169 --> 00:11:35,169
Yeah, I'll see you.

152
00:11:35,169 --> 00:11:38,539
Who's that guy?

153
00:11:38,539 --> 00:12:00,570
Seatbelt.

154
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:05,919
Let's go.

155
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:09,070
Did I do something wrong?

156
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:11,899
Am I jealous?

157
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:30,889
What's wrong?

158
00:12:30,889 --> 00:12:32,820
That's nothing.

159
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:43,330
Think I'm going to take a break from college?

160
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:45,100
What?

161
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:48,100
I thought you didn't want to.

162
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:52,330
What's this?

163
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:55,580
It's nothing.

164
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,580
I'm just tired all the time.

165
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,580
I can't keep up with my schoolwork anymore.

166
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,580
You don't trust me.

167
00:13:03,429 --> 00:13:04,779
Fine.

168
00:13:04,779 --> 00:13:05,779
Take a break if you need to,

169
00:13:05,779 --> 00:13:09,360
but from now on, call me Sabrina.

170
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,919
Sabrina.

171
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:17,460
No one has ever treated me like this.

172
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:19,460
I should trust him.

173
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:29,129
Connor, I need a full report of what happened on campus today.

174
00:13:29,129 --> 00:13:41,169
You got it.

175
00:13:41,169 --> 00:13:44,169
Sir, I prepared some essential oils for Mrs. Harrington.

176
00:13:44,169 --> 00:13:46,169
Which do you think she'd prefer?

177
00:13:46,169 --> 00:13:48,169
Essential oils for what?

178
00:13:48,169 --> 00:13:49,169
For stretch marks, sir.

179
00:13:49,169 --> 00:13:52,169
They don't always work, but it's best to be prepared.

180
00:13:53,169 --> 00:13:55,169
It goes on the...

181
00:13:55,169 --> 00:13:56,169
On the belly, sir.

182
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:59,539
And the back of the thighs as well.

183
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:00,539
I'll take them down.

184
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:01,539
Of course, sir.

185
00:14:01,539 --> 00:14:27,970
Would you like me to show you how to apply them?

186
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:29,970
So, which one do you prefer?

187
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:33,970
We have sea salt, lavender, and rose.

188
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:40,169
Essential oils to prevent stretch marks.

189
00:14:40,169 --> 00:14:48,419
They consider it lavender sounds nice.

190
00:14:48,419 --> 00:14:49,830
Light down?

191
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:52,500
No.

192
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,039
Not myself, you don't have to.

193
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:55,039
Do you know how?

194
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:58,190
You just rub it in, right?

195
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:01,730
It's a little more complicated.

196
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:06,149
Be good and light up.

197
00:15:06,149 --> 00:15:46,220
Just relax.

198
00:15:46,220 --> 00:16:01,340
I need to get your thighs, too.

199
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:09,519
There's nothing there I haven't seen before.

200
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,519
Okay, with stretch marks.

201
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:48,759
Let me know if you need anything else.

202
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:49,759
Babies.

203
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,759
This is just about the babies.

204
00:16:52,759 --> 00:17:22,180
Are you okay?

205
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,180
What happened?

206
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,180
I just dropped my phone.

207
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:28,759
I'm fine.

208
00:17:28,759 --> 00:17:39,660
Sorry I asked to take this.

209
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:40,660
Don't, mommy.

210
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:43,170
Did you hook up with some rich old dirt?

211
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:44,170
No, I didn't.

212
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:45,230
Don't lie to me.

213
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:49,259
Mommy, please, I didn't.

214
00:17:49,259 --> 00:17:52,259
I don't care who's bed you crawled into.

215
00:17:52,259 --> 00:17:53,259
Where are you?

216
00:17:53,259 --> 00:17:59,400
You think you can just run off like that who raised you?

217
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:05,500
I want my money back, Ella.

218
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,589
Every penny I spent on you.

219
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:09,589
How much?

220
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:14,819
I don't have that kind of money.

221
00:18:14,819 --> 00:18:20,450
Or I'll find you ruined everything.

222
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:46,660
Sam, Ella's been blown up and you need to see what's blown up on the internet right now.

223
00:18:46,660 --> 00:19:05,940
What did your mom say?

224
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:28,319
I should tell her once.

225
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:35,279
Being horrible to me on campus.

226
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:37,279
You're spreading lies about me online.

227
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:39,279
I'm glad you told me.

228
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:40,630
I can help.

229
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:47,980
Because I want you to be the real Mrs. Harrington.

230
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:56,190
The real Mrs. Harrington should be someone you love.

231
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:59,380
You will be a great Mrs. Harrington.

232
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:05,099
I'm no match to your family or your status.

233
00:20:05,099 --> 00:20:06,359
Yes.

234
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:14,089
Is there something on my face?

235
00:20:14,089 --> 00:20:15,500
No.

236
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,269
Does this change?

237
00:20:18,269 --> 00:20:19,369
It changed for the better.

238
00:20:19,369 --> 00:20:30,039
You've changed me.

239
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:31,039
Did anyone see you?

240
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:32,259
I hope not.

241
00:20:32,259 --> 00:20:36,690
Ms. Harrington.

242
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:37,690
Come here, Ella.

243
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:41,059
Do you need me for?

244
00:20:41,059 --> 00:20:43,059
I want to make a statement with your old friends.

245
00:20:43,059 --> 00:20:44,059
Care to join us?

246
00:20:44,059 --> 00:20:46,059
My old friends?

247
00:20:46,059 --> 00:20:49,059
Yeah, it'll be worth your time.

248
00:20:49,059 --> 00:21:10,349
Ella, if at any point you feel uncomfortable, let me know, okay?

249
00:21:10,349 --> 00:21:37,730
We can leave, Ella.

250
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:39,950
Sam, what is this?

251
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:46,369
A lesson for anyone who dares to mess with my wife.

252
00:21:46,369 --> 00:21:49,579
I'm not done yet.

253
00:21:49,579 --> 00:21:52,470
We have one more guest.

254
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:56,259
This is letting go.

255
00:21:56,259 --> 00:21:57,259
Calm down.

256
00:21:57,259 --> 00:22:15,579
Ella, will these men with you?

257
00:22:15,579 --> 00:22:18,819
Or?

258
00:22:18,819 --> 00:22:22,690
Mind your tone when you speak to Ms. Harrington.

259
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:24,690
Oh, now I see.

260
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:28,069
You're the one paying your bills.

261
00:22:28,069 --> 00:22:30,069
Now I can make this really simple for you.

262
00:22:30,069 --> 00:22:32,299
You give me the cash.

263
00:22:32,299 --> 00:22:36,339
Ella isn't for sale.

264
00:22:36,339 --> 00:22:37,380
No.

265
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:42,690
No, my design isn't she, uh, pregnant?

266
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:47,220
Sam, let them go.

267
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:48,759
Are you sure?

268
00:22:48,759 --> 00:23:01,420
Don't she forget.

269
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,420
I am your mother.

270
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,420
Oh!

271
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:15,220
I've never heard a mother talk about her daughter like that.

272
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:20,670
Is she really your birth mother?

273
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:21,670
I'll look into it.

274
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:25,819
Under one condition.

275
00:23:25,819 --> 00:23:28,390
What's the condition?

276
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:29,390
You move into my bedroom.

277
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:31,869
It'll be our bedroom.

278
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:34,670
I have my own room.

279
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:39,440
But don't you think a Mr. and Mrs. shouldn't be in separate beds?

280
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,200
We'll share a bed just to sleep in.

281
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:48,099
Come on, let's go.

282
00:23:48,099 --> 00:24:31,250
Heard you dropped out.

283
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:34,069
What?

284
00:24:34,069 --> 00:24:35,069
Complicated.

285
00:24:35,069 --> 00:24:36,069
Can we meet up today?

286
00:24:36,069 --> 00:24:38,670
Yeah.

287
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:48,180
Hey.

288
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:50,460
How are you doing?

289
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:51,460
I'm good.

290
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,460
How are you?

291
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:53,460
Good.

292
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:55,980
I didn't know you're married.

293
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,980
Engaged, I guess.

294
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:05,509
Ella, are you okay?

295
00:25:05,509 --> 00:25:07,700
Is he a good person?

296
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,700
There's some rumors about him that have been flying around.

297
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:10,769
Yeah.

298
00:25:10,769 --> 00:25:11,769
He's a good person.

299
00:25:11,769 --> 00:25:13,769
He treats me very well.

300
00:25:13,769 --> 00:25:18,579
That's good to know.

301
00:25:18,579 --> 00:25:20,579
You're still failing that science class?

302
00:25:20,579 --> 00:25:21,579
Yeah.

303
00:25:21,579 --> 00:25:25,660
Same guy.

304
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:26,910
Makes sense.

305
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:31,069
He's a reagent when you're getting old.
