1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Victoria.

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.200
When did you get back from Spain or Italy or whatever?

3
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.000
Spain and I got back last week.

4
00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.580
We should catch up sometime.

5
00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.580
Book a meeting with Connor.

6
00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:17.019
I don't need a meeting.

7
00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:24.780
You're married?

8
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.679
What?

9
00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:28.679
None of your business.

10
00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:32.679
But we've known each other since we're three. We're a perfect match.

11
00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:34.679
No, we're not.

12
00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:38.219
Ella and I are a perfect match.

13
00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.219
Ella?

14
00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:41.859
Seb.

15
00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:45.359
Ella.

16
00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:47.359
Let's get you home, Seb.
