1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,319
Have you...

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:03,319
I've seen.

3
00:00:03,319 --> 00:00:07,120
Is she... am I?

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:13,859
You need to see for yourself.

5
00:00:13,859 --> 00:00:14,859
Be brave.

6
00:00:14,859 --> 00:00:27,500
Ella?

7
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,980
Talk to me.

8
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,280
Really?

9
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,280
That she's not my real mother.

10
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:41,600
But still.

11
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,600
About them.

12
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,859
What about them?

13
00:00:43,859 --> 00:00:47,840
They died in a car crash.

14
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,840
The day that Deborah took you.

15
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:56,469
Ella!

16
00:00:56,469 --> 00:00:58,689
Ella!
