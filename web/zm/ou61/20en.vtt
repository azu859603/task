00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.799
They're not worth it, baby.

2
00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:13.320
I'll make sure they both stay in prison.

3
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.379
Deborah and Dylan Reed, you're under arrest for human trafficking and kidnapping.

4
00:00:18.379 --> 00:00:27.649
I have no family left.

5
00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:32.409
You have me. You have our babies.

6
00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:34.920
We'll be a family.

7
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:52.670
Weeks! You shouldn't be doing that!

8
00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.670
Eliza, I'm fine.

9
00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.670
What do you like to travel on?

10
00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:58.670
Sure.

11
00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:09.469
Oh my God.

12
00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:10.469
I'm just a bastion.

13
00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:12.469
Oh, I was just going to see you.

14
00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:14.469
Good. That's lovely.

15
00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:16.469
They're really good.

16
00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:21.819
Seth?
