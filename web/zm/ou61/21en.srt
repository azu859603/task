1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,120
Um, who are you?

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,400
Seb doesn't like other people.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,160
Oh, don't worry.

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,199
He won't mind, trust me.

5
00:00:08,199 --> 00:00:11,570
We've known each other since we were three.

6
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:13,150
I'm Victoria.

7
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:18,699
Seb's best friend.

8
00:00:18,699 --> 00:00:21,850
I was supposed to marry him, you know?

9
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:27,820
My family's business partners with the Harrington's.

10
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:31,309
I didn't know that.

11
00:00:31,309 --> 00:00:35,420
I know you're pregnant.

12
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:37,479
Leave him after you give birth.

13
00:00:39,859 --> 00:00:41,780
I'm all treats to twins as my own.

14
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:47,890
What?

15
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:49,250
You heard me.

16
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:50,630
No.

17
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:53,990
If you were supposed to marry him, then why didn't you?

18
00:00:53,990 --> 00:01:02,100
Because you knew he didn't want you.

19
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,060
What happened?

20
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:07,579
If anything happens to her, you'll pay.
