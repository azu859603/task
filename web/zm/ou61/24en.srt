1
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:16,469
There are so many people saying nice things.

2
00:00:16,469 --> 00:00:21,600
As they should, and there'll be even more at the baby shower.

3
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,460
Isn't that supposed to happen before the babies are born?

4
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:29,530
Well, well, when you're a hareter, you make the rules.

5
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,530
In that case, can I plan the baby shower?

6
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:35,530
Of course. I'll support you whatever you do.

7
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:59,539
What about this one, Mrs. Harrington? I feel like Fuchsia is like really in right now.

8
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:04,950
I don't know. I like the orange a little bit more.

9
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:07,950
How about cake? I really like this one.

10
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:13,390
I like the dripping. I'm sorry.

11
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:15,390
Just give me one second.

12
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:19,280
Yeah, of course, Mrs. Harrington.

13
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,280
Aiden, hi.

14
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,530
I'll tell you something.
