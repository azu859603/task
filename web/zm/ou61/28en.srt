00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:18,140
Thank you so much for coming, everyone, to celebrate the birth of our two little girls

2
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:20,140
to our family.

3
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:21,140
Oh, Bridget!

4
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:22,140
Oh, God, let's stop.

5
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:36,250
I never thought you'd actually birth two heirs to the Harrington legacy.

6
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:42,429
Ms. Prescott, tell me, what drugs did you use to get him into bed with you?

7
00:00:42,429 --> 00:00:46,020
That's not an appropriate discussion, Ms. Prescott.

8
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,189
Why not?

9
00:00:48,189 --> 00:00:53,429
You are the one that crawled into his bed like a cheap little whore, and you made yourself

10
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:55,429
a container for his babies.

11
00:00:55,429 --> 00:01:02,770
Tell me, how does it feel to know you're just a tool?

12
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:06,170
He'll never really care for you.

13
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:09,209
Well, what does that make you, then?

14
00:01:09,209 --> 00:01:10,980
What?

15
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,379
You've exhausted all your resources.

16
00:01:13,379 --> 00:01:15,340
You won't even look your way.

17
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:18,420
If I'm just a tool, what are you?

18
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,930
You need to leave.

19
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:25,609
Did you know she was seeing another man?
