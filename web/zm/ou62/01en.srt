1
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:06,719
I'm Owen. Owen Russell.

2
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:09,009
Nice to meet you.

3
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:14,179
Nice to meet you too.

4
00:00:14,179 --> 00:00:16,179
I love you forever.

5
00:00:16,179 --> 00:00:17,179
I promise.

6
00:00:17,179 --> 00:00:31,820
I will kill you.

7
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:33,820
Why do I keep dreaming of Owen Russell?

8
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:39,020
What happened between us?

9
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:42,329
Was he my lover?

10
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:46,539
I can't remember anything.

11
00:00:46,539 --> 00:00:51,840
It's been six years since I've lost my memory.

12
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,090
I still keep dreaming about him.

13
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:58,119
So she really is pregnant?

14
00:00:58,119 --> 00:01:00,179
I have to find him.

15
00:01:00,179 --> 00:01:03,659
But today is all about my sister Emma's wedding.

16
00:01:03,659 --> 00:01:05,790
I need to start prepping.
