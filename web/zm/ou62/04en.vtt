00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:13.539
You two are right.

2
00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:14.890
Yeah.

3
00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:27.000
You should just bother me.

4
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.199
But I don't have money.

5
00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.149
I was just too hungry.

6
00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:31.750
Even if we have money,

7
00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.350
you can't just rob people.

8
00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:34.750
Shame on you.

9
00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:48.390
Don't be so stingy, there's a girl.

10
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.789
Just buy another burger.

11
00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:50.990
Even if we have money,

12
00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:52.990
it doesn't give you the right to rob people.

13
00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:54.390
Shame on you.

14
00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.090
Faith to burger.

15
00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.409
Thank you for your help.

16
00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:05.569
I'm on.

17
00:01:05.569 --> 00:01:07.060
I'm on Russell.

18
00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.260
Um...

19
00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.590
Nice to meet you.

20
00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.719
Nice to meet you too.

21
00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:16.719
What's your name?

22
00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:19.000
Erica.

23
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.459
I'm Owen Russell.

24
00:01:23.459 --> 00:01:26.739
Owen Russell?

25
00:01:26.739 --> 00:01:28.739
He's the one from my dreams.

26
00:01:28.739 --> 00:01:32.739
Could he be my lover from before I lost my memory?

27
00:01:32.739 --> 00:01:36.739
But why did he say Adam is his son?

28
00:01:36.739 --> 00:01:39.739
Did he have a relationship with Emma?
