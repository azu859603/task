00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:12,820
I can't read what you ask about Adam.

2
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:14,500
Why did you say he was your son?

3
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,980
I received an anonymous letter last week.

4
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,699
I spent some pictures and evidence saying that Adam was my child, so I've been looking

5
00:00:21,699 --> 00:00:22,699
for him.

6
00:00:22,699 --> 00:00:28,910
But Adam is my sister's child, so did you have a relationship with Emma?

7
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:29,910
Emma?

8
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:35,670
My dear Emma, I've been looking for six years.

9
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:39,880
Have you seen her?

10
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:40,880
Oh, yeah.

11
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:44,820
She's dead.

12
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:48,100
What?

13
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,100
How is that possible?

14
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,329
What happened?

15
00:00:50,329 --> 00:00:52,329
The police told me she was murdered.

16
00:00:52,329 --> 00:00:56,289
They will get back to me if they find anything.

17
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:57,289
Who did this to her?

18
00:00:57,289 --> 00:01:00,829
If I find out who is responsible, I'll kill myself!
