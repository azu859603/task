1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:07,870
If Adam really is Emma and Owen's child, then Emma must have been with Owen the six years

2
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:09,509
she was missing.

3
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:13,580
Why did she agree to marry Dan when she came back?

4
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,100
I was so confusing.

5
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,739
Look at how Owen misses Emma.

6
00:00:19,739 --> 00:00:30,980
There must have been feeling, feeling much and well, I was really handsome.

7
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:35,460
He's Emma's man, my brother-in-law.

8
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,859
I can't like him.

9
00:00:39,859 --> 00:00:44,920
Why does he keep appearing in my dreams?

10
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,810
When I was sorry, Srinny, I was lost in my thought.

11
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:51,219
How on her bite?

12
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:53,880
I'm sure I don't want to eat.

13
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:58,100
What's up, dad?

14
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,619
Can't you eat sweet tea tree?

15
00:01:00,619 --> 00:01:02,420
Of course you can.

16
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,390
Can we have some juice?

17
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:08,379
Stop asking so much.

18
00:01:08,379 --> 00:01:10,980
Did I say something wrong?

19
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:16,480
Well, definitely not.

20
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,079
Wait for me, sweetie.

21
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:27,090
I'll get you some juice.

22
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:30,750
I feel like I've been here before.

23
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:36,140
Remember.

24
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:39,340
So you're the bitch, Owen Bortbeck.

25
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,739
Watch me how I handle you.
