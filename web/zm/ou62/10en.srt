1
00:00:03,339 --> 00:00:10,390
You must be Erika. How are you here? You're supposed to be dead.

2
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:14,099
I am going to forgive that.

3
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:16,100
You might have known my sister Emma.

4
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,350
She did pass away.

5
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:22,120
Oh, I see.

6
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,120
You do look a lot like her.

7
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,120
Nice to meet you. I'm Freya.

8
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,300
Nice to meet you.

9
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,299
Oh and I grew up here together.

10
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:36,299
So I know every inch of this estate.

11
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:39,299
I see you're looking for something.

12
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:40,299
Can I help you with anything?

13
00:00:40,299 --> 00:00:41,299
Yes.

14
00:00:41,299 --> 00:00:45,299
I was trying to get some ingredients for a juice.

15
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:46,299
Oh.

16
00:00:46,299 --> 00:00:47,299
First flower petals?

17
00:00:47,299 --> 00:00:49,299
Oh! Flowers.

18
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:57,219
Fill me.

19
00:00:57,219 --> 00:01:00,369
Perfect.

20
00:01:00,369 --> 00:01:10,209
These flowers are beautiful.

21
00:01:10,209 --> 00:01:14,209
Pick that flower and just wait for Owen to beat you to death.
