1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.429
I made some sweet juice for Adam.

2
00:00:05.429 --> 00:00:11.179
Made one for you to try it.

3
00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:20.809
Amber used to make something just like this.

4
00:00:20.809 --> 00:00:25.809
I've had so many Michelin star chefs try to replicate it, but none of them could.

5
00:00:25.809 --> 00:00:28.420
How did you do it?

6
00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.829
My sister hated sweet things.

7
00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:33.829
Why would she make juice for Owen?

8
00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:35.829
Was her secret ingredient?

9
00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:39.850
What did you add?

10
00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:46.490
I added apples, oranges, plums, and fresh rose petals.

11
00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.869
Rose petals? Yes, yes, yes, that's it.

12
00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:57.950
What did you say you got the roses from?

13
00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.740
I'm going back here.

14
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.740
There's just one rose bush there.

15
00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.739
We lose its time.

16
00:01:05.739 --> 00:01:10.400
I planted that rose bush.

17
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.400
How dare you pick it with all my permission!

18
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.400
You won't die!

19
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:20.390
I had took me to that bush.

20
00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:21.390
These are just black!

21
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.560
They bloomed, they whither.

22
00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.560
Why not put them to a better use?

23
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.560
Amber said that.

24
00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.230
You and her are saying the same things.

25
00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.030
Who are you?

26
00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:53.700
We'll fight with someone.

27
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.700
It's Owen.

28
00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.420
His temper is unpredictable like a madman.

29
00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.620
He hurt you.

30
00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.709
He's scary.

31
00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:04.709
Sweetie.

32
00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:08.870
Don't you ever grow up to be an erratic man like him?

33
00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:10.000
Okay.

34
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.900
Okay, well, Erica.

35
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.900
And stay away from him.

36
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.879
Your face changes.

37
00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:20.909
Sometimes pale, sometimes red.

38
00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:23.909
My face turns red when I see him.

39
00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:41.169
Owen not only looks familiar, but also makes me blush.

40
00:02:41.169 --> 00:02:43.169
He's too temperamental.

41
00:02:43.169 --> 00:02:46.169
Interchanging between being gentle and violent.

42
00:02:46.169 --> 00:02:48.169
He's too dangerous.

43
00:02:48.169 --> 00:03:00.419
And most gentle so doesn't deserve a guy like him.

44
00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:03.900
Why does she say the exact same thing as Emma used to?

45
00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.939
And why does she feel so familiar?

46
00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:09.449
Just because she's Emma's sister.

47
00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:11.449
Or could she be the Emma I'm looking for?

48
00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:16.099
I'm thinking.

49
00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:20.099
If she really were Emma, why wouldn't she recognize me and hide her identity?

50
00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:25.080
Don't be sorry.

51
00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.080
Puss, there's something wrong without him.

52
00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.080
What happened?

53
00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:39.139
What happened?

54
00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:42.139
He came into the room and he was looking for you.

55
00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:46.580
Then he said he was hurting his stomach or something.

56
00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.580
Is that okay that we're here?

57
00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:49.580
Yeah, that's fine.

58
00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.580
I've been found Dr. Reed.

59
00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.580
He's going to come here so no support at all.

60
00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.580
It's going to take you two to three days at the Alice.

61
00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:56.580
Two to three days.

62
00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.860
He has high fever.

63
00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.860
Go find a doctor from the nearest hospital.

64
00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:02.860
Yes, he is.

65
00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:08.500
Now.

66
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:09.500
He's getting so serious.

67
00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.500
He has acute gastroenteritis from consuming too much cold food.

68
00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:14.500
A guy is screaming.

69
00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.500
And now he has a high fever.

70
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:17.500
He needs close monitoring.

71
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:26.860
I didn't stop him in time.

72
00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.410
I can't trust you with a child.

73
00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:30.410
Go.

74
00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:31.410
I'll take care of her myself.

75
00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.839
No, I don't want Mama Eric.

76
00:04:35.839 --> 00:04:36.839
Totally.

77
00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:40.839
She wasn't the one who gave me hope of the ice cream.

78
00:04:40.839 --> 00:04:44.839
It was a lady named Freya.

79
00:04:44.839 --> 00:04:45.839
I heard them.

80
00:04:45.839 --> 00:04:49.839
They say that she gave me so much.

81
00:04:49.839 --> 00:04:50.839
I'm sorry.

82
00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:53.829
I hate to unlock.

83
00:04:53.829 --> 00:04:54.829
Go get Freya, forget.

84
00:04:54.829 --> 00:04:57.149
I didn't even know she was back.

85
00:04:57.149 --> 00:05:03.529
I miss you so much.

86
00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:05.529
How could you give him so much ice cream?

87
00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:06.529
Huh?

88
00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:09.259
Because he's your child after all.

89
00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:11.259
I'll give him whatever he wants.

90
00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:12.259
You don't have to worry.

91
00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:15.259
He just has a little bit of stomach pain.

92
00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:17.259
But you know, kids will get better really soon.

93
00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:23.620
I was willing to forgive you for what you did to me in the garden.

94
00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.620
But this is too much.

95
00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.620
Don't you understand?

96
00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:28.620
Karma's coming for you.

97
00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.620
How could you do something like that?

98
00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:32.620
What has he ever done to you?

99
00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:36.490
I just wanted to spoil him a little bit because it's your son.

100
00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.490
I didn't think he was going to make him sick.

101
00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.490
I've never looked after a child.

102
00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:46.939
I didn't know.

103
00:05:46.939 --> 00:05:48.939
You are an adult.

104
00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:51.939
You didn't know that feeding too much ice cream to a kid would make him sick.

105
00:05:51.939 --> 00:05:52.939
What have you done?

106
00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:54.939
What's your mouth, bitch?

107
00:05:54.939 --> 00:05:56.939
I bet you're not even mad about the kid.

108
00:05:56.939 --> 00:05:57.939
You mad?

109
00:05:57.939 --> 00:06:01.360
You guys have stuck different things in your flowers in the garden today.

110
00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.360
You'll be trying to seduce Owen.

111
00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:09.360
And now because I'm ruining your plan, you're trying to humiliate me and slander me.

112
00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.939
You're adressing the truth.

113
00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:16.379
We grew up together.

114
00:06:16.379 --> 00:06:18.110
I kind of slipped after you.

115
00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:21.110
Since you were born, I've been here for 20 years.

116
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:23.110
You have to trust me.

117
00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:26.689
First you do this.

118
00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:28.689
And then you turn to daddy for help.

119
00:06:28.689 --> 00:06:31.689
I'm not even planning this in the garden.

120
00:06:31.689 --> 00:06:34.689
This is Owen's own child.

121
00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:37.689
He is suffering because of you.

122
00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:41.740
I feel your fault.

123
00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:50.860
See my ice cream and she wouldn't stop me.

124
00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:51.860
So this is her fault.

125
00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:53.860
That's enough.

126
00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:55.920
Adam needs to rest.

127
00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.300
Freya, you're in the wrong ear.

128
00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:00.300
You're going to apologize to Adam.

129
00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:02.300
And then you're going to cover the medical expenses.

130
00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:06.300
In Erica, you're going to be responsible for beating now on.

131
00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.420
I'm sorry, Adam.

132
00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:10.420
Aren't you afraid it?

133
00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:12.420
It's all her fault.

134
00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:13.420
I did.

135
00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:16.319
I would spoil you like that anymore.

136
00:07:16.319 --> 00:07:25.829
From Adam.

137
00:07:25.829 --> 00:07:29.220
If I see you near him, I will tear you apart.

138
00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:35.120
Where are you laughing at?

139
00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:46.120
Well, aren't you a beast at protecting now unless you have practically rose?

140
00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:52.699
This is what I expected from them as sister.

141
00:07:52.699 --> 00:07:54.699
Fiesty as she was.

142
00:07:54.699 --> 00:08:00.170
Emma was the gentlest person in the world.

143
00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:02.170
She would have cried from that.

144
00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:07.379
Are we talking about the same Emma here?

145
00:08:07.379 --> 00:08:12.329
I feel really guilty for not taking good care of him.

146
00:08:12.329 --> 00:08:13.329
Emma, I'm so sorry.

147
00:08:13.329 --> 00:08:16.839
Well, you couldn't have been looking after him constantly.

148
00:08:16.839 --> 00:08:27.399
When we look after him together, maybe he'll recover faster.

149
00:08:27.399 --> 00:08:33.190
Dear you bastards, you merely hate me like this.

150
00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:37.690
I'm going to make you pay.

151
00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:50.129
Don't come to the mansion as soon as possible.

152
00:08:50.129 --> 00:08:52.159
I want them dead.

153
00:08:52.159 --> 00:09:30.159
Morning sugar, Emma.

154
00:09:30.159 --> 00:09:31.159
Yes, it's me.

155
00:09:31.159 --> 00:09:36.460
I haven't heard you call me that for so long.

156
00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:51.899
I miss you so much.

157
00:09:51.899 --> 00:09:52.899
Get the doctor.

158
00:09:52.899 --> 00:09:55.059
I'll see you about some breakfast.

159
00:09:55.059 --> 00:10:08.230
The kiss.

160
00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:11.230
What am I dreaming about?

161
00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:14.230
His heart and eyes are full of Emma.

162
00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:26.990
I don't want to be jealous of my sister.

163
00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:27.990
For that kiss.

164
00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:30.179
It feels a lot like Emma.

165
00:10:30.179 --> 00:10:33.590
Morning sugar, Owen.

166
00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:40.879
But why did you call me sugar, Owen?

167
00:10:40.879 --> 00:10:43.879
That's a secret name between me and Emma.

168
00:10:43.879 --> 00:10:48.570
I need to test her a bit more.

169
00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:54.299
Why, you're here?

170
00:10:54.299 --> 00:10:56.299
How did you come back?

171
00:10:56.299 --> 00:11:01.659
Sorry.

172
00:11:01.659 --> 00:11:03.730
I finally found you.

173
00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:04.730
I was wrong.

174
00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:06.730
I want for you to take your medicine.

175
00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:08.820
Please, don't disappear like that again.

176
00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:09.820
You scared me.

177
00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:12.820
Well, maybe if you invite Miss Emma.

178
00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:14.820
My savior.

179
00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:17.860
Back to the villa it might motivate me to take my medicine.

180
00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:20.690
Don't do that.

181
00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:23.460
You injure yourself.

182
00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:26.950
I'm not here.

183
00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:28.909
I'll be here.

184
00:11:28.909 --> 00:11:29.909
What do you mean?

185
00:11:29.909 --> 00:11:30.909
I'm not working.

186
00:11:30.909 --> 00:11:40.940
So she really is pregnant?

187
00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:42.580
Yes, sorry.

188
00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:49.379
It's too early for that.

189
00:11:49.379 --> 00:11:52.629
It hasn't abandoned us.

190
00:11:52.629 --> 00:11:57.860
I promise that I will do everything I can

191
00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:00.860
so that I'll be able to witness the birth of our child myself.

192
00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:09.230
I'm not supposed to be here.

193
00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:25.169
Oh, and Russell inform you that I have discovered your true identity.

194
00:12:25.169 --> 00:12:30.200
You are nothing but a low-life skank who tries to bind me with a child.

195
00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:32.200
I won't let you keep this child.

196
00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:35.929
What is this?

197
00:12:35.929 --> 00:12:36.929
What is this?

198
00:12:36.929 --> 00:12:37.929
Hey!

199
00:12:37.929 --> 00:12:46.009
Drink it and I have nothing to do with the rest of you.

200
00:12:46.009 --> 00:12:53.059
No!

201
00:12:53.059 --> 00:12:56.059
He has plenty of women that can bear his children.

202
00:12:56.059 --> 00:13:00.970
And they're from high.

203
00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:02.970
You think you're so important for him?

204
00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:05.159
Why he would let you here?

205
00:13:05.159 --> 00:13:12.620
I'm pregnant.

206
00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:16.009
Who's that possible? Who's the father?

207
00:13:16.009 --> 00:13:18.009
My baby doesn't have a father.

208
00:13:18.009 --> 00:13:19.009
We're not enough for him.

209
00:13:19.009 --> 00:13:22.009
Will you help me find a place to stay? I want to keep it.

210
00:13:22.009 --> 00:13:23.139
Of course.

211
00:13:23.139 --> 00:13:24.419
Definitely help you.

212
00:13:24.419 --> 00:13:28.490
Just like before when you helped me when we exchanged identities.

213
00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:35.009
Why did I switch identities with you?

214
00:13:35.009 --> 00:13:41.100
Why did I switch identities with you?

215
00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:43.100
Switch identities?

216
00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:44.100
What does that mean?

217
00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:46.169
Could it be?

218
00:13:46.169 --> 00:13:50.019
Nobody can help me but you.

219
00:13:50.019 --> 00:13:51.019
I love him.

220
00:13:51.019 --> 00:13:53.019
I love Dan Erika.

221
00:13:53.019 --> 00:13:56.019
And without this love I wouldn't have made it until now.

222
00:13:56.019 --> 00:13:58.019
But won't the truth come out soon?

223
00:13:58.019 --> 00:14:00.019
Emma, we can't deceive people like this.

224
00:14:00.019 --> 00:14:02.019
It won't be long.

225
00:14:02.019 --> 00:14:04.279
Just give me some time.

226
00:14:04.279 --> 00:14:06.379
I will leave the city with him.

227
00:14:06.379 --> 00:14:08.570
And I will make him fall in love with me.

228
00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:09.570
And he is familiar.

229
00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:12.570
He just wanted you to marry him because you're more healthy than me

230
00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:14.570
and capable of marrying children.

231
00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:15.570
But you don't love him.

232
00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:17.860
So it's better for both of us.

233
00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:32.149
He does fall in love with you and the truth.

234
00:14:32.149 --> 00:14:35.019
Thank you.

235
00:14:35.019 --> 00:14:36.590
Thank you Erika.

236
00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:37.590
From now on.

237
00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:49.289
From Owen's Emma.

238
00:14:49.289 --> 00:14:53.769
The one he's been looking for all this time was me.

239
00:14:53.769 --> 00:14:56.250
You devil!

240
00:14:56.250 --> 00:14:59.250
You are the one who wanted to kill my child.

241
00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:01.250
I will not let you get away with this.

242
00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:02.250
I will tell.

243
00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:10.620
To do that to you.

244
00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:13.620
Without Mitter Russell's consent.

245
00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:15.320
What?

246
00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:18.379
You were just this past time when he was sick.

247
00:15:18.379 --> 00:15:24.379
Otherwise, why he didn't bring you with him when he went to his eyes treatment.

248
00:15:24.379 --> 00:15:27.379
He was going to inherit the family's fortune.

249
00:15:27.379 --> 00:15:31.379
And then he became a stain in his life.

250
00:15:31.379 --> 00:15:35.379
That's why he had to get rid of you and aid him.

251
00:15:35.379 --> 00:15:37.379
His illegitimate bastard.

252
00:15:37.379 --> 00:15:39.379
That's impossible.

253
00:15:39.379 --> 00:15:41.450
He's amazing.

254
00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:42.450
He's looking for me.

255
00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:43.450
He loves me.

256
00:15:43.450 --> 00:15:45.610
If he loves you.

257
00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:54.330
How come he couldn't recognize you after spending so many days with you.

258
00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:57.330
He still doesn't know that you are Emma.

259
00:15:57.330 --> 00:16:04.649
If he finds out you know what will happen to the woman who only brought stain in his life.

260
00:16:04.649 --> 00:16:07.539
You know better than me.

261
00:16:07.539 --> 00:16:14.370
Do you want to stay in this cold and dark basement forever?

262
00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:15.370
Back then.

263
00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:18.370
You know it with thanks to me if you could escape.

264
00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:33.950
So I advise you to go out right now.

265
00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:45.139
Nothing more about your child.

266
00:16:45.139 --> 00:16:46.679
Oh my dear Adam.

267
00:16:46.679 --> 00:16:47.679
Oh my son.

268
00:16:47.679 --> 00:16:48.679
I am so sorry.

269
00:16:48.679 --> 00:16:50.679
I haven't been with you this whole time.

270
00:16:50.679 --> 00:17:02.889
Where are you taking my child, Erica?

271
00:17:02.889 --> 00:17:05.890
Just help me one more time.

272
00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:09.890
I need a child to make dense family back into a marriage.

273
00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:11.890
So I can be my status.

274
00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:15.890
Besides, the father of the child he doesn't owe anymore or him.

275
00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:20.160
That's just important to me.

276
00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:26.799
The good care of him.

277
00:17:26.799 --> 00:17:27.799
Kevin.

278
00:17:27.799 --> 00:17:29.089
Hold on to this.

279
00:17:29.089 --> 00:17:30.089
We miss him.

280
00:17:30.089 --> 00:17:34.069
Let me back my son.

281
00:17:34.069 --> 00:17:48.670
His son.

282
00:17:48.670 --> 00:18:02.420
This has to be our secret.

283
00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:03.420
What's wrong?

284
00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:08.059
Nothing.

285
00:18:08.059 --> 00:18:10.059
I was just thinking of Emma.

286
00:18:10.059 --> 00:18:13.059
I didn't take good care of the kid and that's sick.

287
00:18:13.059 --> 00:18:15.119
Don't worry.

288
00:18:15.119 --> 00:18:17.119
I'll take good care of Adam.

289
00:18:17.119 --> 00:18:18.119
I owe him about much.

290
00:18:18.119 --> 00:18:19.119
Oh?

291
00:18:19.119 --> 00:18:21.920
I did a lot of things wrong back then.

292
00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:22.920
I heard her deeply.

293
00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:24.920
It wasn't until I turned.

294
00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:26.920
I realized how much I missed her.

295
00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:36.940
To do that to you without Mr. Russell's consent.

296
00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:39.940
So, you never loved me?

297
00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:41.769
Enough.

298
00:18:41.769 --> 00:18:45.990
Adam is better now, so I will take him back to his room.

299
00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:47.119
Let's go.

300
00:18:47.119 --> 00:18:48.119
I also need some rest.

301
00:18:48.119 --> 00:18:49.119
All right.

302
00:18:49.119 --> 00:18:50.119
You two rest well.

303
00:18:50.119 --> 00:18:52.119
Come see you later this evening.

304
00:18:52.119 --> 00:18:55.660
You shouldn't be staying up late, Mr. Owen.

305
00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:59.140
I finally found my son.

306
00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:00.140
He hasn't been feeling well.

307
00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:02.299
I've been looking after him.

308
00:19:02.299 --> 00:19:04.299
I saw the family business run.

309
00:19:04.299 --> 00:19:07.299
Your cornea transplant surgery was rushed.

310
00:19:07.299 --> 00:19:09.299
And the recovery period was too short.

311
00:19:09.299 --> 00:19:13.299
Otherwise, you wouldn't have headaches for staying up late.

312
00:19:13.299 --> 00:19:15.490
And then I arrived too late.

313
00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:19.680
I rushed to surgery just so that I could see my loved one in trial.

314
00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:22.220
I should have taken them with me.

315
00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:25.220
I wouldn't be gone disappearing without a trace.

316
00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:28.119
Mr. Owen?

317
00:19:28.119 --> 00:19:30.339
Look at me.

318
00:19:30.339 --> 00:19:35.779
I have everything except for the one thing I love the most.

319
00:19:35.779 --> 00:19:38.740
How can I make a mess?

320
00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:40.740
Perhaps God is punishing me.

321
00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:43.930
Making me live a lifetime of pain and regret.

322
00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:46.440
I'm sorry, Mr. Owen.

323
00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:49.470
I feel guilty for betraying your trust.

324
00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:53.470
It's all my fault that you are in such pain.

325
00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:55.569
Do you remember Emma?

326
00:19:55.569 --> 00:19:57.569
Erica said that they're sisters.

327
00:19:57.569 --> 00:20:00.849
Do you think they look alike?

328
00:20:00.849 --> 00:20:02.740
Well...

329
00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:04.740
Adam and Ms. Erica have been missing, sir.

330
00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:06.130
What?

331
00:20:06.130 --> 00:20:11.490
You two are lucky.

332
00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:12.490
But don't come back.

333
00:20:12.490 --> 00:20:16.250
We're going to make you bleed.

334
00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:19.299
Adam, be careful, don't make any of this.

335
00:20:19.299 --> 00:20:21.299
We'll be going.

336
00:20:21.299 --> 00:20:26.059
Anyway, as long as it's only for Owen.

337
00:20:26.059 --> 00:20:28.059
I guess you must really hate me.

338
00:20:28.059 --> 00:20:30.509
Why would you run away?

339
00:20:30.509 --> 00:20:32.640
And where are you taking my son?

340
00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:33.640
It's dangerous out there.

341
00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:36.180
Staying here is the same.

342
00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:39.180
I will not let Adam stay with someone like you.

343
00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:44.740
Get away from him.

344
00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:45.960
Leave my son back.

345
00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:51.099
Owen, don't be angry with my brainer.

346
00:20:51.099 --> 00:20:52.099
Hand me the child.

347
00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:58.079
Get your filthy hands off of him.

348
00:20:58.079 --> 00:21:02.079
Already have a woman who deserved white bother with the buster child.

349
00:21:02.079 --> 00:21:03.079
What are you talking about?

350
00:21:03.079 --> 00:21:05.079
Emma's my only wife.

351
00:21:05.079 --> 00:21:07.079
And he's my son, not some bastard child.

352
00:21:07.079 --> 00:21:14.079
How did the master of sweet talk like you lose Emma and Adam for so long, huh?

353
00:21:14.079 --> 00:21:15.079
Alright, that's enough.

354
00:21:15.079 --> 00:21:18.369
Ben, take him to the room and lock the door.

355
00:21:18.369 --> 00:21:20.369
Don't let anyone in without my permission.

356
00:21:20.369 --> 00:21:39.099
Oh, this be...

357
00:21:39.099 --> 00:21:42.099
You already imprisoned me and our child once, Owen.

358
00:21:42.099 --> 00:21:52.049
And now you're doing it again, aren't you?

359
00:21:52.049 --> 00:21:53.049
You have to calm down.

360
00:21:53.049 --> 00:21:54.750
Possible.

361
00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:59.089
Emma, fuck you.

362
00:21:59.089 --> 00:22:00.089
Just died.

363
00:22:00.089 --> 00:22:02.089
I mean, Erica appears.

364
00:22:02.089 --> 00:22:03.089
Erica.

365
00:22:03.089 --> 00:22:05.599
Must be only Emma.

366
00:22:05.599 --> 00:22:06.599
It's impossible.

367
00:22:06.599 --> 00:22:09.240
She's supposed to be dead.

368
00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:10.240
No.

369
00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:13.240
Actually, I couldn't bear it.

370
00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:21.319
My bastard, post me dead.

371
00:22:21.319 --> 00:22:22.509
I'm a doctor.

372
00:22:22.509 --> 00:22:25.509
And doctor can only save lives.

373
00:22:25.509 --> 00:22:26.509
They cannot take them.

374
00:22:26.509 --> 00:22:32.769
I had to lie to Owen, telling him that Emma had been taken by the Russell family.

375
00:22:32.769 --> 00:22:38.900
I hope she will never come.

376
00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:44.960
Lied to Emma, making her believe that everything had been instructed by Owen so that she couldn't

377
00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:45.960
recognize him.

378
00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:46.960
I don't care who she is.

379
00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:49.019
I must have her killed.

380
00:22:49.019 --> 00:22:50.019
Oh, it is mine.

381
00:22:50.019 --> 00:22:52.250
And only mine.

382
00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:57.250
Darling, we are only Owen's family doctors.

383
00:22:57.250 --> 00:23:01.539
Even without Erica, the Russell family will never accept you.

384
00:23:01.539 --> 00:23:03.819
I don't care.

385
00:23:03.819 --> 00:23:17.680
I will never let any other woman by his side.

386
00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:19.740
Mr. Russell wants to see you.

387
00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:20.740
What does he want?

388
00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:22.740
Probably wants to talk about Adam's condition.

389
00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:41.420
Oh, Mr. Owen's most precious belongings.

390
00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:43.420
You, feeling bastard.

391
00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:45.420
Wasn't it taken by Emma?

392
00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:46.420
Why is it here?

393
00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:55.019
Come with me.

394
00:23:55.019 --> 00:23:56.019
My goodness.

395
00:23:56.019 --> 00:23:57.019
How could you?

396
00:23:57.019 --> 00:23:59.019
This is Emma's necklace.

397
00:23:59.019 --> 00:24:00.019
My favorite.

398
00:24:00.019 --> 00:24:02.369
You are truly something for Anne.

399
00:24:02.369 --> 00:24:05.369
You have been here for three seconds and you already know what's missing.

400
00:24:05.369 --> 00:24:06.369
Who stole it?

401
00:24:06.369 --> 00:24:07.369
Head it over.

402
00:24:07.369 --> 00:24:09.869
Daddy, she framed me.

403
00:24:09.869 --> 00:24:13.900
I worked for her finally for ten years.

404
00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:15.900
How could I possibly steal something?

405
00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:17.900
As far as to God, I saw it with my own eyes.

406
00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:20.930
She is the one who stole your belongings.

407
00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:30.589
If you buy his innocence, then strip naked and we'll see.

408
00:24:30.589 --> 00:24:32.589
She's already proven her innocence.

409
00:24:32.589 --> 00:24:33.589
Now it's your turn, Erica.

410
00:24:33.589 --> 00:24:36.589
Are you seriously asking me to strip?

411
00:24:36.589 --> 00:24:39.609
What are you waiting for?

412
00:24:39.609 --> 00:24:40.609
Take a close off.

413
00:24:40.609 --> 00:24:42.930
Don't touch me.

414
00:24:42.930 --> 00:24:44.930
It's all his niggas.

415
00:24:44.930 --> 00:24:48.880
Is this how you show your love?

416
00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:50.880
Are you humiliating me?

417
00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:52.579
Are you getting it?

418
00:24:52.579 --> 00:24:56.690
It's over and they'll stop.

419
00:24:56.690 --> 00:24:57.690
You don't?

420
00:24:57.690 --> 00:25:00.900
Nor do you love?

421
00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:05.160
I'll take it off.

422
00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:11.559
If you knew I was Emma, would you still treat me like this?

423
00:25:11.559 --> 00:25:14.460
I'm sorry, Erica.

424
00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:16.460
Emma left me with almost nothing.

425
00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:19.460
The necklace, I have to get it back.

426
00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:22.900
You are truly something, Mr. Russell.

427
00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:25.160
You didn't cherish Emma.

428
00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:28.160
And now you're using her things to torment her sister.

429
00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:38.039
Open your eyes, Owen.

430
00:25:38.039 --> 00:25:40.039
I don't have the necklace.

431
00:25:40.039 --> 00:25:43.039
But she won't believe what I just found in the front yard.

432
00:25:43.039 --> 00:25:50.500
Get out.

433
00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:51.500
Everybody out.

434
00:25:51.500 --> 00:26:01.250
Why are you doing this?

435
00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:04.910
Why are you doing this?

436
00:26:04.910 --> 00:26:08.579
Don't want other men to see my body?

437
00:26:08.579 --> 00:26:09.579
Why?

438
00:26:09.579 --> 00:26:11.579
You just humiliated me.

439
00:26:11.579 --> 00:26:13.579
And now you want to protect me?

440
00:26:13.579 --> 00:26:15.579
I don't understand, Owen.

441
00:26:15.579 --> 00:26:17.740
I feel like I don't know you.

442
00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:20.740
First you kept kind to me and then you hurt me.

443
00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:23.130
I don't understand your feelings for me.

444
00:26:23.130 --> 00:26:25.130
Who am I to you?

445
00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:27.640
Do you love me?

446
00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:32.240
Or am I just a play toy to you?

447
00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:36.380
Same as back then?

448
00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:39.380
You're a wonderful and beautiful person.

449
00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:42.859
But until I understand the truth of what happened,

450
00:26:42.859 --> 00:26:44.859
my heart belongs to the girl who saved me.

451
00:26:44.859 --> 00:26:45.859
Really?

452
00:26:45.859 --> 00:26:49.180
I will not betray her love.

453
00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:53.390
You may look like her, but you're not her.

454
00:26:53.390 --> 00:26:55.349
You're her sister.

455
00:26:55.349 --> 00:26:59.410
I will respect your love the person I love.

456
00:26:59.410 --> 00:27:01.410
There are no substitutes.

457
00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:04.819
Sister.

458
00:27:04.819 --> 00:27:10.259
So you still haven't recognized me.

459
00:27:10.259 --> 00:27:11.259
Your love?

460
00:27:11.259 --> 00:27:14.019
It's fake.

461
00:27:14.019 --> 00:27:33.900
Owen, pour his heart.

462
00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:36.339
I can't accept this.

463
00:27:36.339 --> 00:27:37.339
I won't.

464
00:27:37.339 --> 00:27:38.599
It's for him.

465
00:27:38.599 --> 00:27:40.599
I think you're too kind.

466
00:27:40.599 --> 00:27:42.599
Not like that low light beach,

467
00:27:42.599 --> 00:27:44.599
who only knows how to seduce men all day long.

468
00:27:44.599 --> 00:27:47.599
If he would also bear Mr. Russell's child,

469
00:27:47.599 --> 00:27:49.599
maybe Mr. Russell would be allowed to you.

470
00:27:49.599 --> 00:27:52.339
I can't fact speak a lot.

471
00:27:52.339 --> 00:27:54.339
The matriarch of the Owen family

472
00:27:54.339 --> 00:27:56.339
cannot resort to such measures.

473
00:27:56.339 --> 00:27:58.339
Is there some surgery real moral part

474
00:27:58.339 --> 00:28:00.339
and they're losing Mr. Russell?

475
00:28:00.339 --> 00:28:04.089
You're right.

476
00:28:04.089 --> 00:28:06.500
Owen can only be mine.

477
00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:09.180
What's the occasion?

478
00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:13.559
It's been a while since we've had a dinner like this together, Owen.

479
00:28:13.559 --> 00:28:15.559
Do you remember?

480
00:28:15.559 --> 00:28:19.069
We used to sit together and eat when we were kids.

481
00:28:19.069 --> 00:28:23.970
I noticed you've been spending a lot of time with Erica recently.

482
00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:26.029
Do you like her?

483
00:28:26.029 --> 00:28:27.160
How could I?

484
00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:33.769
It's so amazing.

485
00:28:33.769 --> 00:28:35.769
Oh, since you're here.

486
00:28:35.769 --> 00:28:38.769
You know, Owen loves listening to the violin.

487
00:28:38.769 --> 00:28:40.769
We hardly have time for a date anymore.

488
00:28:40.769 --> 00:28:43.769
Would you mind lighting the mood and playing some for us?

489
00:28:43.769 --> 00:28:45.769
Don't worry.

490
00:28:45.769 --> 00:28:47.220
I can...

491
00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:52.940
It has been a long time since I've heard ever play.

492
00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:53.940
Can you play?

493
00:28:53.940 --> 00:29:25.240
You know that piece.

494
00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:26.240
I taught you.
