00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:12,080
My birthday is this weekend.

2
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,080
What do you want for your birthday?

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:19,879
The cake from the cafe last time was so delicious.

4
00:00:19,879 --> 00:00:21,879
You can have more of that cake.

5
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:24,140
I'll go buy some later.

6
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,609
Let's go now.

7
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:30,859
You can go together by a big one.

8
00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:32,859
Big cake tastes the best.

9
00:00:32,859 --> 00:00:38,329
What am I going to do with you?

10
00:00:44,189 --> 00:00:46,189
Sir, you're a special guest.

11
00:00:46,189 --> 00:00:48,189
When should I order the cakes for you?

12
00:00:48,189 --> 00:00:49,189
Give me a pen.

13
00:00:49,189 --> 00:00:53,560
Russell Menard?

14
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,560
Well, my last name is Russell.

15
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,560
Sir, you are a special guest.

16
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:01,969
Please take this cake as a gift.

17
00:01:01,969 --> 00:01:05,060
Eric, is it really you?

18
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:08,060
Your father just came to beg me to marry you.

19
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:11,060
And here you are, hooking up with another man.

20
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:16,530
You really ought to be ashamed of yourself.

21
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:18,530
Damn, what are you doing here?

22
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:21,530
You pretend to be so naive and innocent with me.

23
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:25,750
But now, you're so good at producing that.

24
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:29,010
You and your sister, one is infertile

25
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:33,010
and the one who gave birth to the kid is begging to marry me.

26
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:36,010
You two are fucking sluts.

27
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:38,010
That's this big one.

28
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:39,010
Shut up!
