00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240
Who are you? I don't need anyone's help, but you have a pretty face, maybe you come

2
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.910
to sleep with me tonight. What a foul mouth you have. I think you deserve to get beaten

3
00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:18.129
up. That man is not someone you should be messing with. I am waiting for you to kneel

4
00:00:18.129 --> 00:00:24.269
down and beg for my help. Your dreams.

5
00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:32.189
I'm gone. I'm dead.

6
00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:44.140
Come here. The bastard left you his enters. Give it to me now.

7
00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:50.740
You and your sister, one is infertile and the one who gave birth to the kid is

8
00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:57.219
begging to marry me. Who is that man? Why did you say those things?

9
00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:01.299
I want to come down. How can I? Did Emma really spend six years with them?

10
00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:06.260
And he said, which one of you can have children? And who begs to marry him?

11
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:14.560
What does that mean? I don't understand. Owen, I am your Emma. Fine. No more lies.
