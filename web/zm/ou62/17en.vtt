00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.100
Oh, and actually Emma, she's uh...

2
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:04.000
Never mind.

3
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.099
It's my fault for losing her.

4
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.199
Whoever she's with, I shouldn't blame her.

5
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.500
I don't understand why you two got mixed up with it.

6
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:12.800
I'm so special about it.

7
00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.030
Why did you abandon Emma?

8
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.109
I was blind at the time.

9
00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:29.609
Any time there was any news of any corneal transplant breakthrough,

10
00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.809
I would go for the surgery.

11
00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:33.340
I just thought...

12
00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.640
Why didn't you take my sister?

13
00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.780
I regret it.

14
00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.979
There's so much going on at the time.

15
00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:42.179
I wanted to.

16
00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.710
I heard you mention Russell family to that owner today.

17
00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.119
Well, it doesn't know that Russell Manor doesn't deserve to cater for us.

18
00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:52.320
As Reed said,

19
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:59.420
back then not taking me with him was because he thought I wasn't worthy of his status.

20
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:02.939
Is that so?

21
00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:05.140
I've never heard of Russell Manor before.

22
00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.340
I guess I'm worse than that owner, huh?

23
00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.730
I'll go check on Adam.
