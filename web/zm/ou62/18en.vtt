00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.849
I can't sleep. I want to hear the violin. Can you play it for me?

2
00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:08.750
Did your mother spoil you and play the violin to help you sleep?

3
00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:14.400
Mama reads a story. Mama Erica plays the violin.

4
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.399
Emma doesn't play the violin.

5
00:00:16.399 --> 00:00:20.399
Oh, as big as Rebecca's not to play an instrument.

6
00:00:20.399 --> 00:00:22.399
How come I play?

7
00:00:22.399 --> 00:00:28.420
You should leave. I can take care of Adam.

8
00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:29.420
What?

9
00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.420
Your hands have calluses. Emma says also it calluses.

10
00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.420
Oh, what's so weird about that? People who play the violin often have calluses.

11
00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.420
Adam said that Emma doesn't play the violin.

12
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:49.229
Maybe she never played in front of Adam. You should leave.

13
00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:53.740
Stay with Adam tonight.

14
00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:59.030
Is it you? Erica, are you my Emma? I must find out the truth.
