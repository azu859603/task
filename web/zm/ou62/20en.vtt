00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:07.009
Why are you leaving me? Say something. Why are you running away?

2
00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:12.400
Do you even know what happened to me? You never asked anything!

3
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.900
I told you not to run away again.

4
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.399
Who are you to tell me what to do and what not to do?

5
00:00:17.399 --> 00:00:20.960
How could you be so heartless? Abandoned Adam like that?

6
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:26.850
I am heartless! You are the one!

7
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:27.850
What are you talking about?

8
00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:31.850
Six years ago. You abandoned us.

9
00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:33.850
What are you talking about?

10
00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.539
You said you would always love me and be with me.

11
00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:47.079
You said we would plant roses together in the garden.

12
00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:50.079
You said my juice was the most delicious.

13
00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:54.579
You would always recognize me.

14
00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:00.070
When I stood in front of you, you gave me this necklace

15
00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:05.069
and told me that I was the angel who saved you from the darkness.

16
00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:08.599
How could you forget all of that?
