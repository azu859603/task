1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:09,320
Why didn't you tell me you were Emma?

2
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:12,539
Because you heartlessly abandoned me!

3
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:16,250
I never abandoned you! I look for you!

4
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,339
And you disappear!

5
00:00:18,339 --> 00:00:22,949
I lost my memory for six years!

6
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:29,960
How? What happened? Tell me.

7
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,960
You know what? I'm worse off now than I was before.

8
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:43,140
I'm not good enough for you. So just let me know.

9
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:48,520
No. Erica, I will never let you go.

10
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:54,829
Sorry. Emma, Erica, why didn't you tell me who you really are?

11
00:00:54,829 --> 00:00:59,539
I was right in front of you and you didn't recognize me!

12
00:00:59,539 --> 00:01:04,019
I'm sorry. What exactly happened? Where were you taking?

13
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:06,019
Isn't that a question I should be asking you?

14
00:01:06,019 --> 00:01:08,019
That day you went for a checkup.

15
00:01:08,019 --> 00:01:12,019
My family told me that they found suitable corneas and had to operate immediately.

16
00:01:12,019 --> 00:01:18,019
I asked Freya to tell Reed to look after you and I promise them that I will be back right after the surgery.

17
00:01:18,019 --> 00:01:24,049
You asked Reed to look after me? You trusted Reed?
