1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
You trusted Reed?

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,799
Yeah, he's been like a father to me since I was a boy.

3
00:00:05,799 --> 00:00:13,509
Okay, instead of letting him take care of me, why didn't you take me with you?

4
00:00:13,509 --> 00:00:17,469
You were in such a hurry, you didn't have one second to wait for me!

5
00:00:17,469 --> 00:00:22,460
There was no time to book the jet and the only available flight was 20 minutes later.

6
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:26,480
I rushed back as soon as I could to be with you, I swear to God.

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,879
Because of that, my recovery was difficult and now I get headaches every time I stay up late.

8
00:00:31,879 --> 00:00:33,880
Reed has been taking care of me.

9
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:44,619
Reed, give me a breakup letter that said you didn't want me anymore.

10
00:00:44,619 --> 00:00:47,619
He locked me in a basement.

11
00:00:47,619 --> 00:00:50,619
He bit and abused me.

12
00:00:50,619 --> 00:00:55,320
He fed me medications and wanted to abort our child.

13
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,979
What better?

14
00:00:57,979 --> 00:01:01,619
How was that possible?

15
00:01:01,619 --> 00:01:03,619
And he's daughter Freya.

16
00:01:03,619 --> 00:01:05,620
He's been accusing me over and over again.

17
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:07,620
The necklace, now the kidnapping.

18
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:14,299
These people are a family to you.

19
00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:22,540
I'm just some girl who bore your child after you dancing fancy!

20
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,540
Get out!

21
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:29,319
That's not true, listen to me.

22
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:31,980
Stop talking.

23
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:35,500
I'm the only one who understands the abuse I've suffered.

24
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:39,170
If you don't believe me, go do some digging.

25
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:42,170
Otherwise, I'm taking Adam away from this dangerous place.
