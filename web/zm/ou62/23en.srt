1
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:06,780
So this is the surveillance footage from that night.

2
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:11,220
But neither are we not afraid of how enough time to come into crime.

3
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:12,970
Wait a minute.

4
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:14,449
See that?

5
00:00:14,449 --> 00:00:16,170
It's been tampered with.

6
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:17,809
I'll get right on it.

7
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:21,309
What happened to that information that asked you to get about Emma Wood?

8
00:00:21,309 --> 00:00:23,870
Oh, uh, why haven't I read anything back?

9
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:28,940
It's submitted information two weeks ago or so, but

10
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:31,160
Ms. Freya took it.

11
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:35,719
But the diamond, well, she told me she would personally hand it to you.

12
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:36,399
Idiot.

13
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:37,399
Who do you work for?

14
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:41,130
Why would you give it to someone else?

15
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:45,890
It's just Ms. Freya who's a childhood friend, and to be honest,

16
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:48,929
everyone in the mantra thought she would be the next musus.

17
00:00:48,929 --> 00:00:51,929
Tell everyone that my only wife is Erica.

18
00:00:51,929 --> 00:00:53,649
And if anyone else thinks differently,

19
00:00:53,649 --> 00:00:56,369
I'll throw them in the Pacific and feed them to the sharks.

20
00:00:56,369 --> 00:00:57,490
Got it?

21
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:58,250
Yes, boss.

22
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:02,539
No wonder Erica misunderstood my relationship with Freya.

23
00:01:02,539 --> 00:01:07,439
I need to drop clear line with Freya as soon as possible to reassure Erica.

24
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,439
Down's involvement in Emma's death would be related.

25
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:12,480
This is what Erica was most worried about.

26
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,530
If I can find out the truth,

27
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:15,930
I should be a lot happier.

28
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:17,569
Get to the bottom of this.

29
00:01:17,569 --> 00:01:20,930
Especially what Erica said about being abused and imprisoned six years ago,

30
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:25,219
I need to know the truth, the whole truth, all right?

31
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:28,090
And stay away from Freya and her father.

32
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:32,519
And if you mess up again, I know I throw myself into the Pacific.

33
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:39,260
If I do, just get out of here.

34
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:42,510
You will not be harmed anymore, Erica.

35
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:45,510
But now I need to figure out how to win her back.
