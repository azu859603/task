00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I'll never forget you used to touch the rose petals with my fingers.

2
00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:05.509
It was from that moment

3
00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:08.509
that I knew I wanted to be with you the rest of my life.

4
00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:13.910
Erica, you're like a red rose to me.

5
00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:15.910
Radiant, passionate,

6
00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.910
dispelling all the darkness within me,

7
00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.940
and your rejection of my coldness and indifference.

8
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.339
It's like a thorn pierces deep in my heart.

9
00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:32.460
No one does it hurt?

10
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.460
It doesn't matter.

11
00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.460
The beauty of the rose petals are the pain of the thorns.

12
00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:43.960
I love you, and I mean that from the bottom of my heart.

13
00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.960
I went for the operation because I was afraid of being alone.

14
00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.960
I couldn't protect you from my family.

15
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.630
I'm not afraid anymore.

16
00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.950
The only thing that scares me is losing you.

17
00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.369
I'm not perfect.

18
00:00:58.369 --> 00:01:01.689
I'm cold-hearted and domineery.

19
00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:05.359
Could you love somebody like me?
