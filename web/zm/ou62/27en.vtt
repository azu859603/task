00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I knew that as soon as I found you had asked you to marry me

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:13.939
and be with me the rest of your life.

3
00:00:13.939 --> 00:00:15.939
How did your non-laring size?

4
00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:17.940
You couldn't listen back then.

5
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.940
Even though I couldn't see, I held your hand every day.

6
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.160
How could I not know?

7
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.260
You are the love of my life.

8
00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.260
Whether a recording, a pen, or a ring,

9
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.259
they're all my ways of showing my love to you.

10
00:00:33.259 --> 00:00:35.259
Which is never wavered.

11
00:00:35.259 --> 00:00:39.259
I know it will take time to forgive me.

12
00:00:39.259 --> 00:00:44.320
But all I ask is if you give me a chance to prove it myself.

13
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.179
Or if I thought of losing you, it would break my heart.

14
00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:50.539
I never want to let you go.

15
00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:58.539
Even if it means giving up my identity, my status, my house, my eyes, my life, my...

16
00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:20.040
I work like you have your way. Never!
