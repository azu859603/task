00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.299
How want you to find out as soon as possible?

2
00:00:02.299 --> 00:00:10.949
Freya, what are you doing, era?

3
00:00:10.949 --> 00:00:12.839
I think I came to see you.

4
00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:13.839
Are you drunk?

5
00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:16.850
You and my drink.

6
00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:18.879
I am drunk, and you will learn.

7
00:00:18.879 --> 00:00:21.199
And really, you can make me drunk.

8
00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:22.699
You're barely wearing anything.

9
00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:24.199
You're going to catch a cold.

10
00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:26.670
Where's your father?

11
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.170
Don't push me away.

12
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.239
We grew up together.

13
00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:33.740
I should be the one that cares for you, and I understand you the most.

14
00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.740
Then tell me, where did you put the file about him or that Ben gave you?

15
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.740
And when were you planning to tell me about that?

16
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.740
I've been so busy getting your headache medicine from my dad.

17
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.740
The files are my bedside table.

18
00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.740
I was planning to give them to you when you finished your work.

19
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.740
Where were you when Erica was at the pier that day?

20
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.740
I was with my dad the whole time.

21
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:55.740
He was working for you that day.

22
00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.740
I even made him his favorite meal.

23
00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.740
You can check the security feed if you don't believe me.

24
00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.570
Oh, I can do anything for you.

25
00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:03.570
Please start doubt me.

26
00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.569
I love you so much.

27
00:01:05.569 --> 00:01:06.569
Stop saying that.

28
00:01:06.569 --> 00:01:07.569
I never liked you like that.

29
00:01:07.569 --> 00:01:10.569
And since you've seen the files, you know that Erica is Emma.

30
00:01:10.569 --> 00:01:12.569
I will only ever love her.

31
00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:16.569
I will overlook your misgivings because of your father, but there will be no next time.

32
00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:18.569
Stay away from Erica.

33
00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:21.920
If you ever tried to hurt her again, I'll finish you myself.

34
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:34.000
That woman's fault.

35
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
She took Owen's heart.

36
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000
I'm going to kill her.
