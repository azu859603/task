1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.439
I must kill her.

2
00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:02.759
You have to stop.

3
00:00:02.759 --> 00:00:07.169
Oh, and I arrived pretty fast that day.

4
00:00:07.169 --> 00:00:10.900
So it means you might know something.

5
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.060
I don't care!

6
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.740
I've given 20 years of my life to that man.

7
00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:16.899
I've given all of my youth.

8
00:00:16.899 --> 00:00:18.579
Oh, it has to marry me.

9
00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:20.179
Are you getting too obsessive?

10
00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:22.420
What? You can't abandon me now.

11
00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.420
Swear to me.

12
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.260
Swear on the name of my dead mother.

13
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.579
Swear to you, help me, marry Owen.

14
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.469
Swear it!

15
00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:33.789
Okay.

16
00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:39.200
I swear, but if you want to marry Owen,

17
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.329
I have to make sure that one day

18
00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:44.689
he will not hate you.

19
00:00:44.689 --> 00:00:47.299
So you need to find somebody else

20
00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:48.820
to deal with Erika.

21
00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:57.939
I met that pitch Erika's

22
00:00:57.939 --> 00:01:00.820
fiancÃ© at the cafe last time.

23
00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.380
That stupid man.

24
00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.859
He's going to help me torture Erika.
