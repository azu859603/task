00:00:02,379 --> 00:00:11,859
That's not fair. I want a kiss too. Hey look who's the kid here. I'm the cutest I

2
00:00:11,859 --> 00:00:17,530
get all the kisses not you. By the way why don't you ever call me dad. Just try it

3
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:26,460
just once. No you're very scared sometimes. What? Come on try it. I'll be nice. I'll be

4
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:34,460
the nicest dad in the world. You dreamy. That's really you. So you just bust

5
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:45,840
in wanting to see sir. You must have Adam. Adam don't let me down. After all I did to get

6
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:58,259
you here. The bigger the scene, the better. You never call you dad. Adam is my child.

00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:04,980
Adam is mine and Owen's child. Let him go. Then why does he call me dad? Have you

8
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:11,900
forgotten we could have a child with or why your father insists you to marry me.

9
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:16,359
Explain this.
