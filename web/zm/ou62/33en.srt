1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,459
Court him down, you bastard!

2
00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:03,899
Let go of my son!

3
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:06,500
Your son, he does not even recognize you.

4
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,000
You're pathetic, covered.

5
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:10,160
Dad, you're hurting me.

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,160
Let me go.

7
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,320
Shut up.

8
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,820
Have you forgot how I thought you?

9
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:15,820
No crying.

10
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,320
No talk back.

11
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,320
He's an innocent child.

12
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,320
If you want, come at me, but let him go.

13
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,320
Alright, that's enough.

14
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,320
Listen, I'll give you whatever you want.

15
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,820
Just put him down.

16
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:27,820
Let him go.

17
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,820
What I want?

18
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:33,950
You took away my woman, my child.

19
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,950
They belong to me.

20
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:38,950
You even had the boss to hit me in the car for less time.

21
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:42,200
I want you to kneel before me.

22
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,200
What are you crazy?

23
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,520
Do you understand what you're talking to?

24
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,520
Aren't you afraid to get hit by a car when you get outside?

25
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,520
Down on your knees.

26
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:56,799
Three, two...
