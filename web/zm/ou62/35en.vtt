00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:06.629
I'll be back.

2
00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.630
What's up, please?

3
00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:14.099
Well, as they found, some news from the police regarding Ms. Emma's death.

4
00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.100
Since you told me to stop, I already died.

5
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.100
What is it?

6
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.550
Ms. Emma has been living secretly with a plan for all six years.

7
00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.550
And there have been some very intimate pictures of this.

8
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.550
Could it be that she was actually cheating?

9
00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.550
Careful.

10
00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.320
I swear, if you're lying, get to that point.

11
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.320
I found something.

12
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.020
What?

13
00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.020
All the dirt?

14
00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.570
Let's go to the police station.

15
00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.570
Maybe this letter will have some answers.

16
00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:52.939
Mommy, we should always be together.

17
00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:55.579
Sweetie, what are you talking about?

18
00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:59.119
Of course we will always be together.

19
00:00:59.119 --> 00:01:01.469
I will always protect you.

20
00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.069
You know that?

21
00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:05.069
Don't worry.

22
00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:09.109
Dad?

23
00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:11.200
What are you doing here?

24
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.200
Oh my goodness.

25
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.200
My dear Erica.

26
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.200
How can you live in such a dump?

27
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.200
Is this how your new boyfriend is treating you?

28
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.200
I tell you, I won't allow it.

29
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.200
What are you talking about?
