1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,629
Is that your fake sympathy?

2
00:00:02,629 --> 00:00:06,129
I hate that. Stop it. Spit it out. Why are you here?

3
00:00:06,129 --> 00:00:09,130
I've got good news for you.

4
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:12,289
Your days of suffering are over.

5
00:00:12,289 --> 00:00:16,289
Dan's father, Henry Morrison, the head of the Morrison family,

6
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:20,289
sent someone to tell us that Dan is willing to marry you.

7
00:00:20,289 --> 00:00:24,289
You and I just have to go back and we'll get back to our bougie lifestyle.

8
00:00:24,289 --> 00:00:26,289
So celebrate your little victory.

9
00:00:26,289 --> 00:00:29,289
It's not about me going back to some bougie lifestyle.

10
00:00:29,289 --> 00:00:34,020
It's about you getting as much money as you want.

11
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,020
Look, I raised you to marry a wealthy and powerful man

12
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:40,020
to help support the family, right?

13
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,020
Now this is what you should do.

14
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:47,020
You should be grateful that I'm helping you marry into such a noble family.

15
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:50,299
chosen gratitude.

16
00:00:50,299 --> 00:00:53,399
Sweetheart, I need to talk to Grandpa about something.

17
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:56,399
Why don't you go to the study and find your dad?

18
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:02,689
Is that your kid with a new boyfriend?

19
00:01:02,689 --> 00:01:04,689
Well, he got big.

20
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:06,689
Does this house belong to him too?

21
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:09,689
If it truly does, then you need to get busy.

22
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:12,689
Anybody who can afford land here is either wealthy or powerful.

23
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:15,689
Maybe even more powerful than the Morrison's.

24
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:17,689
But you need to decide.

25
00:01:17,689 --> 00:01:20,689
Him or Dan, or maybe you could serve them both.

26
00:01:20,689 --> 00:01:21,689
I don't care.

27
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:23,689
Either way, our family will truly prosper.

28
00:01:23,689 --> 00:01:25,689
Enough, Bert Wood.

29
00:01:25,689 --> 00:01:28,689
You are disgusting.

30
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:30,689
Listen to yourself.

31
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:34,010
Are your daughters some goods for you to trade?

32
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:37,200
If that's the case, I don't have a father.

33
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,489
You, Bert.

34
00:01:39,489 --> 00:01:41,489
How dare you speak to me like that?

35
00:01:41,489 --> 00:01:43,579
Time to teach you a lesson.
