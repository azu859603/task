1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,040
I know you are the heir and ruler of the largest

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,000
conglomerate in North America.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm just a girl from an ordinary family.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Listen, Erica, look at me.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
To me, you're the most exceptional and beautiful woman I know.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And that's all that matters to me.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,300
You know what?

8
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,300
Even if you were a beggar, I would still love you.

9
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,300
Say that again?

10
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,300
Say what?

11
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,140
I love you.

12
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:30,140
Come here.

13
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:50,520
Why is this a DNA report?

14
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,619
After our laboratories repeated tests,

15
00:00:53,619 --> 00:00:56,619
the first genetic test was found to have been tampered with.

16
00:00:56,619 --> 00:01:01,619
On the second test, the genetic match between Adam's sample

17
00:01:01,619 --> 00:01:04,620
and Owen's is 0.1%,

18
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:08,620
indicating no blood relation between the two.

19
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:17,299
Beautiful weather today.

20
00:01:17,299 --> 00:01:19,299
Perfect for doing something meaningful.

21
00:01:19,299 --> 00:01:20,299
Really?

22
00:01:20,299 --> 00:01:22,299
I'm going to play a new game?

23
00:01:22,299 --> 00:01:23,620
Maybe later.

24
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:25,620
Would you like to know how your sister died?

25
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:29,959
I think today we're going to finally find out what really happened.

26
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:30,959
What do you mean?

27
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:32,959
I want you to bear witness to this.

28
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:38,340
Son, would you like to watch your daddy punch some bad guys?

29
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,859
Oh, dare you treat me like this.

30
00:01:42,859 --> 00:01:46,859
I'm going to get my attorneys, and I'm going to sue every one of you.

31
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:47,859
Let me go!

32
00:01:47,859 --> 00:01:48,959
Relax.

33
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:50,959
You're just here to enjoy the show.

34
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:55,209
But if you keep yelling, I'm going to have him tape your mouth shut.

35
00:01:55,209 --> 00:02:02,629
You play your trick to sell your daughter to a family.

36
00:02:02,629 --> 00:02:03,629
You'd be so lucky.

37
00:02:03,629 --> 00:02:04,629
Who are you?

38
00:02:04,629 --> 00:02:05,629
We'll get to that.

39
00:02:05,629 --> 00:02:08,629
In the meantime, I want to introduce you to someone.

40
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:12,610
Say to me.

41
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:13,610
Say to me.

42
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:15,310
Say to me.

43
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:16,310
Say to me.

44
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,379
So sorry.

45
00:02:17,379 --> 00:02:18,379
I don't dare you.

46
00:02:18,379 --> 00:02:19,379
I hurt my son.

47
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:20,379
I'm in prison.

48
00:02:20,379 --> 00:02:21,379
How dare you?

49
00:02:21,379 --> 00:02:24,020
I assure you there's nothing illegal going on here.

50
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:26,020
See for yourself, not a scratch.

51
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,020
The tithes are turning.

52
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,020
Your family's going down.

53
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,659
You're a man.

54
00:02:31,659 --> 00:02:33,979
Go to arrogance.

55
00:02:33,979 --> 00:02:35,979
I advise you to apologize now.

56
00:02:35,979 --> 00:02:38,229
I'm not proof of my family.

57
00:02:38,229 --> 00:02:41,550
Or I make sure you can't survive in this city.

58
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:42,550
I will you.

59
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:45,550
The last person who said that is in the grave.

60
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:49,719
Yeah.

61
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:50,719
The company's stopped.

62
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:52,719
The price has hit the limit down.

63
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:54,719
The family's going bankrupt.

64
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:56,009
What, baby?

65
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,009
Seems like you got the short straw.

66
00:02:58,009 --> 00:03:00,580
What have you done?

67
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:04,180
Just having a little fun.

68
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,180
It's impossible.

69
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:07,180
You couldn't have done this all by yourself.

70
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,180
It has to be a trick.

71
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,139
Sir.

72
00:03:11,139 --> 00:03:13,460
This is our family crest.

73
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,460
It represents everything we stand for.

74
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,460
Truth and honor.

75
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,460
Russell family.

76
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,710
Remember Russell family.

77
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:22,710
Oh my God.

78
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:23,710
Oh and Russell.

79
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:29,289
Just with the heir and the current leader of Russell family.

80
00:03:29,289 --> 00:03:32,289
Are you still going to force Erika to marry your worthless son?

81
00:03:32,289 --> 00:03:33,289
Miss Owen.

82
00:03:33,289 --> 00:03:35,610
No, it's all fault.

83
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:36,610
It's all fault.

84
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:38,610
We shouldn't have your sweet Miss Erika.

85
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:40,610
I'll do anything you ask.

86
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:41,610
Just please spare us.

87
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:42,610
Anything?

88
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:43,610
Anything.

89
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:44,610
Anything.

90
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:45,610
Get down on your knees.

91
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:47,610
And beg my forgiveness.

92
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:49,610
And I'll consider pardoning your family.

93
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:51,789
Miss Owen.

94
00:03:51,789 --> 00:03:52,789
Please spare us.

95
00:03:52,789 --> 00:03:53,789
Spare our family.

96
00:03:53,789 --> 00:03:55,789
Do you really think I was being serious?

97
00:03:55,789 --> 00:03:56,789
Get up.

98
00:03:56,789 --> 00:04:00,199
You tricked us, huh?

99
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:01,360
What?

100
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,580
You tricked us?

101
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,580
Fuck.

102
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:08,569
Do you think a simple apology is going to make up for everything that you did?

103
00:04:08,569 --> 00:04:09,569
Your time's over.

104
00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:11,569
Now you're going to pay.

105
00:04:11,569 --> 00:04:12,569
Dad!

106
00:04:12,569 --> 00:04:19,100
Dad, more reason you're under arrest on the suspicion of murdering Emma Uud.

107
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:21,259
Father!

108
00:04:21,259 --> 00:04:22,259
Father!

109
00:04:22,259 --> 00:04:24,360
Please help me!

110
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,360
Did you really think you'd get away with it?

111
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:34,160
Emma was always one step out of you.

112
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,560
Justice will prevail in the end.

113
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,560
Owen, what's going on?

114
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:51,459
I think it's time that you know the whole truth about what happened.

115
00:04:51,459 --> 00:04:53,459
Erika, my sister.

116
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:59,459
Perhaps by now I'm no longer in this world, but I still want to apologize to you sincerely.

117
00:04:59,459 --> 00:05:02,160
I'm sorry.

118
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,160
It was my selfishness to be with Dan that led me to see your boy Adam.

119
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,160
I never expected you to call your break down a memory loss.

120
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:16,160
I also never expected that that once, Dan found out Adam wasn't his biological son.

121
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,160
He would immediately start abusing us and even send people to kill us.

122
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,160
So, I love this message in advance.

123
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,160
If you're reading this letter, then he has killed me at this point.

124
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,160
I'm sorry I can't apologize to you in person.

125
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,160
I tried to take back your status for you.

126
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:39,319
So, when I found out Owen was looking for you everywhere, I sent him information about Adam

127
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:42,480
and secretly arranged for Adam to meet you.

128
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,480
I once loved the wrong person.

129
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,480
But I hope you can't reunite with your family.

130
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,120
I sincerely wish you happiness.

131
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,660
Be happy for me.

132
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:58,589
You're a responsible sister, Emma.

133
00:05:58,589 --> 00:05:59,589
Love you always.

134
00:05:59,589 --> 00:06:15,810
Atlas, I've sacrificed everything for you.

135
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:17,810
How could you?

136
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:26,699
Your sister are liars, liars.

137
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:29,120
And let me tell you one thing.

138
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,620
Do you think this is the truth?

139
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:37,620
Even if you think that Adam isn't my child, are you sure that he's yours?

140
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,620
Prison is a place that's going to chew you up and spit you out.

141
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:45,620
If I were you, I'd use your remaining assets instead of a good funeral plan for him.

142
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,620
Thank you, sir, also.

143
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:50,639
I'm not invited to know the family.

144
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:57,439
Adam is our child.

145
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:14,269
Who could be behind this fake DNA report?

146
00:07:14,269 --> 00:07:16,529
If I recall, you previously were...

147
00:07:16,529 --> 00:07:17,529
No, no, no, no.

148
00:07:17,529 --> 00:07:20,589
I will comply with all of your arrangements.

149
00:07:20,589 --> 00:07:21,589
All right.

150
00:07:21,589 --> 00:07:28,750
Given the recent happenings and your age, you're no longer capable of being in charge of wood family.

151
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:32,879
And that title should rightfully pass to Erica.

152
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:37,449
Here's the contract for your transfer.

153
00:07:37,449 --> 00:07:41,449
Just on here, and you can quickly step into your retirement.

154
00:07:41,449 --> 00:07:42,540
That's great.

155
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:45,930
Mr. Russell is very considerate.

156
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:50,379
But I will not take any more of your precious time.

157
00:07:50,379 --> 00:08:06,379
Mr. Russell has prepared a nursing home for you, and we will leave immediately.

158
00:08:06,379 --> 00:08:07,379
Fucking Erica.

159
00:08:07,379 --> 00:08:10,329
Leave Dan.

160
00:08:10,329 --> 00:08:12,329
Bert and Harry couldn't deal with you.

161
00:08:12,329 --> 00:08:21,009
Time to unleash my beast.

162
00:08:21,009 --> 00:08:29,000
Now that I've got you here, why don't we clear up all the misunderstandings once and for all?

163
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Okay, you go.

164
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,480
I'm listening.

165
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:39,940
First, that day by the pier, I'm sorry I didn't listen to you.

166
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:44,940
I recovered the footage, and yes, you were taken.

167
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,940
Let's leave that in the past.

168
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:49,029
I did think about leaving then.

169
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:50,029
What?

170
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,639
What is the second thing?

171
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:59,879
The second thing is when you were taken back then.

172
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:01,879
I want to know everything that happened.

173
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:02,879
First hand.

174
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:07,879
Reed locked me in the basement, gave me abortion pills.

175
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:12,879
He also told me that, that whole thing was orchestrated by you.

176
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:17,879
Because you were afraid that me and my child would leave a stain on your family.

177
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:18,879
Nonsense!

178
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:22,840
Reed told me that you were taken away by the family.

179
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:27,899
And that he tried to intervene, but he was injured in the process.

180
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:32,379
I've known him since I was a boy.

181
00:09:32,379 --> 00:09:34,700
Maybe he had his reasons.

182
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,700
I mean, he did let me go at the end.

183
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:40,179
Why don't you have a talk with him?

184
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:43,330
Leave no regrets.

185
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:48,330
Dan and Bert were brought in by Freya, probably to so discord between us.

186
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:51,330
She even switched to Adam's DNA report.

187
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:53,330
Didn't many other crazy things.

188
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:56,320
Yeah, she's just crazy.

189
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,320
If he provokes me again, I will beat her up.

190
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:08,169
Tomorrow I have some things to take care of at the south matter.

191
00:10:08,169 --> 00:10:10,299
It may take a day or two.

192
00:10:10,299 --> 00:10:12,299
In the meantime, stay away from her.

193
00:10:12,299 --> 00:10:13,299
Be careful.

194
00:10:13,299 --> 00:10:16,330
When I get back, we'll deal with them together.

195
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:18,539
Good.

196
00:10:18,539 --> 00:10:22,049
So now, we'll let it weave.

197
00:10:22,049 --> 00:10:23,049
Clear it up.

198
00:10:23,049 --> 00:10:26,389
All the misunderstandings.

199
00:10:26,389 --> 00:10:28,490
How about we do something productive?

200
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:29,490
What?

201
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:31,539
Hmm.

202
00:10:31,539 --> 00:10:45,309
My poor daughter.

203
00:10:45,309 --> 00:10:50,179
It's time to back up for everything, so that we can live on.

204
00:10:50,179 --> 00:10:53,100
I will plead with Owen.

205
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,580
I believe in his character.

206
00:10:55,580 --> 00:11:00,450
Three generations of our families serve them.

207
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:03,450
So I'm sure you will show us mercy.

208
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:10,250
Look at you.

209
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:14,100
There's no turning back.

210
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:19,379
Ever since we hurt, there's no turning back.

211
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:25,379
Do you really think that a man like Owen would actually forgive somebody for hurting his child?

212
00:11:25,379 --> 00:11:28,080
Don't be afraid, Dan.

213
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,080
Trust me.

214
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,529
I will make Owen fall in love with me.

215
00:11:32,529 --> 00:11:36,980
I'll make him see that I am the right partner for him.

216
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:40,070
As long as that bitch in that bastard is dead.

217
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:42,070
You will take him out.

218
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:44,070
Tomorrow as planned.

219
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,070
Leave the rest to me.

220
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:47,299
I'm going to deal with it personally.

221
00:11:47,299 --> 00:12:12,370
Adam, sweetie.

222
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:13,500
Stop playing.

223
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,500
Time to go to bed.

224
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:23,919
You, my roses.

225
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:26,919
Even when they're crushed, they can still hurt people.

226
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:29,110
Dad, you're done.

227
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:40,210
I'm sure that he already knows everything.

228
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:42,210
I'm sure that he probably wants to kill me.

229
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:47,419
But right now, my father has been completely distracted.

230
00:12:47,419 --> 00:12:52,809
And you, I'm going to thoroughly enjoy torturing you.

231
00:12:52,809 --> 00:12:59,730
I failed six years ago to kill you in this bastard.

232
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:01,730
I won't hesitate anymore.

233
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:06,080
And I will not allow you to come between me and Owen's marriage.

234
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,080
You are insane.

235
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,080
Nonsense.

236
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:16,330
If you want to save your son, get on your knees and crawl through the roses.

237
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:17,330
Do it.

238
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:19,330
Now, I'm going to whip him high.

239
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:21,059
No.

240
00:13:21,059 --> 00:13:23,059
Then get on your knees.

241
00:13:23,059 --> 00:13:28,519
Crawl through the roses.

242
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:33,370
Now, I will do what you say.

243
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:34,370
Just don't hurt him.

244
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:35,370
Mm-hmm.

245
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:38,970
Get over here now.

246
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:40,830
That's okay.

247
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:42,830
Mom will risk you.

248
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:43,830
Don't risk her.

249
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:51,090
Stupid bitch.

250
00:13:52,379 --> 00:13:56,470
You are nothing but a low-life bitch from a shit hole.

251
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,470
How dare you look at me like that.

252
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,500
Look at you.

253
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,500
You're kneeling on the floor.

254
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:05,019
So act like a maggot that you are.

255
00:14:05,019 --> 00:14:08,299
Stop looking at me like some tough dog.

256
00:14:08,299 --> 00:14:09,299
I'm a dog.

257
00:14:09,299 --> 00:14:11,299
Look at yourself.

258
00:14:11,299 --> 00:14:16,299
You are drowning in your jealousy because of your insecurities.

259
00:14:16,299 --> 00:14:20,820
Do you have a few words of anyone's love?

260
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:30,000
Mine and Owen's love has nothing to do with status or background or our families.

261
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
We just love each other.

262
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:38,159
And you are committing unforgivable things for a man who never showed you a sex.

263
00:14:38,159 --> 00:15:00,179
I'm going to destroy my entire family and since I can't get rid of it again,

264
00:15:00,179 --> 00:15:05,600
I'm going to take away the person who loves the most, which is you.

265
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:39,330
Of wrong things, I will take all the blame.

266
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:41,460
You'll take all the blame?

267
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:43,460
She hurt the ones I love the most.

268
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:46,509
She's going to pay.

269
00:15:46,509 --> 00:15:47,509
And you.

270
00:15:47,509 --> 00:15:50,659
I know what you did.

271
00:15:50,659 --> 00:16:01,860
I know whoever I trusted you more than anyone.

272
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,980
Sorry, sir.

273
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,980
I know I betrayed your trust.

274
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,259
I'll fray-eye as my only daughter.

275
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:10,259
She got totally obsessed by you.

276
00:16:10,259 --> 00:16:13,259
Her love for you, I've driven her mad.

277
00:16:13,259 --> 00:16:15,259
It's my fault.

278
00:16:16,419 --> 00:16:19,870
As her father will not stop being her.

279
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:23,669
Even for helping her.

280
00:16:23,669 --> 00:16:24,830
Is Erica.

281
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:27,860
I'm sorry for all the harm.

282
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:30,019
I will.

283
00:16:30,019 --> 00:16:32,019
All the darkness.

284
00:16:32,019 --> 00:16:33,019
I promise.

285
00:16:33,019 --> 00:16:34,019
But please.

286
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:35,139
Please.

287
00:16:35,139 --> 00:16:36,460
Spare.

288
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:37,500
Free us life.

289
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,580
I'm sorry for you.

290
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,580
Fail.

291
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:46,730
To protect you forever.

292
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:49,789
Or give me for not fulfilling your wish.

293
00:16:51,019 --> 00:16:54,429
If there's another chance I would do better.

294
00:16:54,429 --> 00:17:00,080
I love you, Freya.

295
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,240
Oh, well.

296
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,500
You always treated me like family.

297
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:12,900
I owe you a lot.

298
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:40,500
If there's another life.

299
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:47,940
Letting Freya go, truly gone mad.

300
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:54,779
Sending her to the mental hospital was the best option.

301
00:17:54,779 --> 00:18:00,880
She meant that I can see that you're upset.

302
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,130
Harry's gone to prison.

303
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:06,859
Dan's verdict's out.

304
00:18:06,859 --> 00:18:13,000
Evidence is sentence to death.

305
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,470
We're in a nursing home and finally have you back here with me.

306
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:24,819
We could finally start a new life together.

307
00:18:24,819 --> 00:18:28,500
An angel sent from heaven.

308
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,839
I'm sorry I didn't keep my promise.

309
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:33,839
I shouldn't have left you alone.

310
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:34,839
You needed me most.

311
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:38,160
Well, let's start making up for a very present.

312
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:51,579
That's not sweet.

313
00:18:51,579 --> 00:19:03,819
What's wrong with you?

314
00:19:03,819 --> 00:19:09,259
I think this bed is too small.

315
00:19:09,259 --> 00:19:29,819
I want to hear the violin.

316
00:19:29,819 --> 00:19:31,369
What are you doing?

317
00:19:31,369 --> 00:19:45,940
Are you flying?

318
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:56,630
I'm in that ER.

319
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:59,460
Dad was exercising.

320
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,460
Really hot in there.

321
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:02,720
Exerciding in the bathroom?

322
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:07,849
I'm enjoying.

323
00:20:07,849 --> 00:20:16,450
Get down on the floor and give me 20%.

324
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:17,450
I don't want to find this here.

325
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:42,069
I'm actually taken from all.

326
00:20:42,069 --> 00:20:43,680
Hmm.

327
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,680
He's always like that.

328
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,799
He's having his shoes.

329
00:20:47,799 --> 00:20:50,150
I don't blame him.

330
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:55,170
But more siblings to play with.

331
00:20:55,170 --> 00:21:19,380
You're paying.

332
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,859
Yes, yes.

333
00:21:21,859 --> 00:21:24,859
The best accommodations, the best teachers.

334
00:21:24,859 --> 00:21:26,859
An absolutely no room for error.

335
00:21:26,859 --> 00:21:33,390
Problems?

336
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:35,349
Of course.

337
00:21:35,349 --> 00:21:37,349
Starting next week, Adam will attend.

338
00:21:37,349 --> 00:21:40,579
The best ways of crowding summer can't be in the world.

339
00:21:40,579 --> 00:21:42,579
For a whole month.

340
00:21:42,579 --> 00:21:50,769
The boss' mind is becoming harder and harder to read.

341
00:21:50,769 --> 00:21:54,079
I really need a vacation.

342
00:21:54,079 --> 00:22:02,359
What do I have to go through some accounts?

343
00:22:02,359 --> 00:22:07,220
Well, because Adam, it's time that you brought me a real man.

344
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:09,640
You can protect your mom.

345
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:14,339
Because you're too energetic, taking up too much of your mom's time.

346
00:22:14,339 --> 00:22:17,910
Then what do I have to go for a whole month?

347
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:21,140
Well, there's a lot to learn.

348
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:24,740
And that's what you're going to grow up a lot faster.

349
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:25,740
Don't worry.

350
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:28,740
We'll come up with you up soon.

351
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:29,740
Okay.

352
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:34,599
Because your presence is preventing them from having another child.

353
00:22:34,599 --> 00:22:39,710
Uncle Ben, Dad said true.

354
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:41,710
Oh no.

355
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:47,940
There goes my month-long vacation.

356
00:22:47,940 --> 00:23:15,069
I told you don't have to do anything.

357
00:23:15,069 --> 00:23:17,549
Let me take care of you.

358
00:23:17,549 --> 00:23:19,769
That's it.

359
00:23:19,769 --> 00:23:26,700
Here's your tea.

360
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,700
Thank you.

361
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,339
Would you like a donut?

362
00:23:29,339 --> 00:23:30,339
Oh my God.

363
00:23:30,339 --> 00:23:32,559
Is that like I can do anything anymore?

364
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:36,720
Well, I'm just trying to make up for all those last years of being a good dad.

365
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,720
Taste it.

366
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:47,400
Would you like it?

367
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,400
Yeah.

368
00:23:48,400 --> 00:24:08,569
Hey, Emma.

369
00:24:08,569 --> 00:24:12,650
Sorry we couldn't have eaten to you for so long.

370
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:15,099
Dan got what he deserved.

371
00:24:15,099 --> 00:24:18,579
Sometimes I wonder if you can see us from up there.

372
00:24:18,579 --> 00:24:21,660
Guess what?

373
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:26,230
We're going to have another baby.

374
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:30,630
Doctor says it's a girl.

375
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:32,630
I want to name her after you.

376
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:36,390
Is that okay?

377
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:40,450
When the time comes, I'll bring her to see you.

378
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:47,700
Emma's a beautiful man.

379
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:50,109
Our daughter will love it too.

380
00:24:50,109 --> 00:24:53,690
You're still like me when I'm a sister.

381
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:57,490
I'll be a good big brother.

382
00:24:57,490 --> 00:24:59,490
Of course!

383
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:01,490
No matter how many children we have,

384
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:04,490
Daddy's always going to have time to play soccer with you.

385
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:19,769
Goodbye, Emma.

386
00:25:19,769 --> 00:25:20,769
Just like you hoped.

387
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:24,750
I found my happiness.
