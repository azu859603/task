00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,939
Sir, our stock is being sorted aggressively. We're about to hit the limit down.

2
00:00:10,939 --> 00:00:13,460
What the hell is going on here?

3
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:19,019
Half of you came from major investment banks. Our stock is about to crash and you're telling

4
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,699
me there's nothing we can do.

5
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:26,820
Sir, this is a coordinated attack from multiple investment funds. They're shorting us simultaneously.

6
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,940
There is nothing we can do.

7
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:35,590
Sir, what are our next steps?

8
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:45,179
Well, looks like Shepherd View might be a backdrop by lunchtime.

9
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:46,939
Hey, this is a privacy lesson.

10
00:00:46,939 --> 00:00:47,939
Excuse me, ma'am.

11
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:50,340
Could you hold on cleaning for just a couple minutes?

12
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:57,850
Mr. Shepherd, building a public company and they're just by the years? That's impressive.

13
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:05,650
But losing your cool over a little market turbulence? That seems out of character for you.

14
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:09,150
Do I know you?

15
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,150
Wait, what are you doing?
