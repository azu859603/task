00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.799
What are you doing? You can't do this, you're just a cleaner.

2
00:00:02.799 --> 00:00:04.799
Come be messing with our company funds.

3
00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.140
This is incredible! What's going on?

4
00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:13.740
For sure. It's him. It's failing. The price is holding.

5
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.440
Boss, our stock price is reaching today's opening value.

6
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.969
We might be four.

7
00:00:22.969 --> 00:00:25.969
They're still cleaning to do a mission ship artifact.

8
00:00:25.969 --> 00:00:30.030
Tell me, how could I ever repay you for this?

9
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:43.420
If the opportunity ever arises, you could give your next contract for construction to a Harrison group.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.960
Jason, can we have fire for now?
