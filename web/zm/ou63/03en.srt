00:00:07,219 --> 00:00:09,890
Mr. Yates.

2
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:11,890
What? Only two bodyguards this time?

3
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:14,890
You're not going soft on me, are you?

4
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:17,890
No, ma'am, I just thought you might like the screen today.

5
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:23,660
Now listen, everyone is waiting in New York for you to claim your inheritance to see you have the lowest ground.

6
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:27,660
Mr. Yates, you know that my investigations here aren't finished.

7
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,660
Ma'am, I still don't understand why you've kept your identity a secret.

8
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:33,659
Why are you married this Ben Harrison fellow?

9
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:35,659
Look, today is Ben's birthday.

10
00:00:35,659 --> 00:00:38,659
Anything we need to discuss, we can do it some other time.

11
00:00:38,659 --> 00:00:43,659
Ma'am, it really is time for you to set your inheritance.

12
00:00:43,659 --> 00:00:47,659
Because what I want is a simple life with Ben.

13
00:00:47,659 --> 00:00:55,460
Ma'am, at least do me a favor and let Terry walk you up to the house, for my sake.

14
00:00:55,460 --> 00:01:06,739
Divorce papers, sign in.
