1
00:00:01,649 --> 00:00:04,700
Why?

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,700
You were not worthy of my son getting more.

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,699
The Harrison group is practically a local celebrity now,

4
00:00:10,699 --> 00:00:13,699
especially since it's landed a $100 million contract.

5
00:00:13,699 --> 00:00:15,699
The Shepherd Group.

6
00:00:15,699 --> 00:00:17,120
And you.

7
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,120
You're just a cleaner.

8
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:23,120
The truth is, Laura, I've wanted a divorce for a very long time.

9
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,120
I need a wife who reflects my status.

10
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:29,120
I secured that $100 million contract.

11
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,120
You!

12
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,119
A cleaning woman!

13
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:34,119
You're putting up million dollar deals.

14
00:00:34,119 --> 00:00:36,119
Don't make me laugh.

15
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:39,119
I did!

16
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:42,119
It was my present to Betty for his birthday.

17
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:45,119
I was the one who got right here and seemed to give Ben that deal.

18
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:47,600
What are you doing here?

19
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,600
Clearly, Ben has found himself a woman more suitable for the Harrison family.

20
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,600
Amber's family.

21
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,659
He's practically the local royalty.

22
00:00:54,659 --> 00:00:56,659
Local royalty.

23
00:00:56,659 --> 00:00:59,659
A small-town rich person is royalty.

24
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:02,659
And what qualifications do you have to judge, Miss Cleaner?

25
00:01:02,659 --> 00:01:06,659
Your resume boasts supermarket cashier and dinner waitress alongside janitor.

26
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:07,659
Doesn't it?

27
00:01:07,659 --> 00:01:11,969
Ben, what's going on?

28
00:01:11,969 --> 00:01:14,379
Is this what you want a divorce?

29
00:01:14,379 --> 00:01:15,379
Because of her?

30
00:01:15,379 --> 00:01:16,379
Oh, please.

31
00:01:16,379 --> 00:01:19,379
I've spent years building Harrison group.

32
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:20,379
You're still a cleaner.

33
00:01:20,379 --> 00:01:23,379
You just grew apart, that's all you've got.

34
00:01:23,379 --> 00:01:24,379
A part?

35
00:01:24,379 --> 00:01:26,540
No.

36
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:30,340
No, I won't sign any agreement with this.
