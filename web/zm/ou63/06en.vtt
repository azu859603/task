00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Sir?

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Laura Lewis' information.

3
00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:08.759
She's been Harrison's wife.

4
00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:10.759
No wonder why she won her department.

5
00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:13.789
Actually, Sir, been Harrison just divorced her.

6
00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:16.460
Orson?

7
00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.230
Wait a minute.

8
00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.839
Don't you remember?

9
00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:24.839
She's the one who helped us with the sweet contract three years ago.

10
00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:25.839
Yeah.

11
00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:27.839
She saved our hiding now.

12
00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:28.839
Remember?

13
00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:33.159
Why would Ben Harrison dump someone who just got him a hundred million dollar contract?

14
00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.630
Let's get to the bottom of this.

15
00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:42.950
Hey, why don't you do it?

16
00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.549
Let's go with me.

17
00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:46.549
Tell the guy's this instant.

18
00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:51.560
Dealing from the Harrison's.

19
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.560
We gave you a generous divorce settlement.

20
00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:54.560
You refused it.

21
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.689
And now you're stealing.

22
00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:57.689
She couldn't afford it.

23
00:00:57.689 --> 00:00:59.689
You're a thief.

24
00:00:59.689 --> 00:01:06.640
That's mine.

25
00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:07.640
Give it back.

26
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:08.640
No.
