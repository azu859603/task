1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,879
Laura, I want to say thank you properly for saving Shepherd Group.

2
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:11,400
It's, it's really no, no worries, Mr. Shepherd, but um, I'm just going through a divorce.

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,359
You see, it's, who are you, Laura's new squeeze?

4
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:17,480
Excuse me, do you know who I am?

5
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,480
Is this true?

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,280
You hooked up with this man, while you were married to my son?

7
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,280
Shame on you!

8
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,280
Mr. Shepherd, I'm...

9
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,000
For your information, my name is Brian Shepherd.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,120
I'm CEO of the Shepherd Group.

11
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:33,240
Oh please, a big shout like Brian Shepherd wouldn't be called dead for the cleaner.

12
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,600
You really don't recognize him, do you, Amber?

13
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,679
That's really interesting considering I thought you were the one that secured that contract

14
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:41,679
for Ben.

15
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:42,679
That's ridiculous.

16
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:45,200
He doesn't look like that.

17
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,200
My ring.

18
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,200
Jason, give it back to the sleeves.

19
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:52,179
What are you doing?

20
00:00:52,179 --> 00:00:54,579
Laura, let's get you out of here.

21
00:00:54,579 --> 00:00:55,579
Now.

22
00:00:55,579 --> 00:00:56,579
Hold on a minute, Laura.

23
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:57,579
Who the heck is this man?

24
00:00:57,579 --> 00:00:59,979
Have you been sneaking around?

25
00:00:59,979 --> 00:01:01,439
That's all right, man.

26
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:02,640
This is none of your business.

27
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,640
Oh, Brad said bodies.

28
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:07,799
You're not going anywhere until that's what you tell us what's going on.

29
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:08,799
We are the Harrison's.

30
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,359
You can't just waltz in here and take her.

31
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:13,840
Harrison, compared to the Shepherd Group, you're nobody.

32
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,840
I'll go back.

33
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,840
What?

34
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,359
Are you saying that is Brian Shepherd?

35
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:19,359
That's a lie.

36
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:21,200
Don't you dare walk away from me, Laura.

37
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,200
You come back here and explain yourself.

38
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,760
Don't you take another step towards my son, Laura?
