00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:05,019
Laura, does Ben even know you were the one who secured the 100 million deal?

2
00:00:05,019 --> 00:00:09,849
Let's just say that Ben underestimated me.

3
00:00:09,849 --> 00:00:12,849
I don't feel good about going through the signing event.

4
00:00:12,849 --> 00:00:17,420
After how they treated you, maybe we should cancel it.

5
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:27,780
No, no, the event will proceed. Besides, I'll be there.

6
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,159
There's a lot that I don't know about you, Laura. Who are you, truly?

7
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,929
You'll find out, Mr. Shepherd.

8
00:00:35,929 --> 00:00:41,899
Um, can you pull up over here, please?

9
00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:48,159
Mr. Gates, I want you to call all of the Lewis Group's business partners,

10
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:53,320
and we're going to have a meeting, an investment meeting, one week from today.

11
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,310
Make sure everyone is there.

12
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:05,709
Because after that meeting, I'm going to reclaim my place as the CEO of Lewis Group.

13
00:01:05,709 --> 00:01:09,810
Oh, excellent, Miss Lewis. I'll stop making arrangements tomorrow.

14
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:18,219
Ben Harrison, you're going to know exactly what it feels like to lose everything.
