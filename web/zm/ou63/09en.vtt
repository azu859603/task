00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:07.830
After this ceremony, the Harrison family will finally be considered make-a-wood city royalty.

2
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.050
Only after then, my darling, we can get married.

3
00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:14.050
Laura, what are you doing here?

4
00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:19.050
Security? Get that woman out of here! We don't need cleanness at this event!

5
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.050
Why wouldn't I be here? This is a business event, after all?

6
00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.050
Business? You wouldn't know business if you ate you on the head.

7
00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.109
A fancy dress doesn't make you high society, honey. Just get out!

8
00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.109
Don't tell me you've come looking for another rich man to play mistress for.

9
00:00:34.109 --> 00:00:36.109
You should have taken my $100,000 offer.

10
00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:41.109
Oh, Ben. Do you really think that you can sign this contract without me?

11
00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:45.429
Laura, this is really important for me. Do not ruin this, okay?

12
00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:54.820
You don't belong here. Just get out! That's what you get.

13
00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:06.140
This contract is mine to give or take away as I see fit.

14
00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.140
Don't be ridiculous. This is insane. Who do you think you are?

15
00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.140
Yeah, put that down. You have no idea what you're doing.

16
00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.140
Security? She's lost her mind. This is a disaster!

17
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:24.329
Ben, this contract was supposed to be my birthday present to you, but since you clearly don't deserve it.
