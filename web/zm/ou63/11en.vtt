1
00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:06.719
Mr. Shepherd, I apologize for this whole mess, but I can assure you this woman has tricked you.

2
00:00:06.719 --> 00:00:11.140
Tricked? Why don't you answer a question yourself?

3
00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:16.579
What was my name before we got married?

4
00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:18.579
Laura Lewis, right?

5
00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:22.019
Lewis Group? The financial giants?

6
00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:26.019
There's no way a Lewis is connected to this.

7
00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:28.019
That's crazy.

8
00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.020
There's no way he related to the Lewis family name. That's absurd.

9
00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.340
It's absurd.

10
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.979
Society errors wouldn't waste a time in Maplewood.

11
00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:42.979
Yeah. Yeah, it's a lie. It's a lie. This woman was a waitress when I met her.

12
00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:50.100
Even if I'd saved her from a robbery two years ago, she's nothing special. She only married me out of gratitude.

13
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.100
I was just a waitress. How convenient for your story, Ben?

14
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.100
First time I met her, she wasn't even a waitress at the diner.

15
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.099
Okay, listen up, everybody. When I met her, I'd only just started my business.

16
00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:08.099
Mm-hmm. Now look at me. I'm signing multi-million dollar contracts.

17
00:01:08.099 --> 00:01:11.129
Look at her. Still just a cleaner.

18
00:01:11.129 --> 00:01:17.129
Mr. Shepherd, that woman is my son's ex-wife. She's doing all this out of spite.

19
00:01:17.129 --> 00:01:19.129
She's lying, Mr. Shepherd.

20
00:01:19.129 --> 00:01:23.760
She's just a cleaning lady for your business, isn't she?

21
00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:30.140
Let's make something clear. I was the one behind Harrison Group's success.

22
00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:36.879
I used my resources to help my ex-husband, but all he saw me as was the maid.

23
00:01:36.879 --> 00:01:41.879
Don't lie. You were never good enough for Ben when you married him. Oops.

24
00:01:41.879 --> 00:01:46.879
That roof was built with lies. Cathy, you never respected me.

25
00:01:46.879 --> 00:01:53.260
And Ben, dumping me the second you thought you were successful on your own, and the cheating.

26
00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:58.090
I think you're bringing the wrong person.

27
00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.090
You were not good enough for Ben then, and you're certainly not good enough for him now.

28
00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:08.219
If you'd prefer to believe a liar's story, then the truth, Cathy.

29
00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:16.300
Consider this my resignation from the Harrison's. From everything.

30
00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:22.780
Wait, wait, wait. Laura, I think you can just walk in here and then ruin everything, and then just walk out like nothing happened?

31
00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:28.780
I don't think so. You're a cleaner. You're a cleaner that cleans toilets. Nobody cares about you.

32
00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.900
Cleaning toilets or not, at least I have my self-respect.

33
00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:39.800
I don't need a fancy title or a rich husband to feel important.

34
00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:47.009
No, I think there has been some sort of misunderstanding. I think all jobs are important, right, Mom?

35
00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:54.639
But I don't think that a janitor should have some sort of influence over a deal as big as this.

36
00:02:54.639 --> 00:03:04.900
A janitor? Well, why don't we ask Miss Smith exactly how she landed that collaboration with Jeffrey?

37
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.120
You did claim to have been the one that secured the deal, weren't you, Miss Smith?

38
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:17.120
Mr. Shepherd, it's all a lie. This woman, Laura, she's just a gold digger trying to trick you.

39
00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.599
I...but, well...

40
00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:26.599
A lie, you say. Miss Smith, I believe you mentioned securing this contract for Harrison's room, but I don't recognize you.

41
00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:28.949
Is this true, Miss Smith?

42
00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:33.620
Miss Lewis has helped me on several occasions.

43
00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.620
This contract was my way of showing my appreciation.

44
00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.159
The contract. I mean, Laura tore it up.

45
00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:46.159
So, can't we just print another one and get this signing ceremony underway?

46
00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:48.159
Repainted, Mr. Harrison.

47
00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:53.159
Perhaps you haven't been paying attention without Miss Lewis involved.

48
00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:57.219
I wouldn't even consider partnering with your company.

49
00:03:57.219 --> 00:04:02.659
Today, I want to make it clear.

50
00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:06.659
Shepherd Group has no plans to partner with Harrison Group in the future.

51
00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:13.060
Miss Smith, you lied to us. You destroyed everything.

52
00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.180
No, it's a misunderstanding. I can explain.

53
00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:22.180
Lewis, Lewis family group, this can't be.

54
00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.180
Believe what you want, Ben.

55
00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:29.240
Lewis Group will be holding a massive investment meeting later this week.

56
00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:35.240
Three of our vice presidents will be here in Maplewood, and I'm sure you can ask them

57
00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.240
if you still have any doubts about who.

58
00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.290
Bye.

59
00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.290
Everyone, listen to me.

60
00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:48.019
Shepherd Group will not be partnering with Harrison Group.

61
00:04:48.019 --> 00:04:54.019
A man who can keep his vows to his wife cannot be trusted to keep his ward on the contract.

62
00:04:54.019 --> 00:04:57.180
He's already sober, Harrison.

63
00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.180
Everyone here deserves to see the truth.

64
00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:05.709
Miss Lewis, shall we take this conversation, husband?

65
00:05:05.709 --> 00:05:13.980
Mom!

66
00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:14.980
Someone get a doctor!

67
00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:15.980
Mom!

68
00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:18.139
It seems you're an SDK.

69
00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:21.649
Quite the term, Mr. Shepherd.

70
00:05:21.649 --> 00:05:25.709
Indeed. Perhaps he's best to live them to it.

71
00:05:25.709 --> 00:05:41.019
This is not all on me.

72
00:05:41.019 --> 00:05:44.149
Not on you. I was trying to help.

73
00:05:44.149 --> 00:05:48.339
She cheated on you with Shepherd. Flaunted they're a fair.

74
00:05:48.339 --> 00:05:51.600
Exactly. And those dresses?

75
00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.600
Who could afford those in a janitor's salary?

76
00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.600
Miss Smith, how could you do this?

77
00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:00.709
We trusted you completely.

78
00:06:00.709 --> 00:06:04.810
I've been the deal. I had no idea Shepherd would fall for Gora.

79
00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:06.810
She's a liar.

80
00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:10.810
Oh, stop it, Amber. You lied to us just as much as she did.

81
00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:13.810
Lied? You're on my side.

82
00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:15.810
And anyways, I have a plan.

83
00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:18.839
The Shepherd's are no one special.

84
00:06:18.839 --> 00:06:22.839
We can expose Laura in all her lives, don't national.

85
00:06:22.839 --> 00:06:24.839
We can make ourselves a household name.

86
00:06:24.839 --> 00:06:30.339
Now if you excuse me, I have a very important phone call to you.

87
00:06:30.339 --> 00:06:40.829
Shepherd, thank you as well for standing up.

88
00:06:40.829 --> 00:06:43.829
It's all right, Laura. You deserve the credit for all your hard work.

89
00:06:43.829 --> 00:06:46.829
Can I ask you something? Do you have any place to stay tonight?

90
00:06:46.829 --> 00:06:48.149
Maybe a hotel?

91
00:06:48.149 --> 00:06:52.149
Don't worry about me, Mr. Shepherd. I hope we find.

92
00:06:52.149 --> 00:06:54.439
Excuse me, you can just drop me out.

93
00:06:54.439 --> 00:06:58.439
Actually, Laura. Actually, Laura. There is something else.

94
00:06:58.439 --> 00:07:03.759
Would you consider your girl for dinner sometime? Just casually, of course.

95
00:07:03.759 --> 00:07:06.759
Mr. Shepherd, are you asking me out?

96
00:07:07.759 --> 00:07:09.759
Please, call me Brian.

97
00:07:09.759 --> 00:07:15.870
Yes. Technically, you're single now.

98
00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:26.339
Yes, that may be true, but going out with a newly divorced ex-cleaner isn't exactly.

99
00:07:26.339 --> 00:07:32.009
Proper? Laura? I don't give a damn about appearances.

100
00:07:32.009 --> 00:07:36.009
Tonight, I saw your intelligence and your strength.

101
00:07:36.009 --> 00:07:41.449
Those are qualities I truly admire. So what do you say?

102
00:07:41.449 --> 00:07:50.379
Dinner. Just shoot people getting to know each other.

103
00:07:50.379 --> 00:07:55.199
I'm sorry, Mr. Shepherd. I actually have another appointment.

104
00:07:55.199 --> 00:08:00.240
Wait, Laura. Just here is fine.

105
00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:09.610
Laura, who is it? Laura, wait!

106
00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:14.060
Jason, find out who owns that car and do it fast.

107
00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:23.740
Ian Lewis, who is this?

108
00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:31.019
Mr. Lewis, I'm sorry for the late call, but I believe I have some urgent information about your family.

109
00:08:31.019 --> 00:08:34.019
I don't know who you are, Miss Smith.

110
00:08:34.019 --> 00:08:36.019
How did you get this number?

111
00:08:36.019 --> 00:08:38.149
Don't worry about that right now.

112
00:08:38.149 --> 00:08:44.860
I believe I know someone impersonating Laura Lewis. Someone I know very well.

113
00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:49.860
It's amazing, my niece. And where is this fake Laura?

114
00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:55.860
Right here in Maplewood. And let me tell you, she's causing quite a scene.

115
00:08:55.860 --> 00:09:04.460
What is she doing exactly? And more to the point, what do you want from me?

116
00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:08.460
In the next few days, the Lewis group will hold an investment meeting, right?

117
00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:11.419
I want to meet with the vice presidents.

118
00:09:11.419 --> 00:09:13.419
All will be revealed then.

119
00:09:13.419 --> 00:09:20.580
Very well. I'll have my secretary arrange a meeting, but be warned if this is a waste of my time.

120
00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:23.580
It won't be. Trust me, Mr. Lewis.

121
00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:24.929
Thank you, Miss.

122
00:09:24.929 --> 00:09:39.690
That little rascal, Laura. I wonder what she's up to now.

123
00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:45.929
That car belongs to Mr. Yeats, the Lewis family father.

124
00:09:45.929 --> 00:09:52.500
The Lewis family. That's interesting. Could she be connected to them somehow?

125
00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:55.679
I'm not sure.

126
00:09:55.679 --> 00:09:59.679
Ryan! There you are. I've missed you.

127
00:09:59.679 --> 00:10:00.679
Boy.

128
00:10:00.679 --> 00:10:03.190
What are you doing?

129
00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:05.350
Boy, what are you doing here?

130
00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:08.929
What do you mean? Can't I visit the man I love?

131
00:10:08.929 --> 00:10:11.500
We ended things for a reason.

132
00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:15.500
It was just one teensy mistake. I was a little bit tipsy.

133
00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:17.700
Wasn't everyone deserve a second chance?

134
00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:20.700
It's a mistake, you said. You cheated on me.

135
00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:26.500
Is this your new thing?

136
00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:32.429
Extivorcy used to clean floors by the couch, you say?

137
00:10:32.429 --> 00:10:36.559
Look, my relationship with her is none of your business.

138
00:10:36.559 --> 00:10:39.559
And don't you dare talk about her like that.

139
00:10:39.559 --> 00:10:41.559
Please.

140
00:10:41.559 --> 00:10:45.559
An ex-cleaner turns social climber latching onto a wealthy businessman.

141
00:10:45.559 --> 00:10:47.559
It's a classic story.

142
00:10:47.559 --> 00:10:50.659
That's enough. I've got the hell out of my office.

143
00:10:50.659 --> 00:10:56.100
I want to be careful, Brian. Duke Industries still holds a lot of weight in Maplewood.

144
00:10:56.100 --> 00:11:00.740
If you want Shepherd Group to stay afloat, you ought to be more careful.

145
00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:13.029
Seems like you've got more on your plate than Laura's secrets now.

146
00:11:13.029 --> 00:11:17.029
This is it. The Lewis Group Vice President are on the top floor.

147
00:11:17.029 --> 00:11:22.029
Once I'm done speaking with them, I'll have Ben's company rolling in business investments.

148
00:11:22.029 --> 00:11:26.019
I'll go speak with them first and then I'll introduce you.

149
00:11:26.019 --> 00:11:29.019
Well, well, well. Look who it is.

150
00:11:29.019 --> 00:11:32.019
What a surprise. Did Brian teach you already?

151
00:11:32.019 --> 00:11:36.019
That's none of your business.

152
00:11:36.019 --> 00:11:37.019
Now, move aside, please.

153
00:11:37.019 --> 00:11:41.019
Laura, just what do you think you're doing? You street rat.

154
00:11:41.019 --> 00:11:44.019
You really think you can just ruin my events again? Haven't you ruined my life enough?

155
00:11:44.019 --> 00:11:45.019
Don't you have any shame?

156
00:11:45.019 --> 00:11:49.179
If you'll excuse me, I have an important meeting to get to.

157
00:11:49.179 --> 00:11:55.179
Oh, the nerves. After everything you've done, you think you can just waltz in here and manipulate them too?

158
00:11:55.179 --> 00:11:57.179
Seriously?

159
00:11:57.179 --> 00:12:01.179
I think you need to reconsider exactly who's manipulating who here.

160
00:12:01.179 --> 00:12:05.179
Oh, that's gold. You really think that they're gonna let you in, Laura?

161
00:12:05.179 --> 00:12:09.179
Please, you're no one compared to me. You don't deserve to be here.

162
00:12:09.179 --> 00:12:14.179
The only ones who don't belong here are you three.

163
00:12:14.179 --> 00:12:20.379
And you, idiot, believing every lie that she tells you, wake up, Ben.

164
00:12:20.379 --> 00:12:24.379
Oh, Laura. Laura, come on. Why do you always pull this on me?

165
00:12:24.379 --> 00:12:28.379
I mean, seriously. Can't you just let me enjoy one of my events for once?

166
00:12:28.379 --> 00:12:29.500
I know what this is.

167
00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:36.779
Oh, shut your trap. Amber spoke directly with the CEO.

168
00:12:36.779 --> 00:12:39.779
He invited her to meet with the VPs before the main meeting.

169
00:12:39.779 --> 00:12:43.779
Yeah, Amber got me a partnership with the Lewis Group.

170
00:12:43.779 --> 00:12:46.779
And I'm like some people, I have a real invitation.

171
00:12:46.779 --> 00:12:54.870
Wow. Before you all start celebrating, why don't you take a look at this?

172
00:12:54.870 --> 00:13:01.139
Oh, that's rich. You may have Brian Shepherd fooled, but you can't fool me.

173
00:13:01.139 --> 00:13:05.139
I spoke to Ian Lewis himself, CEO of Lewis Group.

174
00:13:05.139 --> 00:13:09.139
Speaking of Brian, where is he right now?

175
00:13:09.139 --> 00:13:14.139
You mean my uncle? Ian, don't be ridiculous.

176
00:13:14.139 --> 00:13:18.139
Ian Lewis personally gave me this invitation himself.

177
00:13:18.139 --> 00:13:23.690
And besides, this looks fake. She's a liar.

178
00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:28.389
This is a personal invitation from Mr. Yates himself.

179
00:13:28.389 --> 00:13:33.389
It grants me access to the VIP elevator, which leads straight to the vice presidential suite.

180
00:13:33.389 --> 00:13:37.389
She's lying. They don't have a VIP elevator in this hotel.

181
00:13:37.389 --> 00:13:44.750
They're a special elevator for VIPs in this hotel.

182
00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:46.750
Not that I know her.

183
00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:48.820
See? She's lying.

184
00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:51.820
There you have it, Laura. Even the hotel staff can spot a fake.

185
00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:54.820
Go on, get lost before things get worse.

186
00:13:54.820 --> 00:14:00.799
Here. Take this one. Leave me to the vice presidents.

187
00:14:00.799 --> 00:14:04.799
You have no idea what you just did.

188
00:14:04.799 --> 00:14:09.059
There be consequences.

189
00:14:09.059 --> 00:14:15.500
Besides, if you have this relationship with Ian Lewis that you claim to have,

190
00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:20.700
why don't you just ask him to get the two of them an invitation?

191
00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:22.700
Security. Security. We need this woman removed immediately.

192
00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:26.700
She is harassing me. We're done with your game, Laura. You're just a fraud.

193
00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:28.700
Man, place me. What?

194
00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:34.029
Hold on. Brian Shepard?

195
00:14:34.029 --> 00:14:38.289
You think money buys you the right to walk all over people while it doesn't?

196
00:14:38.289 --> 00:14:41.289
Yeah. Wasn't enough to kick us out of Maple. What was it, huh?

197
00:14:41.289 --> 00:14:45.289
What other plans do you have to destroy this time? Okay, you're out?

198
00:14:45.289 --> 00:14:48.289
After a while you did to Laura, you had it coming.

199
00:14:48.289 --> 00:14:51.289
Don't play dumb. You know exactly what's been happening here.

200
00:14:51.289 --> 00:14:57.289
How long has this little affair been going on? You've been sleeping with her since she was married to my son.

201
00:14:57.289 --> 00:15:04.179
Hold on a second. And the fair? You think Laura and I? You people are unbelievable.

202
00:15:04.179 --> 00:15:11.360
Mr. Carter, get down here ASAP. We have a situation.

203
00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:14.519
Well, you think you can just boss the manager around now? Is that it?

204
00:15:14.519 --> 00:15:17.519
We'll stick around and watch you crash and burn.

205
00:15:17.519 --> 00:15:20.519
Miss Lewis, apologies for the delay. How can I help you this evening?

206
00:15:20.519 --> 00:15:24.519
Thank you, Mr. Carter, for getting down here so quickly.

207
00:15:24.519 --> 00:15:27.519
It seems there's a misunderstanding.

208
00:15:27.519 --> 00:15:30.519
These people don't think that I belong here.

209
00:15:30.519 --> 00:15:33.519
Well, Mr. Carter, I can assure you, this woman is a cleaner.

210
00:15:33.519 --> 00:15:39.519
A cleaner nonsense. I personally agree to Miss Lewis upon her arrival in Maplewood three years ago.

211
00:15:39.519 --> 00:15:48.740
Exactly. Lucas Group, my company, has some major investments planned here in Maplewood.

212
00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:52.740
I was just here investigating potential business opportunities.

213
00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:56.740
No, this woman doesn't know the difference between business and a hole in the ground.

214
00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:59.740
She's been this way since my son divorced her. She's insane.

215
00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:03.740
Actually, I met Laura three years ago at the coffee shop.

216
00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:07.779
She helped secure a profitable investment for Shepherd Group.

217
00:16:07.779 --> 00:16:12.870
No, it's a lie. Mr. Shepherd, she's tricking you too.

218
00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:21.700
You know, it's exhausting trying to argue with people who forget who helped them.

219
00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:24.889
Mr. Carter, would you mind showing me to the VIP elevator?

220
00:16:25.889 --> 00:16:27.889
Wait, is that why you're covering for her?

221
00:16:27.889 --> 00:16:29.889
Huh? Because of the affair, because she slept with you?

222
00:16:29.889 --> 00:16:33.889
Excuse me. Who are you and how day you speak to Miss Lewis that way?

223
00:16:33.889 --> 00:16:34.889
No, this... she frets.

224
00:16:34.889 --> 00:16:37.889
That's enough. Have you ever embarrassed yourself enough?

225
00:16:37.889 --> 00:16:41.889
This is Lewis Group property. Behave or I'll call security.

226
00:16:41.889 --> 00:16:44.889
But she doesn't even have a VIP entrance access.

227
00:16:44.889 --> 00:16:46.889
She shouldn't be here.

228
00:16:46.889 --> 00:16:51.980
Since you're having trouble understanding them, let me make it clear.

229
00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:54.980
This hotel is owned by the Lewis family.

230
00:16:54.980 --> 00:17:00.240
It's mine to come or go as I please.

231
00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:05.250
Thank you for stepping in right now.

232
00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:09.630
I owe you one. We'll talk about this later.

233
00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:15.019
Well, it seems divorcing a powerful woman wasn't the best decision I've ever seen.

234
00:17:15.019 --> 00:17:28.680
Excuse me, Vice Presidents. I'm Amber Smith,

235
00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:31.680
General Manager of the Lewis Group Maplewood Branch.

236
00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:34.680
I believe Ian Lewis told you about our meeting today.

237
00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:41.809
Maplewood Branch. Our records don't show any Maplewood Branch, is it?

238
00:17:41.809 --> 00:17:44.809
Are you sure you haven't gotten something mixed up?

239
00:17:44.809 --> 00:17:54.319
Ian Lewis, Mr. Lewis, reassured me that today we would discuss, well, expansion plans.

240
00:17:54.319 --> 00:17:57.319
Expansion plans? Miss Smith?

241
00:17:57.319 --> 00:18:01.319
A decision like that wouldn't be taken without board approval.

242
00:18:01.319 --> 00:18:04.319
And frankly, we haven't heard anything about it.

243
00:18:04.319 --> 00:18:08.789
But, Ian Lewis assured me that...

244
00:18:08.789 --> 00:18:12.789
Miss Smith, we have a very important guest arriving soon.

245
00:18:12.789 --> 00:18:15.789
Perhaps you'd like to schedule a follow-up meeting with one of our staff?

246
00:18:15.789 --> 00:18:17.789
Maybe I can stay for this guest and offer some local...

247
00:18:17.789 --> 00:18:22.789
Miss Smith, we'd like you to leave. If you don't, we'll call security.

248
00:18:22.789 --> 00:18:31.369
Hey, stop there. These elevators are VIP only.

249
00:18:31.369 --> 00:18:32.369
Hey, please.

250
00:18:32.369 --> 00:18:43.619
Of course. My apologies.

251
00:18:43.619 --> 00:18:47.619
Vice Presidents, it's so good to see all of you again.

252
00:18:47.619 --> 00:18:50.619
Miss Lewis, it's been too long.

253
00:18:50.619 --> 00:18:53.619
Your return is a lifesaver, Miss Lewis.

254
00:18:53.619 --> 00:18:59.619
The Lewis group has floundered under your uncle's, well, shall we say, unconventional leadership.

255
00:18:59.619 --> 00:19:03.660
The board are begging you to come back, Miss Lewis.

256
00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:10.579
Well, please sit. Yes, well, it is time for me to get my career back on track.

257
00:19:10.579 --> 00:19:15.619
We've got a meeting planned, a big one, in just a few days.

258
00:19:15.619 --> 00:19:19.650
Local powerhouses and smaller players, too.

259
00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:22.650
They'll all be there in the one spot.

260
00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:26.650
Miss Lewis, we met with an Amber Smith.

261
00:19:26.650 --> 00:19:33.650
She claimed your uncle appointed her general manager of a Maplewood branch for the Lewis group.

262
00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:37.650
She said that. Did she? Well, Miss Smith is a liar.

263
00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:40.650
There is no Maplewood branch, at least not yet.

264
00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:43.650
She lied so blatantly, it was unbelievable.

265
00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:51.140
But, don't worry. I found a much more suitable partner, Shepherd group.

266
00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:52.140
Shepherd group?

267
00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:53.140
Not even good.

268
00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:55.140
Their rise to a public company has been impressive.

269
00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:58.779
Do you have anything to do with that?

270
00:19:58.779 --> 00:20:03.069
So, what happens now with this Amber Smith?

271
00:20:03.069 --> 00:20:10.319
Oh, don't worry about Amber. I've got plans for her.

272
00:20:10.319 --> 00:20:14.759
Miss Lewis, consider this.

273
00:20:14.759 --> 00:20:19.079
You're official invitation to the legend. Promise.

274
00:20:19.079 --> 00:20:21.359
Cheers.

275
00:20:21.359 --> 00:20:22.359
Cheers.

276
00:20:22.359 --> 00:20:34.259
Don't worry. What are you talking about? No, come on.

277
00:20:34.259 --> 00:20:39.359
I'm Amber Smith. I'm the Lewis group manager of Maplewood branch. What are you doing? These are my guests.

278
00:20:39.359 --> 00:20:41.359
That's right. Tell him who we are.

279
00:20:41.359 --> 00:20:43.359
Yes, we were waiting for Miss Smith.

280
00:20:43.359 --> 00:20:50.700
Lewis group Maplewood branch? No such thing, ma'am. And frankly, I'm not interested in your act.

281
00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:53.700
Oh, of course. Laura.

282
00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:57.700
She's probably sleeping with the manager as well. That's how she gets away with everything.

283
00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:02.700
You underestimate her, Kathy. She's probably sleeping with all three vice presidents.

284
00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:05.829
No way a girl like her could get into a hotel like this.

285
00:21:05.829 --> 00:21:08.829
Careful with your words. Both of you.

286
00:21:08.829 --> 00:21:12.019
Accusations like that can get you in serious trouble.

287
00:21:12.019 --> 00:21:15.690
Look who can't even get into a meeting.

288
00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:19.690
Whilst I secure three with all the vice presidents.

289
00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:22.690
And let's not forget the mystery guests that they're bringing to Maplewood.

290
00:21:22.690 --> 00:21:26.069
Looks like she used you and tossed you aside.

291
00:21:26.069 --> 00:21:30.069
Use me? I like some people. I know mine being helpful.

292
00:21:30.069 --> 00:21:35.069
You're so stupid. She threw you away like yesterday's trash.

293
00:21:35.069 --> 00:21:39.069
Don't worry, Brian. You deserve better. And let's not forget.

294
00:21:39.069 --> 00:21:46.069
I'm the new Maplewood branch manager of Lewis group, appointed by the CEO of Lewis group themselves, Ian Lewis.

295
00:21:46.069 --> 00:21:50.519
You branch manager, huh? Interesting.

296
00:21:50.519 --> 00:21:53.519
Laura Lewis, what are you doing? You're get out of here.

297
00:21:53.519 --> 00:21:56.519
You claim to be the mystery guest?

298
00:21:56.519 --> 00:22:02.519
Don't play games, Laura. I was formally invited by Lewis group themselves to the investment meeting.

299
00:22:02.519 --> 00:22:07.519
Only the top companies get those. Looks like you're all out of luck.

300
00:22:07.519 --> 00:22:10.059
Is that so? Well then.

301
00:22:10.059 --> 00:22:13.349
There seems to be a misunderstanding.

302
00:22:13.349 --> 00:22:19.740
You see, I'm not sure if you know Miss Smith, but Lewis group is my company.

303
00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:25.529
And I decide who goes to the meetings. Escort them out.

304
00:22:25.529 --> 00:22:27.660
Your visit is over.

305
00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:30.069
This way, please.

306
00:22:30.069 --> 00:22:32.740
I'm not leaving.

307
00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:36.740
Move. We're not leaving. I get. Move. No, no, no. We're not going now.

308
00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:39.309
This isn't over, Laura. You see.

309
00:22:39.309 --> 00:22:55.049
Thanks for waiting, Ren. Thank you for defending me. I really...

310
00:22:55.049 --> 00:23:00.660
Are you coming to the meeting?

311
00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:04.019
Yes, but it's going to be tricky.

312
00:23:04.019 --> 00:23:13.500
Why? I'm sure that Shepherd Group got an invitation.

313
00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:18.000
Yes, Laura. There's something you should know.

314
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.440
Yes. Is this about Ben?

315
00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:28.700
Because I can assure you that he won't cause any problems. He won't even get past security.

316
00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:33.140
Laura, it's not Ben. It's someone else.

317
00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:37.670
Someone's causing problems for Shepherd Group?

318
00:23:37.670 --> 00:23:47.579
Yes. Her name is Chloe Duke. She is daughter of the Duke family.

319
00:23:47.579 --> 00:23:57.650
She's my ex-fiance. And let's say things didn't end so well between us.

320
00:23:57.650 --> 00:24:04.720
And let's just say we didn't end things so well.

321
00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:09.099
And for some reason, she's having a hard time moving on.

322
00:24:09.099 --> 00:24:16.000
And you think that she's going to cause problems at the meeting,

323
00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:23.710
for out of jealousy?

324
00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:27.289
There's a possibility. She's kind of jealous.

325
00:24:27.289 --> 00:24:32.759
Well, for all the more reason for you to be there.

326
00:24:32.759 --> 00:24:35.660
Besides, I'll be there too.

327
00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:43.210
Laura, would you consider being, I guess, at the meeting?

328
00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:48.940
What? Are you worried that this Chloe's going to cause problems for me too?

329
00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:55.000
Maybe a little. But mostly, I want to show them we're team.

330
00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000
It's a very kind offer, Mr. Shepherd.

331
00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:08.960
Laura, I just want to be by your side.

332
00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:26.599
I appreciate your honesty. And right now, I'm just not...

333
00:25:26.599 --> 00:25:32.180
I just don't really have romance on my mind right now, just with...

334
00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:34.900
Go on.

335
00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:40.200
It's okay. I just want to be a...

336
00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:47.589
And if Chloe tries anything, you won't face her alone.

337
00:25:47.589 --> 00:25:51.829
There's just one thing.

338
00:25:51.829 --> 00:25:52.829
What is it?

339
00:25:52.829 --> 00:26:08.589
A formal dress.

340
00:26:08.589 --> 00:26:11.589
She doesn't belong here. This is a private store.

341
00:26:11.589 --> 00:26:17.589
Excuse me. We need some assistance. I'm looking for a very particular dress.

342
00:26:17.589 --> 00:26:22.759
It's beautiful.

343
00:26:22.759 --> 00:26:23.759
It is.

344
00:26:23.759 --> 00:26:25.759
I'll try this one on.

345
00:26:25.759 --> 00:26:28.759
Don't bother with her. She can't afford anything here.

346
00:26:28.759 --> 00:26:32.759
She's just a cleaner. She doesn't deserve to shop you. She has no money.

347
00:26:32.759 --> 00:26:38.329
Exactly. I mean, what are you doing here? Can you just leave me alone?

348
00:26:38.329 --> 00:26:41.329
I wouldn't bat an eyelash if you just disappeared.

349
00:26:41.329 --> 00:26:43.329
I'm here for retail therapy.

350
00:26:43.329 --> 00:26:45.329
Oh, please.

351
00:26:45.329 --> 00:26:47.329
This store is for the A-list only.

352
00:26:47.329 --> 00:26:49.329
Not some cheap skate like you.

353
00:26:49.329 --> 00:26:52.329
It says that we want her barched into my marriage.

354
00:26:52.329 --> 00:26:54.329
Hey, show some respect.

355
00:26:54.329 --> 00:26:58.650
Take the cool Laura. Just think she can buy anything she wants with someone else's money.

356
00:26:58.650 --> 00:27:03.650
I would have asked you, but without me, I'm sure they're already booked.

357
00:27:03.650 --> 00:27:05.650
Please. Come on. We'll take the dress.

358
00:27:05.650 --> 00:27:08.650
This particular dress is not for sale.

359
00:27:08.650 --> 00:27:11.059
What do you mean you don't sell it?

360
00:27:11.059 --> 00:27:13.059
I want it. Name your price.

361
00:27:13.059 --> 00:27:15.059
It's not about the price, man.

362
00:27:15.059 --> 00:27:19.059
This one was custom-made from Miss Lewis, the Lewis Group Heiress.

363
00:27:19.059 --> 00:27:21.059
The entire brand belongs to her.

364
00:27:21.059 --> 00:27:25.059
This beautiful dress is for display purposes only. Thank you.

365
00:27:25.059 --> 00:27:27.420
It wouldn't suit you anyway, Amber.

366
00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:31.420
What are you talking about? Of course it would suit her. It would fit her just fine.

367
00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:35.539
And if it wouldn't fit me, it certainly wouldn't fit your chunky self either.

368
00:27:35.539 --> 00:27:38.539
Well, buying the whole store, allow me to purchase this dress.
