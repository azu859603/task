00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
Oh, please. Don't you know that this store belongs to Lewis Group?

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.759
We wouldn't sell it to someone like you.

3
00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.320
Amber, you're not even a branch manager yet. You don't get to speak on behalf of Lewis Group.

4
00:00:11.199 --> 00:00:14.160
Could you please tell me more about this dress?

5
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.480
Of course. It was custom-made for Laura Lewis,

6
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.280
harassed to the Lewis Group fortune, and stitched in Italy, naturally.

7
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.690
And apparently there are many more like at this point.

8
00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.609
High-end stores and museums around the world from her private collection.

9
00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.000
Laura, do you like this dress?

10
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:40.719
Of course. It's custom-made for me. I'm just here to take what's already mine.

11
00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:45.439
You can't be serious. There must be millions of Laura Lewis's out there in the world.

12
00:00:45.439 --> 00:00:51.679
Fine, fine. If it's not for sale, can't I at least try it on? It would look incredible on me.

13
00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:56.399
Miss, this dress is very delicate. If I may be frank,

14
00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.280
I don't think this would fit you properly.

15
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.719
Are you calling me fat?

16
00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.930
Actually, what a second thought. Why don't we just buy the whole brand? How's that sound?

17
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.890
Sir, are you serious? You would just buy the entire brand for one dress.

18
00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:18.049
This brand is worth at least $50 million and to buy it for a waitress?

19
00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:19.569
Are you out of your mind?

20
00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:23.090
Yes. You see, even if you had the money, they wouldn't sell it to you.

21
00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.700
Just one second. Yes. This is Brian Shepherd.

22
00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.700
CEO Shepherd Group.

23
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.620
I'd like to speak with you ahead of work positions.

24
00:01:33.489 --> 00:01:40.209
I'm interested in purchasing your high-fashioned brand. What?
