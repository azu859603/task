00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
I want the two of these out of my store.

2
00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:03.580
Of course.

3
00:00:05.559 --> 00:00:06.459
Oh, come on.

4
00:00:06.459 --> 00:00:09.000
Sir, ma'am, I'm afraid I have to ask you to leave?

5
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.720
Well, we're not leaving, okay?

6
00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:11.759
Hey, hey!

7
00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.009
It's an over, Laura!

8
00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.710
Could I try the dress on now?

9
00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:17.710
Of course, Miss Lewis.

10
00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:26.530
You just follow me.

11
00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:32.600
Miss Lewis, this dress really was made for you.

12
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.829
Laura, you look breathtaking in this dress.

13
00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:40.259
Brian, why would you do all of this?

14
00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.420
Oh, with this, for me?

15
00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:50.560
Laura, because you deserve everything beautiful in the world,

16
00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.200
and that includes this dress.

17
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.399
Thank you.

18
00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:59.299
Will you give us a chance to see where things could go?

19
00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:02.609
I need a moment.

20
00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:08.359
Perhaps we could talk some more about this after the investment meeting?

21
00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:11.079
Does that mean it could be a yes?

22
00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:12.079
Maybe.
