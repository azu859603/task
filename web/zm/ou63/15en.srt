1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:20,079
Well, well, well, look, I decided to join the party, playing dress up again Laura.

2
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:24,160
One more, there's a respectful remark towards Laura, Ms. Smith, and you understand the meaning

3
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,160
of rude.

4
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,160
You've threatened my girlfriend in front of everyone?

5
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,160
For this, Ms. Goldigger.

6
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:36,020
You know Ben, I really cared about you, even after all the horrible things you said to

7
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:37,579
me after our divorce.

8
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:40,820
I knew the name of a great psychologist in New York.

9
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:46,939
Maybe the shrinks and maple wood aren't equipped to deal with your issues.

10
00:00:46,939 --> 00:00:47,939
Enough!

11
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:49,460
I've had enough of this drama.

12
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:50,460
Yeah, me too.

13
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,299
So I did again, and you regret it.

14
00:00:53,299 --> 00:00:56,509
I'll get the hell out of my face.

15
00:00:56,509 --> 00:00:58,509
Let's see if you two even make it past the door.

16
00:00:58,509 --> 00:01:01,369
Yeah.

17
00:01:01,369 --> 00:01:04,370
I'm sorry, Ms. Smith, but your name's not only guest list.

18
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:05,370
What?

19
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:06,930
That's impossible.

20
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:09,170
I was invited by the CEO himself.
