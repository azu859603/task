00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.700
There you are! How dare you steal my fiancee!

2
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:07.089
Looks like another relationship by the dust, Laura.

3
00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:09.890
Looks like stealing men. Is that how they lose?

4
00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:12.689
Get away from him! He's engaged to me!

5
00:00:12.689 --> 00:00:16.690
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hold your horses away. That ended a long time ago.

6
00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:22.190
Engaged to you. Everyone in Maplewood knows what you did to Brian.

7
00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.780
The relationship's history. That was just a little tip.

8
00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:31.910
You really think that could tear us apart? Don't you know who I am?

9
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.509
Don't pretend like you don't know.

10
00:00:34.509 --> 00:00:38.509
Oh, honey. She don't recognize royalty, let alone in Duke.

11
00:00:38.509 --> 00:00:43.979
She's just a maid. Remember? I don't have time for all this drama.

12
00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:47.829
Brian, let's head inside.

13
00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:53.259
Brian, how could you choose this cleaner over me?

14
00:00:53.259 --> 00:00:56.259
Can you humiliate me in front of all of Maplewood?

15
00:00:56.259 --> 00:01:00.920
There's nothing left to say going. Don't make this a scene, shall we?
