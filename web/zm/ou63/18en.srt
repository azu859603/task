1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,589
You okay Miss Duke?

2
00:00:02,589 --> 00:00:03,589
And you are?

3
00:00:03,589 --> 00:00:04,589
Amber Smith.

4
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:07,940
I'm the Maplewood branch manager of Lewis Group.

5
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:09,939
What branch? I've never heard of it.

6
00:00:09,939 --> 00:00:10,939
What do you want from me?

7
00:00:10,939 --> 00:00:12,939
That Laura!

8
00:00:12,939 --> 00:00:14,939
She tore up my invitation.

9
00:00:14,939 --> 00:00:15,939
Do you think you can get me inside?

10
00:00:15,939 --> 00:00:19,940
What? Your little manager title couldn't get you past the front door?

11
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:22,359
Please don't waste my time.

12
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:56,630
If I can't have Brian, neither can you.

13
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:59,950
The Duke family has more influence than you think.

14
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:04,750
Chloe, good to see you. I've been expecting you.

15
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:06,750
Uncle Jones, how are you?

16
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:10,170
I need your help with something.

17
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,170
What is it?

18
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:13,170
Anything for my little Chloe?

19
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,420
It's Brian.

20
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:18,420
Who's that woman? I thought you were.

21
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,420
She's a con woman.

22
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:22,650
She actually used to be a cleaner in his company.

23
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:23,650
What?

24
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:29,219
Are you saying Brian left you for a cleaner?

25
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:33,569
She's pretending to be a Lewis to get close to him.

26
00:01:33,569 --> 00:01:35,980
What are you planning?

27
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:37,980
I want to destroy Shepherd Group.
