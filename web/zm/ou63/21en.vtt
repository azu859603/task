00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.299
You know what, maybe you're right, Chloe.

2
00:00:02.299 --> 00:00:04.190
I'm ridiculous.

3
00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:06.190
Is that what you've been telling everyone?

4
00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:12.189
I'm sure that the Duke family still values cooperation, but...

5
00:00:12.189 --> 00:00:13.189
Wow.

6
00:00:13.189 --> 00:00:17.010
Did I underestimate your foolishness, Chloe?

7
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.510
You have no right to talk to Mr. Black Knight.

8
00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.510
That's enough. You don't get to talk here.

9
00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.510
You got mad, Shepard. You dare to go and get from Mr. Duke?

10
00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.510
In the same applies to everyone else here.

11
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.010
Anyone who insults Laura.

12
00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.969
Leave us with a black card.

13
00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.969
It's willing to offend the jig for her.

14
00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:36.969
What kind of job does she have?

15
00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:38.969
I want to be careful, Brian.

16
00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.969
Don't forget that this entire hotel chain is owned by the Lewis Group.

17
00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.969
Are you willing to get blacklisted for this public tantrum?

18
00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:47.969
The Lewis Group.

19
00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.969
Is it blacklisted to anyone, especially not?

20
00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.969
Shepard Group.
