00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.419
Lewis Group RS, you, don't make me laugh.

2
00:00:05.419 --> 00:00:09.660
Security, remove these two imposters from the premises.

3
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.179
Wait Uncle Jones, give Brian another chance.

4
00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:15.179
Choose, Brian.

5
00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.739
Me and the future you deserve, or this...

6
00:00:17.739 --> 00:00:21.079
Fraud.

7
00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:24.969
Gloie, I have everything I ever wanted.

8
00:00:24.969 --> 00:00:26.820
Right here.

9
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.660
In a wooden trade of all the power that looks on me.

10
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:37.060
Fine.

11
00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:38.859
Short the stock of the Shepherd Group.

12
00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:42.100
What?

13
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.060
You forced my hand, Brian.

14
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.140
Now Shepherd Group has ruined the Duke family.

15
00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.460
They can't be serious.

16
00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.219
Shepherd Group has doomed.

17
00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.259
Brian.

18
00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:54.799
You don't have to do this for me.

19
00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:55.990
Laura.

20
00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.909
Now we've never let anyone bully you.

21
00:00:58.909 --> 00:00:59.909
Let alone them.

22
00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:07.920
Thank you, Brian, for believing in me, for protecting me.

23
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:17.739
Now it's my turn to protect you.

24
00:01:17.739 --> 00:01:19.780
Listen carefully.

25
00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:25.260
I need you to protect the Shepherd Group stock at all costs.

26
00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.780
Don't let it drop, even one cent.

27
00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.420
Do you understand?

28
00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.569
Well, award-winning performance, Laura.

29
00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:38.739
But you can't possibly control the stock.

30
00:01:38.739 --> 00:01:42.859
Want to put your money where your mouth is, Gloie?

31
00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:54.780
If the Shepherd stock holds for the next five minutes, you owe me a public apology.
