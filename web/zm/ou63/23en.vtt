00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:06.900
Well, it looks like your five minutes is up.

2
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:13.580
Let's see how this shepherd stock is doing.

3
00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:14.619
What the?

4
00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:16.620
The shepherd group stock prices?

5
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.839
It's going up!

6
00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:19.839
This can't be happening.

7
00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:20.839
It must be a coincidence.

8
00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:29.410
Why didn't you short the stock like I asked?

9
00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.079
There was a huge investment.

10
00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:33.079
We couldn't compete.

11
00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:35.079
Shepherd stock prices being heavily supported.

12
00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:38.100
How did you do this?

13
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.320
Like I said, Chloe, I'm Laura Lewis.

14
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.320
Oh, you're not. You're just some clean out.

15
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.320
You don't have access to billions.

16
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.280
Well, I think it's time for my apology.
