1
00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:06.160
No, I think it's time for my apology. There is no way I'm apologizing to you

2
00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:10.099
If things were the other way, would you be so quick to forgive me?

3
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.800
Chloe the truth is

4
00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:21.379
Everyone here has seen you be a bully and a coward and now a

5
00:00:22.059 --> 00:00:24.059
sore

6
00:00:24.059 --> 00:00:26.350
This is so humiliating

7
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.149
How did she manage that? Maybe she really is a Lewis

8
00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:34.109
Apologize to Miss Lewis

9
00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:37.469
Shut up don't you dare talk about Miss Duke like that

10
00:00:38.369 --> 00:00:44.320
Don't forget the Duke from the on half of Maplewood. You know what it is. Let's get out of here

11
00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:47.619
hold on

12
00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:54.229
This is where I belong and that is my chair

13
00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.509
Can't go there. That is the VIP section

14
00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.750
Only those invited by the Lewis Group vice presidents get to sit there

15
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.390
Like I said, Chloe

16
00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:11.989
That's my seat

17
00:01:11.989 --> 00:01:14.989
Had a room of floating around a few days ago seems

18
00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:21.989
Miss Lewis caused quite a scene at a signing ceremony between her ex and mr. Shepherd

19
00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:28.469
Wasn't it? Are you planning another outburst Laura? Is this how you charm all you men? Shall we?

20
00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:30.810
My pleasure

21
00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.579
What are you doing?

22
00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:37.939
Let go. It doesn't matter what happened. I choose to stay but Laura sucked

23
00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.299
Don't be absurd. That seat is reserved for a very important guest

24
00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:50.659
Someone so esteemed even the vice presidents have to bow low

25
00:01:51.379 --> 00:01:54.950
And

26
00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.150
how

27
00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.069
Exactly mr. Jones

28
00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.230
Are you so sure that I'm

29
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.709
Not that esteemed guest

30
00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:06.310
Wait, that's Peter Young. It's actually a business affairs. Let me screw it

31
00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:11.259
That's Peter Young

32
00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:15.180
It decides what she wants to know. It's Chloe Duke head of Duke Industries

33
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.620
So glad you could join us. Why is everyone standing around? It's her

34
00:02:19.419 --> 00:02:26.780
She's making a huge scene trying to claim the VIP seats. It's embarrassing. That seats reserved for the Lewis Group VIP guest

35
00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.020
Specifically the family air

36
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.060
Please get off the stage

37
00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.500
Oh, yes

38
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:39.979
Mr. Young was it? I think I remember you you manage my family's investments

39
00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:43.639
Don't pretend like you know what's going on

40
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.740
Please get off the stage

41
00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.740
That seats reserved for the Lewis family air

42
00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.360
I need to make one thing

43
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.849
Crystal clear

44
00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:01.129
I am the heir of the Lewis family

45
00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.270
This is ridiculous

46
00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:06.469
You

47
00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:07.509
The Lewis heir

48
00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:09.750
Don't you know that Miss Lewis is a legend around here

49
00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.430
You must be out of your mind trusting a complete stranger like this

50
00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:14.629
Exactly

51
00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:19.990
We ran a background check on her and turns out she's just some cleaner that used to work for the Harrison group

52
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:23.590
Before that I can see her in my family's supermarket

53
00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:25.750
See Brian

54
00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.710
This is who you've been chasing after a liar and a cheat

55
00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:30.389
Security

56
00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:32.310
Get this imposter out of here

57
00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.150
And everyone here is a witness

58
00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.310
Why would any of you trust Laura?

59
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.759
If any of you

60
00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:40.840
Dares to harm her

61
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.319
You have to go through me first

62
00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:45.349
Brian she's just a nobody

63
00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:49.110
She's just someone that the Harrison group ditched

64
00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.030
They didn't even want her

65
00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.870
What exactly do you see in her?

66
00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.310
A sculpt imposter out of here

67
00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.229
Now

68
00:03:56.229 --> 00:04:04.229
Oh Peter

69
00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:05.590
Peter

70
00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.270
Do you have any idea what you're doing?

71
00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:09.639
He missed he hates

72
00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:11.000
I'm so glad you could join us

73
00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:14.680
Miss Lewis

74
00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:15.719
Sorry about the delay

75
00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:18.519
And for all the trouble you've had to put up with

76
00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:19.560
It's

77
00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.199
No

78
00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:21.879
Trouble mystery eights

79
00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:23.480
Luckily I haven't been alone

80
00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.759
I've had the great company of my very loyal

81
00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:29.740
friend

82
00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.000
Wait a minute

83
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.879
She's Miss Lewis

84
00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:32.680
Is this a joke?

85
00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:34.870
Mr. Young

86
00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.550
You're new to the Lewis group

87
00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:37.430
So

88
00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.829
I can understand why you wouldn't recognize Miss Lewis

89
00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.319
But you listen to lies without checking the facts

90
00:04:44.899 --> 00:04:46.579
And almost called the police

91
00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:49.160
Tell me

92
00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:50.360
Mr. Young

93
00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.579
Who put you up to this?

94
00:04:52.579 --> 00:04:54.579
Was it my uncle or the in-laws?

95
00:04:54.579 --> 00:04:58.649
Knew it

96
00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.339
Consider this your termination

97
00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:06.180
I get it now

98
00:05:06.899 --> 00:05:08.600
This is all an act

99
00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:09.000
Right

100
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.120
Chloe what are you doing?

101
00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.720
We still want to work with the Lewis family

102
00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:12.839
Where with them?

103
00:05:12.839 --> 00:05:13.480
Are you blind?

104
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.199
This woman is clearly having a fan with this old man

105
00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:18.920
That's enough young lady

106
00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.959
You've got no right to disrespect the head of the Lewis group

107
00:05:21.959 --> 00:05:25.300
Chloe

108
00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.139
I can't believe we're going through this again

109
00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:30.339
I think you need some professional help

110
00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.540
Maybe I could make you an appointment with a great psychiatrist

111
00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:34.740
Chloe

112
00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:35.459
That's not

113
00:05:35.459 --> 00:05:36.300
It's ridiculous

114
00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.060
If you were really the Lewis family heir

115
00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:38.860
You would have the ring

116
00:05:39.579 --> 00:05:41.100
So why don't you show it to everyone?

117
00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:42.620
Show us the ring

118
00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:47.610
Why don't you show that to everyone?

119
00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:49.529
Show us the ring

120
00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:50.490
Show us the ring

121
00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.050
Who are you to make demands of me?

122
00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.100
I don't answer to anyone but myself

123
00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:01.269
I don't need any of your validation

124
00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:09.939
Vice presidents

125
00:06:10.819 --> 00:06:12.980
I'm Chloe Duke of the Duke family

126
00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:14.819
This woman is an imposter

127
00:06:14.819 --> 00:06:15.459
Miss Lewis

128
00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:18.230
We apologize for the delay

129
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:20.470
And can't women sit there?

130
00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:24.310
This seat was always from Miss Lewis

131
00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:28.519
She's the special guest we've been waiting for

132
00:06:28.519 --> 00:06:30.040
The investment queen

133
00:06:30.759 --> 00:06:32.839
The real heir to Lewis group

134
00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:34.759
Laura Lewis

135
00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:36.839
She has a divorced host wife

136
00:06:36.839 --> 00:06:37.720
A janitor

137
00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:38.439
Where can she?

138
00:06:38.439 --> 00:06:39.560
She can't be it

139
00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:40.600
It's a lie I'm telling you

140
00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:41.240
It's a lie

141
00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.079
Do you think we'd lie?

142
00:06:43.959 --> 00:06:45.399
We run Lewis group

143
00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.240
Oh Chloe

144
00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:49.959
You assaulted me earlier

145
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
And you came to this meeting to what?

146
00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:54.779
Sabotage it

147
00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:58.139
You'll be hearing from our legal team

148
00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:02.009
Is this true Miss Dew?

149
00:07:02.569 --> 00:07:04.329
Did you try and sabotage this meeting?

150
00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:08.069
Yes, it's all true

151
00:07:08.069 --> 00:07:08.949
She fooled us all

152
00:07:09.509 --> 00:07:12.230
The Jews tricked us to keep Lewis group

153
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:13.430
out of maple words

154
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:15.350
and control everything themselves

155
00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:16.230
I had no idea

156
00:07:17.029 --> 00:07:18.230
But I'm on your side

157
00:07:19.449 --> 00:07:21.209
I can give you everything you need

158
00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:23.610
All the resources in maple words

159
00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:24.250
Miss Lewis

160
00:07:25.129 --> 00:07:26.490
How would you like us to deal with this?

161
00:07:28.019 --> 00:07:28.420
An eye

162
00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:30.220
For an eye

163
00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:35.220
Since Miss Duke here

164
00:07:36.019 --> 00:07:38.019
loves ruining things

165
00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:43.269
I'll target her precious Duke industries

166
00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:46.579
I want them bankrupt in 10 minutes

167
00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:48.180
You're bluffing

168
00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:49.939
You're nobody

169
00:07:49.939 --> 00:07:51.379
You'll always be a nobody

170
00:07:51.379 --> 00:07:52.660
And you can't touch me

171
00:07:53.259 --> 00:07:55.899
Then consider this a test

172
00:07:56.459 --> 00:07:56.860
Chloe

173
00:07:57.579 --> 00:08:00.060
I didn't need my family support with Shepherd

174
00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:01.980
and I certainly don't need it now

175
00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:02.379
Chloe

176
00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:05.220
You dug your own grave

177
00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:08.579
You think you can destroy Maplewood's leading family

178
00:08:08.579 --> 00:08:09.939
with just the Shepherd group?

179
00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:11.139
Please

180
00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:14.579
We'll see

181
00:08:21.589 --> 00:08:22.389
Slow down

182
00:08:22.389 --> 00:08:23.430
What are you talking about?

183
00:08:25.529 --> 00:08:25.769
No

184
00:08:27.529 --> 00:08:28.329
It's impossible

185
00:08:29.319 --> 00:08:29.879
Chloe

186
00:08:29.879 --> 00:08:30.680
What have you done?

187
00:08:31.399 --> 00:08:32.679
Years of hard work

188
00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:38.490
Just 40 minutes

189
00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:39.740
Two

190
00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:40.220
Well

191
00:08:40.779 --> 00:08:41.860
Chloe

192
00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:44.360
Isn't this what you wanted?

193
00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:46.840
To give me a little taste of destruction

194
00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:48.820
This is impossible

195
00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:50.330
It's impossible

196
00:08:51.259 --> 00:08:52.059
Chloe

197
00:08:52.059 --> 00:08:52.860
What have you done?

198
00:08:53.659 --> 00:08:54.860
The news is everywhere

199
00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:58.299
Shepherd's launched a full scale of salt on the stock market

200
00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:00.220
They're hammering our shares

201
00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:03.019
Are you sure it's just sharp?

202
00:09:03.019 --> 00:09:03.820
Yes

203
00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:07.340
Shareholders are dumping our stock like it's a hot potato

204
00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:09.659
We could go bankrupt

205
00:09:09.659 --> 00:09:11.019
You've ruined everything

206
00:09:11.019 --> 00:09:12.539
Don't worry Mr. Duke

207
00:09:12.539 --> 00:09:15.179
When your company does go bankrupt

208
00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:16.779
I'll buy it

209
00:09:16.779 --> 00:09:18.279
At a fire sale price

210
00:09:18.279 --> 00:09:20.279
Your employees won't even be affected

211
00:09:20.279 --> 00:09:21.320
Brilliant

212
00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:23.000
A master of the stock is lowest

213
00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:25.779
Now

214
00:09:25.779 --> 00:09:27.700
This is my event

215
00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:29.929
Please leave

216
00:09:29.929 --> 00:09:30.740
Right

217
00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:31.620
I did this for us

218
00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:34.100
Everything I did I did for us Brian

219
00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:37.450
Chloe

220
00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:39.080
You need help

221
00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:41.340
It's feelings you have for me

222
00:09:42.299 --> 00:09:42.940
It's not love

223
00:09:44.629 --> 00:09:45.429
It's obsession

224
00:09:46.519 --> 00:09:46.919
Enough

225
00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:49.799
If you don't want to ruin everything completely

226
00:09:49.799 --> 00:09:51.299
You'll come with me

227
00:09:51.299 --> 00:09:51.940
Right now

228
00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:54.759
Right now

229
00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:15.980
Did they finally expose Laura's lies?

230
00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:17.110
Shepherd Group

231
00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:18.870
They're the new partner that's partnering up

232
00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:20.789
with Lewis Group for Maplewood

233
00:10:20.789 --> 00:10:22.899
handling all future construction projects

234
00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:24.250
That can't be

235
00:10:24.809 --> 00:10:27.029
What about us? That was our project

236
00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:31.429
Harrison Group is practically out

237
00:10:31.429 --> 00:10:32.309
We have no chance

238
00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:34.389
We can't give up that easily

239
00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:35.909
Remember

240
00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:38.389
Ian Lewis himself appointed me as General Manager

241
00:10:39.029 --> 00:10:41.909
In a few days he promised that he would let us meet with the new heir

242
00:10:43.259 --> 00:10:44.860
If we can just meet with the new heir

243
00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:46.700
We can bypass the shepherds

244
00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:48.149
Meet with the Lewis Group

245
00:10:49.129 --> 00:10:50.889
We just have to play their little game and

246
00:10:50.889 --> 00:10:52.090
See who comes out on top

247
00:10:57.610 --> 00:10:58.570
President's

248
00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:02.570
Brian Shepherd

249
00:11:03.769 --> 00:11:06.279
Mr. Shepherd

250
00:11:06.279 --> 00:11:07.399
It's finally a pleasure to meet you

251
00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:11.159
We've looked into your company's financial review

252
00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:12.899
Very impressive

253
00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:13.860
Thank you

254
00:11:14.659 --> 00:11:15.220
Thank you but

255
00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:17.700
A large part of that success

256
00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:18.820
Is next to Ms. Lewis

257
00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:22.950
She practically saved me from the disaster

258
00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:24.149
Three times over now

259
00:11:24.149 --> 00:11:25.830
Brian you can just call me more

260
00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:29.350
Ms. Lewis' recommendations

261
00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:31.740
Very telling, Mr. Shepherd

262
00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:34.299
Perhaps today he clarifies everything

263
00:11:34.299 --> 00:11:35.500
Mr. Shepherd

264
00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:36.620
Mr. Shepherd

265
00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:41.129
He's a woman like Laura

266
00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:43.450
He's not easy to find

267
00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:46.009
Thank you for your kind words, Mr. Vice President

268
00:11:46.009 --> 00:11:59.879
I'm Ian Lewis

269
00:11:59.879 --> 00:12:02.679
CEO and rightful heir of the Lewis Group

270
00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:06.789
See you're Laura's uncle

271
00:12:06.789 --> 00:12:07.830
In the flesh

272
00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:10.789
So Laura really is your niece

273
00:12:11.429 --> 00:12:13.190
Yes, little Laura

274
00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:15.909
She just threw away her birthright

275
00:12:15.909 --> 00:12:18.070
About two, three years ago

276
00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:21.029
Ran off and married and nobody from Maplewood

277
00:12:21.029 --> 00:12:22.870
I think he was a Harrison

278
00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:26.070
Now Laura's got the VPs and Mr. Yates on her side

279
00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:28.070
Did you hear she's throwing a banquet in a few days

280
00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:29.909
To announce her official takeover?

281
00:12:29.909 --> 00:12:31.980
And we can't let that happen

282
00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:32.860
Can we my dear?

283
00:12:33.659 --> 00:12:36.860
If you're Ian Lewis wouldn't you have the family ring?

284
00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:37.500
Well my dear

285
00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:39.340
That's where you come in

286
00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:40.059
Ms. Duke

287
00:12:40.059 --> 00:12:41.980
We need you to relinquish my ring

288
00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:45.990
What if I, what if I fail?

289
00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:48.149
My family is already ruined

290
00:12:48.149 --> 00:12:50.870
Yes you are in a spot of bother I must say

291
00:12:51.669 --> 00:12:55.029
But if successful I guarantee that you

292
00:12:55.029 --> 00:12:59.190
and the Duke family will get back everything you've lost

293
00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:01.830
Laura's got the VPs and Brian on her side

294
00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:03.669
How can I possibly get the ring?

295
00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:05.429
There is a way you know

296
00:13:05.429 --> 00:13:08.629
that we can make Laura relinquish

297
00:13:08.629 --> 00:13:11.269
and give up that ring willingly

298
00:13:11.269 --> 00:13:14.519
Laura and my dear welcome

299
00:13:16.539 --> 00:13:18.539
It's so good to see you

300
00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:24.179
So good to see you

301
00:13:24.179 --> 00:13:25.220
And you it's been

302
00:13:26.179 --> 00:13:29.379
too long, two, three years perhaps

303
00:13:29.379 --> 00:13:30.419
How have you been?

304
00:13:30.419 --> 00:13:32.019
I've been well Uncle Ian

305
00:13:33.059 --> 00:13:34.019
Thank you for asking

306
00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:38.500
I see you, you've been busy keeping Lewis' group afloat

307
00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:39.700
Yes, you've been busy

308
00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:41.620
Indeed, somebody had to

309
00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:44.740
I mean after you left me with everything to do

310
00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:46.179
Without a safe pair of hands

311
00:13:46.179 --> 00:13:48.259
I hate to think what had happened to the company

312
00:13:49.289 --> 00:13:52.409
Actually Uncle Ian from what I've heard

313
00:13:53.049 --> 00:13:54.649
Give us billions with some

314
00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:57.289
questionable investment decisions

315
00:13:57.850 --> 00:14:00.730
Yes, minor mistakes minor

316
00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:02.409
Don't worry Uncle Ian

317
00:14:02.409 --> 00:14:03.450
I won't hold it against you

318
00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:06.250
Good

319
00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:08.570
Well cheers to you coming back here

320
00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:11.129
And the Lewis group

321
00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:17.340
I'm so sorry Laura, how clumsy of me

322
00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:20.139
No worries Uncle Ian

323
00:14:20.139 --> 00:14:23.129
I'll just go to the restroom

324
00:14:23.129 --> 00:14:24.659
and get cleaned up

325
00:14:24.659 --> 00:14:25.059
Of course

326
00:14:26.059 --> 00:14:27.500
Right away just down to the left

327
00:14:33.779 --> 00:14:34.899
Use it wisely

328
00:14:35.909 --> 00:14:36.470
Oh I will

329
00:14:51.049 --> 00:14:52.730
Hey Laura, how's that?

330
00:14:54.679 --> 00:14:56.759
Your little girlfriend is with me now

331
00:14:56.759 --> 00:15:01.129
Boy, how in the hell did you get Laura's fault?

332
00:15:01.129 --> 00:15:02.730
Let's just say that I have my ways

333
00:15:04.009 --> 00:15:07.500
Listen, boy, don't hurt her

334
00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:10.259
Please, I'll do anything

335
00:15:12.179 --> 00:15:14.740
Come to the abandoned warehouse in the eastern suburbs

336
00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:18.309
Now, don't tell anyone

337
00:15:19.139 --> 00:15:20.100
If you want her alive

338
00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:24.970
Well you certainly do have your ways

339
00:15:28.759 --> 00:15:30.200
Oh thank goodness you've cleared up

340
00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:32.200
I am sorry how clumsy

341
00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:33.399
And don't forget your phone

342
00:15:33.399 --> 00:15:34.600
I retrieved it for you

343
00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:35.720
Thank you

344
00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:36.919
Oh, I love you again

345
00:15:36.919 --> 00:15:37.960
Love you to see you again

346
00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:42.039
Yeah, I guess I'll see you the day after tomorrow at the banquet

347
00:15:42.039 --> 00:15:42.759
At the banquet

348
00:15:43.399 --> 00:15:46.019
I'll see you then

349
00:15:46.019 --> 00:15:46.820
We'll do

350
00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:47.700
Looking forward to it

351
00:15:51.110 --> 00:16:06.980
Where are you?

352
00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:07.620
Gotcha

353
00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:11.289
I'm not expecting that way

354
00:16:11.289 --> 00:16:25.059
You're your little boyfriend got turned

355
00:16:26.789 --> 00:16:28.149
Laura, where are you Laura?

356
00:16:28.149 --> 00:16:34.149
Laura, have you done?

357
00:16:34.149 --> 00:16:35.110
You out of your mind?

358
00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:36.149
Out of my mind

359
00:16:36.149 --> 00:16:40.330
And destroyed my-

360
00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:41.529
That's not true

361
00:16:41.529 --> 00:16:42.730
You're the one messed up

362
00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:54.179
This is insane

363
00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:02.090
Us

364
00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:03.659
You've gone crazy

365
00:17:03.659 --> 00:17:04.619
And you're out of here

366
00:17:04.619 --> 00:17:07.019
Chloe, happy?

367
00:17:07.019 --> 00:17:09.339
It's a very serious offense

368
00:17:09.339 --> 00:17:11.259
They're gonna lock you up for years

369
00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:14.869
About jail time

370
00:17:14.869 --> 00:17:32.900
Like how about his teary pieces serve him

371
00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:34.180
This is about the ring

372
00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:37.690
Are you up to this?

373
00:17:39.269 --> 00:17:42.730
You know Chloe's been trying to kill me

374
00:17:42.730 --> 00:17:44.099
That's foolish

375
00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:46.819
Because who do you think is gonna win?

376
00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:49.480
You

377
00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:50.599
That will not

378
00:17:50.599 --> 00:17:52.890
Or me

379
00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:55.559
Something a little bit more personal

380
00:17:55.559 --> 00:18:04.819
So

381
00:18:04.819 --> 00:18:05.779
Don't move anyone

382
00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:09.460
Don't move

383
00:18:10.309 --> 00:18:12.309
You're about to be arrested for kidnapping

384
00:18:13.259 --> 00:18:13.900
Miss Lewis

385
00:18:14.619 --> 00:18:15.740
Having fun without me

386
00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:17.099
I'm not hurt

387
00:18:25.529 --> 00:18:26.410
Tell me Chloe

388
00:18:28.019 --> 00:18:30.579
Who put you up to this, Chloe?

389
00:18:30.579 --> 00:18:31.539
Why should I tell you?

390
00:18:32.410 --> 00:18:33.529
You're gonna kill me anyway

391
00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:36.230
Chloe, I don't have a problem with you

392
00:18:37.319 --> 00:18:38.839
But if you don't talk

393
00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:42.759
Your beloved Duke Industries

394
00:18:42.759 --> 00:18:43.720
By running to some

395
00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:46.410
Well I'm recording everything Miss Lewis

396
00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:49.269
So the choice is yours Chloe

397
00:18:50.099 --> 00:18:50.500
Talk

398
00:18:51.369 --> 00:18:52.569
Or face the consequences

399
00:18:53.210 --> 00:18:53.609
Fine

400
00:18:54.250 --> 00:18:55.130
Who is Ian Lewis?

401
00:18:56.579 --> 00:18:58.099
He said he'd help Duke Industries

402
00:18:58.099 --> 00:19:02.069
If I kept you away from the banker today

403
00:19:02.069 --> 00:19:04.069
Did you get all of that, Mr. Gates?

404
00:19:04.069 --> 00:19:05.750
I'm recording everything Miss Lewis

405
00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:11.220
Oh, every word Miss Lewis

406
00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:13.460
Are you ready to play a game Brian?

407
00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:25.109
This is crazy here

408
00:19:25.109 --> 00:19:26.549
We're really sure we can do this

409
00:19:26.549 --> 00:19:27.829
All these big companies here

410
00:19:27.829 --> 00:19:28.950
It's crazy

411
00:19:29.029 --> 00:19:30.230
Absolutely

412
00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:32.309
The loot script is under new leadership

413
00:19:32.309 --> 00:19:33.829
We can talk to the heiress herself

414
00:19:34.549 --> 00:19:35.430
Exactly

415
00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:37.269
We just need to make sure we make a good impression

416
00:19:37.269 --> 00:19:38.230
on the new heiress

417
00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:40.309
There's Ian Lewis now

418
00:19:40.869 --> 00:19:42.309
You can introduce us, let's go

419
00:19:42.309 --> 00:19:42.950
Yeah

420
00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:46.380
Hello Ian Lewis

421
00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:47.180
I'm Amber Smith

422
00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:48.539
We spoke on the phone the other day

423
00:19:49.259 --> 00:19:50.299
This has been Harrison

424
00:19:50.299 --> 00:19:51.180
from Harrison Group

425
00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:52.220
How do you do it?

426
00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:52.940
Where the company has-

427
00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:54.299
Yes I know who you are

428
00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:57.980
And Smith you're the one who exposed Laura's little drama

429
00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:00.380
Now look I'm not here for idle chat

430
00:20:05.289 --> 00:20:06.569
Good evening ladies and gentlemen

431
00:20:06.569 --> 00:20:08.250
Could I ask you all to be seated please?

432
00:20:09.289 --> 00:20:10.170
Thank you

433
00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:13.160
The moment you've all been waiting for

434
00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:16.019
Tonight marks a new chapter

435
00:20:16.019 --> 00:20:17.380
in the life of the Lewis Group

436
00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:20.180
A night where the rightful heir takes their place

437
00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:23.140
Would you please join me in welcoming

438
00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:25.460
the heir to the Lewis Group

439
00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:26.500
Miss Laura Lewis

440
00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:29.059
Look everybody attention

441
00:20:29.059 --> 00:20:29.859
Attention please

442
00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:34.019
There's been a recent development

443
00:20:35.019 --> 00:20:36.460
of some tragedy

444
00:20:37.589 --> 00:20:40.309
I just got noticed in my phone call a couple of minutes ago

445
00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:43.269
But Laura has been in a car accident

446
00:20:44.099 --> 00:20:46.900
And tragically she hasn't made it

447
00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:48.259
She has not survived

448
00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:53.539
What? Laura Lewis is- is this dead?

449
00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:56.619
It doesn't matter now she's gone

450
00:20:56.619 --> 00:20:57.740
Miss Laura Lewis

451
00:20:57.740 --> 00:20:58.380
Is this new?

452
00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:00.539
A tragic turn of events Mr Yates

453
00:21:01.099 --> 00:21:03.579
But rest assured the Lewis Group will continue

454
00:21:04.059 --> 00:21:05.740
under my competent leadership

455
00:21:07.559 --> 00:21:08.039
Hold on

456
00:21:08.839 --> 00:21:09.799
Who said that I'm dead

457
00:21:12.309 --> 00:21:12.789
Laura

458
00:21:17.369 --> 00:21:18.410
I don't understand

459
00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:19.690
What's happening?

460
00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:22.009
Laura

461
00:21:22.009 --> 00:21:23.000
But

462
00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:23.559
Where are you?

463
00:21:23.559 --> 00:21:26.279
My apologies for the delay everyone

464
00:21:27.079 --> 00:21:28.119
There seems to be some

465
00:21:29.079 --> 00:21:30.039
Misunderstand

466
00:21:30.039 --> 00:21:32.039
Laura what are you doing here?

467
00:21:32.039 --> 00:21:34.519
You gotta stop this if you upset the Lewis family anymore

468
00:21:34.519 --> 00:21:35.480
We're all doomed

469
00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:36.279
I'll save this once

470
00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:38.039
Back off that lot

471
00:21:43.339 --> 00:21:45.019
Thank you for coming everyone

472
00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:46.619
As I'm sure you know

473
00:21:47.819 --> 00:21:49.019
Tonight

474
00:21:49.019 --> 00:21:51.900
I officially reclaim my title

475
00:21:52.819 --> 00:21:54.819
As the CEO of Lewis Group

476
00:21:57.299 --> 00:21:57.779
Perhaps

477
00:21:58.819 --> 00:22:00.420
You could make some room for me

478
00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:01.380
Cleane

479
00:22:02.099 --> 00:22:03.059
Impossible

480
00:22:03.059 --> 00:22:04.180
How are you still alive?

481
00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:06.900
Well clearly I am alive and well

482
00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:09.220
So why don't we get this started?

483
00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:09.539
No

484
00:22:10.099 --> 00:22:11.940
You're not the rightful heir

485
00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:14.819
You gave that away when you married Ben Harris

486
00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:19.220
Cleane is that seriously your ark best that you have

487
00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:21.299
That I got married too quickly

488
00:22:22.019 --> 00:22:23.460
Well you went off to Maplewood

489
00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:25.539
Three years ago and married a stranger

490
00:22:25.619 --> 00:22:29.299
And left me to work tirelessly keeping the company together

491
00:22:30.759 --> 00:22:31.880
Retire

492
00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:33.640
Enjoy your retirement

493
00:22:34.279 --> 00:22:36.920
Lewis Group will be perfectly fine without you

494
00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:37.720
No

495
00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:39.319
That can only be one heir

496
00:22:40.039 --> 00:22:40.759
And that's me

497
00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:43.640
And the rightful heir has possession

498
00:22:44.279 --> 00:22:44.920
Of this

499
00:22:46.150 --> 00:22:48.950
You think a ring makes an heir

500
00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:51.509
You're even more foolish than I could have ever imagined

501
00:22:53.289 --> 00:22:54.089
Give that back to me

502
00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:55.529
This

503
00:22:55.529 --> 00:22:56.329
Yes

504
00:22:56.410 --> 00:22:58.890
You think some shiny gold thing

505
00:22:59.450 --> 00:23:00.569
Makes you the heir?

506
00:23:00.569 --> 00:23:01.930
Give it back

507
00:23:01.930 --> 00:23:03.529
True leadership

508
00:23:04.539 --> 00:23:07.819
Is about earning the respect of those around you

509
00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:10.299
Not some stupid ring

510
00:23:10.299 --> 00:23:12.420
Oh I ring

511
00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:13.660
Oh my god where is it?

512
00:23:16.789 --> 00:23:17.750
I ring all the way

513
00:23:18.519 --> 00:23:19.400
Now

514
00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:21.160
Everyone if I could have your attention

515
00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:22.359
I'll tell you

516
00:23:23.059 --> 00:23:25.779
Let me show you how a true heir

517
00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:27.460
earns a ring like that

518
00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:43.849
I'm quite the spectacle Mr. Lewis

519
00:23:45.289 --> 00:23:46.329
Security

520
00:23:46.329 --> 00:23:47.130
Escort him out

521
00:23:48.119 --> 00:23:49.240
And Ian

522
00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:50.440
Don't fall over

523
00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:51.640
It's all lies

524
00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:52.359
It's all lies

525
00:23:52.359 --> 00:23:53.000
Fakery

526
00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.359
It's true of his years

527
00:23:54.359 --> 00:23:55.480
Getting out of here

528
00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:56.119
Now

529
00:23:56.119 --> 00:24:02.309
I owe all of you an apology

530
00:24:02.309 --> 00:24:04.390
For everything that's happened tonight

531
00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:06.390
Turns out reclaiming my breath right

532
00:24:07.269 --> 00:24:10.599
Didn't go as smoothly as I had hoped

533
00:24:10.599 --> 00:24:13.480
Luckily these past few days I've had

534
00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:15.940
Mr. Shepherd

535
00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:16.660
By my side

536
00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:18.539
And he has been

537
00:24:19.509 --> 00:24:20.789
A great support

538
00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:22.539
Lewis Group

539
00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:25.500
Has a lot of exciting plans

540
00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:26.299
For Maplewood

541
00:24:28.099 --> 00:24:29.460
I'm proud to announce that

542
00:24:30.299 --> 00:24:31.579
We have secured

543
00:24:31.579 --> 00:24:33.420
A reliable partner

544
00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:36.490
Shepherd Group

545
00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:38.599
Laura hold on

546
00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:41.160
This was never my idea

547
00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:42.680
This was all Cathy and Embers fall

548
00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:44.359
I don't want a divorce

549
00:24:44.359 --> 00:24:44.839
What?

550
00:24:44.839 --> 00:24:46.200
And what are you saying?

551
00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:47.720
He came to me first

552
00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:49.079
Classic Ben

553
00:24:49.079 --> 00:24:50.200
Something goes wrong

554
00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:51.640
And you start pointing the fingers

555
00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:53.640
At all the women in your life

556
00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:55.880
Just don't shut Harrison Group out

557
00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:57.240
Just give me another chance

558
00:24:58.170 --> 00:24:59.130
How could I shut you out?

559
00:24:59.930 --> 00:25:00.970
I'm just a cleaner

560
00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:01.450
Remember?

561
00:25:02.089 --> 00:25:03.930
I'm just a useless housewife

562
00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:07.910
I don't have that power

563
00:25:07.910 --> 00:25:08.710
What are you talking about?

564
00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:09.430
No, come on

565
00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:10.390
No, please, no

566
00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:14.220
Um, Mr. Shepherd

567
00:25:14.779 --> 00:25:15.579
Yes, Mr. Lewis

568
00:25:16.859 --> 00:25:17.900
I was wondering if

569
00:25:20.069 --> 00:25:21.430
Maybe you wanted to grab dinner

570
00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:22.900
Sometime

571
00:25:25.029 --> 00:25:25.430
On me

572
00:25:26.869 --> 00:25:27.509
