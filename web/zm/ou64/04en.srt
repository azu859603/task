00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:06,750
Excuse me, excuse me, where is the Nexus Enterprise Brinklet happening?

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:07,750
Down the hall?

3
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:09,750
In the state bar.

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:27,660
Oh my god, Luke Moss is going to be so rich taking Nexus public, he's genius.

5
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,660
If only he were single.

6
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:37,109
Oh my god, speaking of, isn't that his wife?

7
00:00:37,109 --> 00:00:38,109
Sure is.

8
00:00:38,109 --> 00:00:40,829
She's looking straight up disgusting.

9
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:42,030
Is he?

10
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:45,170
How could you do that in public?

11
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,049
I'm his wife.

12
00:00:47,049 --> 00:00:51,210
Hi, can I help you?

13
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,570
No thanks, I'm looking for my husband.

14
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:59,000
Your husband here, you do realize this is a high class event, right?

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,969
Luke Moss is my husband.

16
00:01:01,969 --> 00:01:04,980
Luke, Luke.

17
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:09,459
Oh, right, and I'm the President of the United States.

18
00:01:09,459 --> 00:01:10,819
Beat it.

19
00:01:10,819 --> 00:01:12,659
No, get out of my way.

20
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:14,019
Hey, hey, get out of here.
