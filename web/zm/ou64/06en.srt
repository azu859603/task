1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,840
Hey, don't touch my man.

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:05,280
Woo, I am begging you.

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:10,160
Don't you please don't do this.

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,830
Okay, I'll give you a chance.

5
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:14,449
What?

6
00:00:14,449 --> 00:00:17,410
I'll give you one chance to get your blimpy ass out of here in the next minute

7
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:20,989
before I call security.

8
00:00:20,989 --> 00:00:23,280
It's official, Matty.

9
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:32,340
Our marriage is over.

10
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,299
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

11
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:44,770
Before you go, there's a quarter of a mill on it.

12
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:47,969
Why don't you take that and disappear from my life for good, will you?

13
00:00:48,289 --> 00:00:51,890
So this is what our three-year marriage means to you?

14
00:00:51,890 --> 00:01:01,119
Axe, fine.

15
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:02,479
It's another quarter of a mill.

16
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:06,480
Just remember to sign the divorce papers right away and never set foot in our house.

17
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,959
I mean, my house ever again.

18
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:13,219
Nope, and nope.

19
00:01:13,219 --> 00:01:14,980
Blimby Butterball, is it worth a nickel?

20
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:17,810
What did you call me?

21
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:19,329
Yeah, that's what we call you.

22
00:01:19,969 --> 00:01:20,769
You didn't know that?

23
00:01:21,569 --> 00:01:22,530
Oh, one more thing.

24
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:23,569
The ring.

25
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:25,010
Hand it over.

26
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:27,150
What?
