00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.559
I love you. I always have. And when we were kids, you were my best friend. You don't even know how much I look up to you.

2
00:00:07.559 --> 00:00:16.059
That's not true. How could you? I'm a loser. No one would ever want me.

3
00:00:24.379 --> 00:00:25.879
Do I disgust you?

4
00:00:25.879 --> 00:00:31.050
No, no, no, no. I just need to... No, you're good.

5
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.049
Look, I just called my assistant. He's gonna come here any second. We're gonna take you home, okay?

6
00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:44.359
Home. I don't have home anymore. My husband just dumped me.

7
00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:51.649
Oh God, help me! Help me! Come on! Get out of here.

8
00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:55.649
Well, we're too, Mr. Raphael. Get over here and help me!

9
00:00:57.649 --> 00:00:59.649
You'll cut a situation again.

10
00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:01.649
Let's get out of here.

11
00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.649
Let's get out of here.

12
00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:29.980
Let's do the couch. Alright, three, two, one.

13
00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.760
Get a blanket and some pillows.

14
00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:48.930
Now, please, it's good to see you, man.
