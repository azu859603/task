1
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:10,650
Matty?

2
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:17,600
Meg.

3
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,679
What happened?

4
00:00:20,679 --> 00:00:26,129
I just got back from my house and...

5
00:00:26,129 --> 00:00:27,929
And?

6
00:00:27,929 --> 00:00:41,929
What are you doing with all my stuff?

7
00:00:41,929 --> 00:00:42,929
Get off me lady.

8
00:00:42,929 --> 00:00:47,520
I'm just doing my job.

9
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,579
What are you doing here?

10
00:00:49,579 --> 00:00:50,579
You.

11
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:52,679
That's what I should be saying to you.

12
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:55,679
Get out of my house this instant!

13
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:56,679
Your house?

14
00:00:56,679 --> 00:00:58,679
Not anymore.

15
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:00,030
What?

16
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:12,599
I thought we made it abundantly clear.

17
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:14,599
I'm divorcing you, Matty.

18
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:20,480
And according to our prenup, this house belongs to me.

19
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,480
You can't do this to me.

20
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,480
This is my home.

21
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:31,040
Yeah, sorry about that, but this is our home.

22
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,859
You recognize this?

23
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:37,989
We're getting married this weekend.

24
00:01:37,989 --> 00:01:44,829
Oh, and don't forget to take all your shit.

25
00:01:44,829 --> 00:01:46,829
Otherwise, we'll find your house.

26
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:57,900
I lost everything.

27
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:01,569
Including the house.

28
00:02:01,569 --> 00:02:03,629
I have nowhere to go.

29
00:02:03,629 --> 00:02:06,299
Well, fuck him.

30
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:08,300
And her too.

31
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:12,530
You can stay here as long as you want.

32
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:14,710
Really?

33
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,710
Thank you Felix.

34
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:22,139
Do you have anything to eat?

35
00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:27,629
Help yourself.

36
00:02:27,629 --> 00:02:29,629
Wow, you can put those down.

37
00:02:29,629 --> 00:02:32,629
Do you want a plate or bread?

38
00:02:32,629 --> 00:02:43,039
I've got some cups if you want one.

39
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:44,039
Man, come on.

40
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,039
Slow down.

41
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,580
Welcome.

42
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:49,449
Always said I hate too much.

43
00:02:49,449 --> 00:03:04,919
I don't know about it.

44
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:05,919
Hey, what are you talking about?

45
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:08,919
Look, there's nothing wrong with being fed.

46
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:12,919
With a big girl body.

47
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:18,460
Look, there's nothing wrong with a big girl body.

48
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,460
Everything's wrong.

49
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:46,669
It's a book based on an ancient Chinese diet therapy.

50
00:03:46,669 --> 00:03:47,669
Four?

51
00:03:47,669 --> 00:03:52,389
Losing weight.

52
00:03:52,389 --> 00:03:55,419
It belonged to my mother.

53
00:03:55,419 --> 00:04:02,699
So yeah, she used to be a bit, um, a bit, you know.

54
00:04:02,699 --> 00:04:05,659
You can't say it Felix.

55
00:04:05,659 --> 00:04:08,060
Fat.

56
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:10,060
A Chinese friend of hers from work.

57
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:19,779
Knew that she was struggling with her weight and gave her this little booklet.

58
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:26,259
So she gave it a try.

59
00:04:26,259 --> 00:04:28,259
And what happened?

60
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:29,350
Here.

61
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:49,170
I'll show you.

62
00:04:49,170 --> 00:05:18,110
Hey, hey, hey, where are you going?

63
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,180
Oh my god.

64
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:39,379
My stomach.

65
00:05:39,379 --> 00:05:40,379
You lost any weight?

66
00:05:40,379 --> 00:05:42,660
A little.

67
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:50,920
What about now?

68
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,920
Have you lost my weight?

69
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,920
Some?

70
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:56,860
No.

71
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:57,860
Oh my god.

72
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,149
What's wrong?

73
00:05:59,149 --> 00:06:06,660
See, I already look unbrokenizing.

74
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:07,660
Yes.

75
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:47,180
Look like a completely different person.

76
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:55,779
Even my voice has changed.

77
00:06:55,779 --> 00:07:01,699
You know what that means?

78
00:07:01,699 --> 00:07:04,699
I can finally get my revenge on Luke.

79
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:09,750
How exactly are you going to do all of that?

80
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:12,259
I can fall in love with me.

81
00:07:12,259 --> 00:07:17,579
And once he's badly in love, he kicks Olivia to the curb.

82
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:18,579
And then I dump him.

83
00:07:18,579 --> 00:07:20,579
That's the Matty I know.

84
00:07:20,579 --> 00:07:24,949
I just, I don't know how.

85
00:07:24,949 --> 00:07:25,949
You know what?

86
00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:28,240
I might be able to help you with that.

87
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:33,240
Now you need a new identity in order to do all of this, right?

88
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,529
Right.

89
00:07:34,529 --> 00:07:41,139
So what if you were my sister?

90
00:07:41,139 --> 00:07:42,139
I'm here for you Matty.

91
00:07:42,139 --> 00:08:02,829
He licks Raphael.

92
00:08:02,829 --> 00:08:05,500
Huge fan of yours, man.

93
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,500
What a pleasure.

94
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,790
Well, if it isn't the new billionaire on the block.

95
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:15,339
Or have you already lost all your money on half-baked purchases?

96
00:08:15,339 --> 00:08:16,339
Ouch.

97
00:08:16,339 --> 00:08:17,339
I hope not.

98
00:08:17,339 --> 00:08:20,339
Just about a house in the Maldives and a yacht to go with it.

99
00:08:20,339 --> 00:08:21,339
Exactly to my point.

100
00:08:21,339 --> 00:08:22,850
Anyways, bud.

101
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:24,850
Enjoy it.

102
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:26,740
Well, it lasts.

103
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,160
What do you mean?

104
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:51,789
Who is that woman?

105
00:08:51,789 --> 00:08:54,809
God.

106
00:08:54,809 --> 00:08:57,480
Who is that woman?

107
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:06,960
I'll give you one chance to get your blimpy ass out of here in the next minute before I call security.

108
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,960
It's official, Matty.

109
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,960
Our marriage is over.

110
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,120
We need a gendier ex-husband.

111
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,120
Felix.

112
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:18,120
I'm afraid you haven't introduced me yet to your charming girlfriend.

113
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,120
Ah, girlfriend.

114
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,120
No, no.

115
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,120
I'm his sister.

116
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,919
Raphael?

117
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:24,019
Pleasure.

118
00:09:24,019 --> 00:09:27,019
Pleasure is all mine, Madeline.

119
00:09:27,019 --> 00:09:32,279
There's something familiar to you.

120
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:34,279
Have we ever met before?

121
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:37,409
I'm afraid not.

122
00:09:37,409 --> 00:09:40,409
Madeline's been out of the country for some time now.

123
00:09:40,409 --> 00:09:41,409
Doing her studies abroad.

124
00:09:41,409 --> 00:09:44,409
Oh, well, it's great to have you back.

125
00:09:44,409 --> 00:09:45,409
So tell me.

126
00:09:45,409 --> 00:09:46,409
What are your plans?

127
00:09:46,409 --> 00:09:48,409
Well, I'm looking for a job.

128
00:09:48,409 --> 00:09:49,860
A job?

129
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,860
Your brother hears the owner of Lumina Tech.

130
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,860
There's no better place to get a job than there.

131
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:59,980
Well, I admire everything my brother has accomplished, but I would like to carve my own path.

132
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,179
Impressive.

133
00:10:01,179 --> 00:10:04,179
Actually, I've done some research on your company.

134
00:10:04,179 --> 00:10:05,179
Nexus Enterprises?

135
00:10:05,179 --> 00:10:10,269
And I have to say, I would love to work for you.

136
00:10:10,269 --> 00:10:11,269
Really?

137
00:10:11,269 --> 00:10:13,269
Well, we'd love to have you.

138
00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:15,269
Here, I'll make some calls, see where we can place you.

139
00:10:15,269 --> 00:10:19,269
No, I would love to work for you.

140
00:10:19,269 --> 00:10:22,620
Maybe as your assistant.

141
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:23,659
Assistant?

142
00:10:23,659 --> 00:10:25,659
Do you have what?

143
00:10:25,659 --> 00:10:26,659
Yes.

144
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:27,820
I mean, no.

145
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:28,820
Yes.

146
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:29,820
Yes.

147
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:30,850
Yes?

148
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:31,850
Yes, yes.

149
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:35,850
But he recently quit.

150
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:39,850
Today, actually, said he needed to spend some time with the family.

151
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:41,850
So, no.

152
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:44,850
No, I don't have an assistant.

153
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:45,850
Great.

154
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:49,419
Oh, that means I could work for you.

155
00:10:49,419 --> 00:10:50,840
Yes.

156
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,840
I mean, yeah, they could.

157
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,799
Yeah.

158
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:55,799
Let's do it.

159
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:56,929
Great.

160
00:10:56,929 --> 00:10:58,929
Let's celebrate.

161
00:10:58,929 --> 00:10:59,929
Later?

162
00:10:59,929 --> 00:11:03,360
Thank you.

163
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:08,940
What the hell?

164
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,379
I'm so sorry.

165
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:12,379
Quit.

166
00:11:12,379 --> 00:11:13,379
No, it's my fault.

167
00:11:13,379 --> 00:11:14,379
I'm sorry.

168
00:11:14,379 --> 00:11:15,379
It's fine.

169
00:11:15,379 --> 00:11:17,500
Excuse me.

170
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,500
I'm going to go clean up in the bathroom.

171
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:27,710
I think he's taking the paint.

172
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:28,809
Time to reel in.

173
00:11:28,809 --> 00:11:35,019
Hold my drink.

174
00:11:35,019 --> 00:11:47,990
Waiter.

175
00:11:47,990 --> 00:12:03,200
A little something for you.

176
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,740
You do.

177
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:10,750
It was supposed to be for my brother.

178
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:13,909
I had it in the car and it felt so bad.

179
00:12:13,909 --> 00:12:15,909
I figured you could use it.

180
00:12:15,909 --> 00:12:16,980
You sure?

181
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:19,809
Of course.

182
00:12:19,809 --> 00:12:23,379
Here, why don't you take that dirty shirt off?

183
00:12:23,379 --> 00:12:45,860
Actually, why don't I take it off for you?

184
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:46,860
My wife is going to love me.

185
00:12:46,860 --> 00:13:01,100
Help me that shirt.

186
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,100
I'll have a dry clean for you.

187
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:07,340
See you Monday, 9 a.m.?

188
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,340
Monday.

189
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:12,740
I'm your new assistant.

190
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:13,740
Right.

191
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:16,500
What?

192
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:25,220
Look.

193
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,220
Yes, boss?

194
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:52,620
You're fired.

195
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:53,620
We're here.

196
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:54,620
Relax.

197
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,779
I told you I'd be late at the gala.

198
00:13:56,779 --> 00:13:59,779
I have been sneezing and coughing here.

199
00:13:59,779 --> 00:14:01,779
And you didn't even think of at least calling me?

200
00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:03,779
I am your wife now.

201
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:05,779
Hey, hey, I told you I would be late.

202
00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:09,610
What are you wearing?

203
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:10,610
Close?

204
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:11,610
No, Luke.

205
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:12,610
You're shirt.

206
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:14,610
You did not leave the house wearing that shirt.

207
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:18,039
Shirt, Luke.

208
00:14:18,039 --> 00:14:19,039
Look, look.

209
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:20,039
I was...

210
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:21,039
I was...

211
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:22,039
Some stupid waiters filled wine on me.

212
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:23,039
Alright?

213
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:25,039
And then it got dirty and so I had to change it.

214
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:34,490
What?

215
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:40,769
What's wrong?

216
00:14:40,769 --> 00:14:43,620
Crazy?

217
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:47,629
It works.

218
00:14:47,629 --> 00:14:48,629
Look, it's not what it looks like.

219
00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:51,070
Okay?

220
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:53,070
You were sleeping on my couch tonight.

221
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:54,070
Leave me at no.

222
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:55,070
Just stop it.

223
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:57,169
Okay, it was the waiters filled.

224
00:14:57,169 --> 00:14:59,610
Just listen to me.

225
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:25,250
Leave.

226
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:28,720
There's something new to you.

227
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,070
What's up?

228
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:33,000
I'm having this aura.

229
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,299
A aura?

230
00:15:37,299 --> 00:15:44,019
I see what you're doing.

231
00:15:44,019 --> 00:15:46,019
You can't pull that off on me.

232
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:52,759
I'm no sucker like Luke.

233
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:56,429
You know the greatest way to get your revenge

234
00:15:56,429 --> 00:15:58,429
is by just living your best life, right?

235
00:15:58,429 --> 00:16:05,559
Don't you think that by trying to pull this whole thing off

236
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:08,879
you might not get what you really want?

237
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:12,190
I feel like I know exactly what I want.

238
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:13,190
I have no idea what Luke did to me.

239
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:15,279
He dumped me.

240
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:16,279
He tried to ruin me.

241
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:18,409
Because I was fat.

242
00:16:18,409 --> 00:16:20,269
I feel that.

243
00:16:20,269 --> 00:16:21,269
I know what you went through.

244
00:16:21,269 --> 00:16:22,269
No.

245
00:16:22,269 --> 00:16:24,039
No, you don't.

246
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:25,039
I do.

247
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:27,620
Remember how my mom used to be fat?

248
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:28,649
Hey you!

249
00:16:28,649 --> 00:16:33,059
I didn't know there was going to be an earthquake today.

250
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:34,059
Whoa!

251
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:35,059
Whoa!

252
00:16:35,059 --> 00:16:38,779
Yeah, keep walking.

253
00:16:38,779 --> 00:16:43,059
I can't tell you the countless times people bullied my mother

254
00:16:43,059 --> 00:16:44,059
because of her way.

255
00:16:44,059 --> 00:16:48,759
And is that why you want to help me so bad?

256
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:50,049
Yeah.

257
00:16:50,049 --> 00:16:54,000
And why I want you to live your best life.

258
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,059
Forget him.

259
00:16:57,059 --> 00:16:58,059
And your past.

260
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:01,919
You need to move on.

261
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:03,590
Thank you.

262
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:07,680
And I am sorry that happened to your mother.

263
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:10,000
But you didn't live my life.

264
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
And my skin.

265
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,089
Luke is going to suffer.

266
00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:15,119
And his mistress.

267
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,119
And his mother.

268
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,119
And his company.

269
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:21,869
I've lost my appetite.

270
00:17:21,869 --> 00:17:39,299
Well, if it isn't Miss First Day on the job herself.

271
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:41,299
Come on in, Madeline.

272
00:17:41,299 --> 00:17:47,890
This week's agenda, I've arranged all your meetings

273
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:50,890
and she's all a day to do weekly miracles.

274
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:53,460
You are something, aren't you?

275
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:59,059
Well, anything for my boss.

276
00:17:59,059 --> 00:18:04,730
Come on in, Anthony.

277
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:08,230
Good morning, Luke.

278
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:10,230
I just wanted to pop by in.

279
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:11,230
Give you this.

280
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:13,230
It's a gift from my wife for taking the company public.

281
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:15,230
And for your new marriage.

282
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:16,230
Congratulations.

283
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:18,230
Thank you, Anthony.

284
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:22,230
I'd like to introduce you to my new assistant, Madeline Raphael.

285
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:25,230
Madeline, Anthony is our vice president.

286
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:29,019
It's nice to meet you, Anthony.

287
00:18:29,019 --> 00:18:30,019
Hello, Madeline.

288
00:18:30,019 --> 00:18:34,660
What do you feel right if I had a piece of that?

289
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:43,500
Well, yes, of course.

290
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:51,829
Okay.

291
00:18:51,829 --> 00:18:52,829
We'll catch you guys later.

292
00:18:52,829 --> 00:18:53,829
Okay.

293
00:18:53,829 --> 00:18:54,829
Thanks again.

294
00:18:54,829 --> 00:19:15,900
It's all yours, boss.

295
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,569
Enjoy.

296
00:19:18,569 --> 00:19:35,920
What happened?

297
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,579
Broke down.

298
00:19:38,579 --> 00:19:39,579
I'm just going to go grab an Uber.

299
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:41,579
No, I mean to your leg.

300
00:19:41,579 --> 00:19:45,640
It's actually my ankle.

301
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,900
I have really weak ankles.

302
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:48,900
Well, get in.

303
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:49,900
I'll take you home.

304
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:53,779
Are you sure?

305
00:19:53,779 --> 00:19:54,779
No.

306
00:19:54,779 --> 00:19:56,900
I don't want to be an inconvenience.

307
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,900
I won't take no for an answer.

308
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:07,740
No.

309
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:10,259
You're actually like historically bad at this.

310
00:20:10,259 --> 00:20:11,259
Hey.

311
00:20:11,259 --> 00:20:12,930
Hey.

312
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:13,930
Okay.

313
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:14,930
I am undefeated.

314
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:18,859
Your brother's got quite a palace for himself, huh?

315
00:20:18,859 --> 00:20:19,859
Yeah.

316
00:20:19,859 --> 00:20:24,859
Well, I'm just staying here temporarily until I can get settled.

317
00:20:24,859 --> 00:20:26,980
Oh, I got something for you.

318
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:33,170
Thanks.

319
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:38,589
I have yours inside.

320
00:20:38,589 --> 00:20:41,880
If you want to come in and wait while I get it for you.

321
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,880
All right.

322
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,359
Sounds good to me.

323
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:45,420
Careful.

324
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,420
Thanks.

325
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:52,079
If you just want to wait right here, I can go up and grab it for you.

326
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:53,079
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

327
00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:55,079
Let's just have a seat and I can check your ankle.

328
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:56,079
Hey.

329
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:57,079
Can you give me some ointment?

330
00:20:57,079 --> 00:21:09,869
I think I twisted my ankle again.

331
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:15,920
You wouldn't be twisting your ankle if you weren't carrying all that baggage around.

332
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,920
What's going on?

333
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,920
Nothing.

334
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,920
Just checking on Madeline's ankle.

335
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:33,970
She's got weak ankles.

336
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:34,970
Isn't that right, Madeline?

337
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:35,970
No.

338
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:36,970
No.

339
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:37,970
Interesting.

340
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:38,970
You're the CEO of Exis Enterprises.

341
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:40,970
You don't have more pressing matters than ankles.

342
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:44,970
Well, I just wanted to make sure she felt cared for on her first day of work.

343
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,970
Oh, the deluxe treatment, huh?

344
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:47,970
It's a first-of-foot massage.

345
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:48,970
What's next?

346
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:49,970
Full-body rub-down?

347
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:50,970
Hey, Lewis.

348
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:55,450
Well, I think I better get going.

349
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:56,450
Don't worry about the shirt, Madeline.

350
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:58,450
You can return it to me at work.

351
00:21:58,450 --> 00:21:59,450
I hope you feel better.

352
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:01,450
Don't worry about the shirt, Madeline.

353
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:05,220
You can return it to me at work.

354
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:08,369
I hope you feel better.

355
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:14,579
Thanks.

356
00:22:14,579 --> 00:22:18,259
Watch the attitude.

357
00:22:18,259 --> 00:22:20,859
I don't want to see him touching you.

358
00:22:20,859 --> 00:22:22,859
I don't want to see him touching you.

359
00:22:22,859 --> 00:22:25,950
What's that?

360
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:26,950
Because.

361
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:28,660
Because why?

362
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:33,980
Come.

363
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:48,329
What's next to me?

364
00:22:48,329 --> 00:22:52,329
Do you have something you'd like to say to me, Felix?

365
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:54,329
He's a two-faced asshole.

366
00:22:54,329 --> 00:22:56,329
And I don't want to see you around him.

367
00:22:56,329 --> 00:22:59,420
I'm getting jealous, sorry.

368
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,509
No.

369
00:23:00,509 --> 00:23:02,509
No, I'm not.

370
00:23:04,019 --> 00:23:06,180
I...

371
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:08,180
I just want...

372
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:15,220
Felix, he has to see me around you to really buy that we're siblings.

373
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:21,259
My plan has to go off without a hitch.

374
00:23:21,259 --> 00:23:22,259
Then what's your plan?

375
00:23:22,259 --> 00:23:25,259
The company has an important bidding meeting next month.

376
00:23:25,259 --> 00:23:32,500
I can stop him if I can get a hold of the tender proposal in advance.

377
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:37,599
You mean the multi-billion dollar city garden project?

378
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:43,529
If he fails, his position as CEO of Nexus is at risk.

379
00:23:43,529 --> 00:23:45,529
Oh, you're a smart cookie.

380
00:23:45,529 --> 00:23:46,529
Ow!

381
00:23:46,529 --> 00:23:48,529
Oh my god, the ankle thing's real?

382
00:23:48,529 --> 00:23:49,529
Yeah.

383
00:23:49,529 --> 00:23:50,529
I'm so sorry.

384
00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:51,529
I'll give some weight in it.

385
00:23:51,529 --> 00:23:54,529
Ah, no.

386
00:23:54,529 --> 00:24:06,150
Feel better.

387
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:16,579
I think it's time for Olivia to meet Madeline.

388
00:24:16,579 --> 00:24:23,500
Hi.

389
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:26,759
I'm just calling for Mr. Moss's office.

390
00:24:26,759 --> 00:24:29,339
Who is this?

391
00:24:29,339 --> 00:24:31,339
You must be Olivia.

392
00:24:31,339 --> 00:24:33,339
Who is this?

393
00:24:33,339 --> 00:24:39,579
Oh, I was just calling to say that Mr. Moss might be coming home late tonight.

394
00:24:39,579 --> 00:24:43,779
Seems like we'll be having a very long night.

395
00:24:43,779 --> 00:24:48,789
This bitch thinks she can steal my man.

396
00:24:48,789 --> 00:24:50,789
I'm going to show her.

397
00:24:50,789 --> 00:25:03,220
Please come in.

398
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:07,259
What do you got?

399
00:25:07,259 --> 00:25:09,869
Oh, nothing.

400
00:25:09,869 --> 00:25:13,869
Just a little nourishment for my hard-working boss.

401
00:25:13,869 --> 00:25:20,700
Is this yellow to go?

402
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:21,859
Yep.

403
00:25:21,859 --> 00:25:23,309
This is my favorite.

404
00:25:23,309 --> 00:25:25,730
Yeah, how'd you know?

405
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:29,750
Well, that's what assistants do.

406
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:34,200
It's our job to know you inside a doubt.

407
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:41,309
Well, I'm not going to be able to eat all this sushi by myself, much less.

408
00:25:41,309 --> 00:25:44,500
Finish an entire bottle of champagne.

409
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:51,089
I think I might need your assistance with this.

410
00:25:51,089 --> 00:26:02,400
Anything for my boss?

411
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:07,289
So, what shall we toast you?

412
00:26:08,829 --> 00:26:11,829
How about the future of your company?

413
00:26:11,829 --> 00:26:17,940
Well, to the future of my company.

414
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:43,460
It's so good.

415
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:47,940
Well, boss, it's getting kind of late.

416
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:51,099
Don't worry about it.

417
00:26:51,099 --> 00:26:53,509
Go home, get some rest.

418
00:26:53,509 --> 00:27:02,450
Great job today.

419
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:03,450
Fun has just begun.

420
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:17,059
Where is she?

421
00:27:17,059 --> 00:27:21,779
You're a bimbo assistant.

422
00:27:21,779 --> 00:27:27,779
Oh, well, she, I mean he, he left a long time ago.

423
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:29,940
Don't you lie to me.

424
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,130
I know it's a she.

425
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:33,130
I just spoke with her.

426
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:34,130
She's here.

427
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:35,130
Where?

428
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:37,420
All right, I'm telling you she left.

429
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:45,740
So you ate all this sushi and champagne all by yourself?

430
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:46,740
Yeah.

431
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:53,500
Yeah?

432
00:27:53,500 --> 00:28:00,259
Yeah, I guess.

433
00:28:00,259 --> 00:28:14,720
You don't want to be with a snap of a finger.

434
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:23,339
You dare threaten me.

435
00:28:23,339 --> 00:28:31,059
That's right.

436
00:28:31,059 --> 00:28:34,059
You're messing with the wrong woman.
