1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:10,589
Has anyone ever told you you have the prettiest eyes?

2
00:00:10,589 --> 00:00:33,380
Good Disney?

3
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:46,890
Luke, are you ready to discuss the city garden project proposal?

4
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:48,890
Yes, of course. Let's do it.

5
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:49,890
I should go.

6
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:53,950
Oh, no. Please stay. I want you to join us.

7
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:59,170
It's imperative that Madeline here knows everything about the deal.

8
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:09,859
I have to say, Anthony, those are some great ideas.

9
00:01:09,859 --> 00:01:11,859
Look, this has been a very productive meeting.

10
00:01:11,859 --> 00:01:14,859
I think we have an excellent shot at securing this proposal.

11
00:01:14,859 --> 00:01:23,349
Oh, and here. This is your copy of the drafted proposal, so you have the exact numbers.

12
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:25,349
Absolutely perfect.

13
00:01:25,349 --> 00:01:28,280
I'll take a look at this later.

14
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,280
Say Madeline. Anthony? You hungry?

15
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,379
How about we all grab some lunch?

16
00:01:33,379 --> 00:01:35,540
My tree?

17
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,540
Sure. Let's do it.

18
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:46,510
Yeah, I'm so sorry.

19
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:47,510
Are you all right?

20
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:54,260
Yeah, you know what? I'll stay here alone and clean this up.

21
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:57,260
Why don't you guys go ahead. Just order me something?
