1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,600
What the hell is wrong with you?

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,599
No, no, no, no, baby, no.

3
00:00:04,599 --> 00:00:06,099
It was her fault.

4
00:00:06,099 --> 00:00:08,099
I was trying to throw the coffee at her.

5
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:09,099
Madeline?

6
00:00:09,099 --> 00:00:10,599
She's my assistant.

7
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:13,099
Look, how dare you disrespect her and me.

8
00:00:13,099 --> 00:00:15,599
I want you out of my office now.

9
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,129
You're kicking me out of your office.

10
00:00:18,129 --> 00:00:23,199
Luke, remember, you don't want to mess with me.

11
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:24,699
What do you think I am, huh?

12
00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:26,699
I'm a fucking billionaire CEO.

13
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:28,699
You are nothing without me.

14
00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:30,199
Now get up.

15
00:00:31,059 --> 00:00:33,060
Oh, dare you speak to me that way?

16
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:35,060
I am your wife!

17
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:38,560
No, no, no, no, this is my chance.

18
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,560
What do I do?

19
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,219
You crazy bitch!

20
00:00:43,219 --> 00:00:45,219
Get up!

21
00:00:45,219 --> 00:00:49,579
I will not forgive you for this.

22
00:00:49,579 --> 00:00:54,020
Olivia, don't forget your bag.

23
00:00:54,020 --> 00:01:11,519
You're Madeline.

24
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:13,519
I'm so sorry for her behavior.

25
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:17,159
No, no, this is all my fault.

26
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:19,159
None of this would have happened if it wasn't for me.

27
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:20,159
I'm so sorry for her behavior.
