00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.399
This is all my fault, none of this would have happened if it wasn't for me.

2
00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:05.000
I don't say that.

3
00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:07.190
But it's true.

4
00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:10.279
No, I should just quit.

5
00:00:10.279 --> 00:00:13.859
Absolutely not. I refuse.

6
00:00:13.859 --> 00:00:15.210
But...

7
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.210
But she wants me fired.

8
00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.210
I would rather leave her before firing you.

9
00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:29.179
You like me that much?

10
00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:30.179
Oh yeah.

11
00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:37.530
No way.

12
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.530
How'd you manage to sneak a photo of the proposal, Tender?

13
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:41.530
Skills, my guy.

14
00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.530
Skills.

15
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.590
And once I leak that to the competitors,

16
00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.590
it will have zero chance of winning.

17
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.850
Whoa, but if you thought about what would happen if you got caught with this,

18
00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.850
you're gonna be in some deep shit.

19
00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.850
Negative.

20
00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.899
I'm not the last one to touch the proposal.

21
00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:02.899
Go on.

22
00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:06.790
Let's just say my dear friend, Olivia,

23
00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.790
also had her hands in the cookie jar,

24
00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.790
and she doesn't even know it yet.

25
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.790
Gorgeous and smart.

26
00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.790
Who are you and where did you come from?

27
00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.620
Oh, you really want to know.

28
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:19.620
Sure you do.
