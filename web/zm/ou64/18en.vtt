1
00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:03.459
Sure do.

2
00:00:03.459 --> 00:00:05.459
In time, Felix.

3
00:00:05.459 --> 00:00:08.060
In time.

4
00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:18.710
Luke, we lost the bid.

5
00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.739
Fuck me!

6
00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:28.440
How do we lose by just a mill?

7
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.440
That's impossible. The bid was for ten billion.

8
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.439
Yeah, and that's what's weird.

9
00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:34.439
It doesn't make any sense.

10
00:00:34.439 --> 00:00:36.469
They must have known our bottom line.

11
00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:41.240
Yeah, but the only way they would have known that is if they had access to our proposal tender.

12
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.240
Exactly.

13
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.240
And there were only three people in that meeting.

14
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:52.399
You, me, and...

15
00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:54.399
Absolutely not. Don't even go there, Anthony.

16
00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:56.399
I trust Madeline with my life.
