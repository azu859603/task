Hey, Olivia.

2
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:09,580
Hi, Jacob.

3
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:11,580
I need you to do me a favor.

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,580
Anything for you, Olivia? What's up?

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,539
I need you to take some dirt on someone.

6
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:21,539
Her name is Madeline Raphael.

7
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:23,539
Sister of Felix Raphael.

8
00:00:23,539 --> 00:00:26,460
You got it.

9
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:39,159
We're here live at the scene in front of Nexus Enterprises,

10
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:42,159
where Nexus CEO Luke Moss is facing heavy scrutiny.

11
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:45,159
He's under pressure from scare holders for having dropped the ball

12
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:47,159
on the lucrative city garden projects,

13
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:52,340
which is valued at an estimated $10 billion.

14
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:12,230
Cheers.

15
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:16,230
You know, I think it's called for something a little more than just a toast.

16
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:18,230
What did you have in mind?

17
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:20,680
Do you like surprises?

18
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,680
He does.
