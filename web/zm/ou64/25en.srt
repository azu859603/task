1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:25,620
Hey Olivia, it's Jacob. Got some news for you. Turns out Felix Raphael does not have a sister. He's an only child.

2
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,620
I knew it!

3
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:34,770
Great job, Jacob. Now I want you to find out exactly where this metal line lives.

4
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,570
You got it.

5
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:42,119
Let the fun begin.

6
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:49,270
Here you are, Olivia.

7
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:51,369
You are your mousey little hoe.

8
00:00:51,369 --> 00:00:53,369
Don't talk to me like that.

9
00:00:53,369 --> 00:00:57,460
You fraud. I just found out who you really are.

10
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,460
Oh no, she knows.

11
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,460
Oh, Kat got your tongue.

12
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:06,819
You thought you could fool us with your little story about your billionaire brother?

13
00:01:06,819 --> 00:01:14,000
You're no billionaire. You're a gold digging tramp, and it's just a matter of time until everyone else finds out.

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,920
I'll make sure of it.

15
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,340
Well, good luck with that. You can hardly keep your own man.

16
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:25,780
You can barely keep his hands off me.

17
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:36,390
I'm going to make your life a living hell.

18
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,900
You did this to me once before.

19
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,900
And now it's my turn to do it to you.

20
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:45,109
What the hell is this slut talking about?

21
00:01:45,109 --> 00:01:55,719
Running cutie?

22
00:01:55,719 --> 00:02:05,840
Hey. Hey, red's right there. You can make your own toast.

23
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,840
Someone's upset. Want to discuss?

24
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,219
There's nothing to discuss. All's good.

25
00:02:13,219 --> 00:02:18,870
Are you upset about last night?

26
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:22,379
Why'd you come back so late?

27
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:25,379
I was working on my plan. It requires dedication.

28
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:35,469
Going to the bar with your ex-husband at midnight? That's dedication? What would you do?

29
00:02:35,469 --> 00:02:38,469
Well, he was drunk.

30
00:02:38,469 --> 00:02:42,460
We went back to his hotel room.

31
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,460
You went to his hotel room?

32
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:45,560
You went to his hotel room?

33
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,560
No, it's not.

34
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:52,560
That doesn't matter. Don't tell me I don't want to know. I just want...

35
00:02:52,560 --> 00:03:04,639
What do you want?

36
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:11,099
I just want you to let this go.

37
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:14,099
Your plan?

38
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:21,819
Feel like some. This close. This close to my revenge.

39
00:03:21,819 --> 00:03:25,520
It won't be much longer.

40
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:31,169
You promise?

41
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:33,379
Promise.

42
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:36,090
I don't want to see you get hurt again.

43
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,090
The people you're dealing with are insane.

44
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:51,039
I won't.

45
00:03:51,039 --> 00:04:07,259
This dirty little gold digger is trying to seduce everyone.

46
00:04:07,259 --> 00:04:09,580
I'm going to put an end to you.

47
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:29,339
Madeline. What's going on?

48
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:33,290
I'm resigning.

49
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:36,819
You're what?

50
00:04:36,819 --> 00:04:37,819
I'm leaving, Luke.

51
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:46,250
Someone let you know that I hate some of the best experiences of my life working here.

52
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:49,250
No, she's doing this to you. Olivia's pressuring you to quit.

53
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,600
But she's right.

54
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,709
I should have never sent those pictures out.

55
00:04:56,709 --> 00:04:57,970
That was you?

56
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:00,970
I don't know what I was thinking. I'm so stupid.

57
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:12,930
God, it's just that I have a crush on you.

58
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:16,620
You do?

59
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:20,670
Oh, Madeline. That's totally fine.

60
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:23,670
You have no idea how special last night was for me.

61
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:27,519
Me too.

62
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:31,339
Oh, God.

63
00:05:31,339 --> 00:05:35,579
But that's not all. There's something else.

64
00:05:35,579 --> 00:05:36,939
What?

65
00:05:36,939 --> 00:05:41,209
I'm Madeline. You can tell me.

66
00:05:41,209 --> 00:05:54,379
Maybe Felix's sister, half sister.

67
00:05:54,379 --> 00:05:58,740
Olivia found out and now she's threatening to tell everybody.

68
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,740
Look, I don't mind one bit.

69
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:05,740
Look, and as far as your job's concerned, you're absolutely safe here.

70
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,990
You got it?

71
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:10,430
Why are you so good to me?

72
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:26,779
It's because I'm in love with you, Madeline.

73
00:06:26,779 --> 00:06:31,600
Got you where I want you.

74
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,660
Aren't you going to say something?

75
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:44,290
Well, it's just that I'm so happy and also so sad at the same time.

76
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:47,110
What do you mean?

77
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:55,279
Well, I'm happy because I feel the same way about you too.

78
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:56,279
Anyway.

79
00:06:56,279 --> 00:07:01,339
But I'm sad because we're married and...

80
00:07:01,339 --> 00:07:03,339
That means we'll never be together.

81
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:07,879
Yes, we can. We'll break it off with her. You'll see.

82
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:15,980
Okay.

83
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:27,089
You're so beautiful. You know that? Can I kiss you?

84
00:07:27,089 --> 00:07:36,180
Not until you're divorced and single.

85
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:39,699
I agree. I'll start working on it right now.

86
00:07:39,699 --> 00:07:40,699
You will?

87
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:41,699
Yes.

88
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:47,709
I'm going to go back to my place, grab my things. I'm moving out.

89
00:07:47,709 --> 00:07:48,709
What you mind joining me?

90
00:07:48,709 --> 00:08:01,600
It is a beautiful mansion, isn't it?

91
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:21,089
Although, now that I'm a billionaire, I'm definitely going to upgrade.

92
00:08:21,089 --> 00:08:24,500
My home. So many memories.

93
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,420
Madeline. What's wrong?

94
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,420
It is beautiful.

95
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:33,259
Well, I'm going to get some things from the garage.

96
00:08:33,259 --> 00:08:35,509
You mind picking out some clothes of mine from my room?

97
00:08:35,509 --> 00:08:40,440
Oh, is... is she here?

98
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:44,440
Oh, Olivia? No. No, she's probably at the spa.

99
00:08:44,440 --> 00:09:21,470
Come on.

100
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:26,470
Luke and I just had the most amazing sex on that bed.

101
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:28,470
We came back here for...

102
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:45,460
How's it going? Almost finished?

103
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:51,779
Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

104
00:09:51,779 --> 00:10:03,629
You know, I just love this shirt, don't you?

105
00:10:03,629 --> 00:10:05,950
This feels familiar.

106
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:24,860
Hey, Luke. You got your new shirt. What do you think?

107
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,860
Yeah. Yeah.

108
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:31,419
Oh, hi.

109
00:10:31,419 --> 00:11:17,580
Hey, come on. Let's get out of here.

110
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:21,279
Bitch! I'm going to make your life a living hell!

111
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,629
You did this to me once before.

112
00:11:23,629 --> 00:11:31,809
It's my turn to do it to you.

113
00:11:31,809 --> 00:11:35,120
My bedroom.

114
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,120
Finish up that gold digging bitch once and for all.

115
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:52,690
Did you watch the video?

116
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:54,169
And?

117
00:11:54,169 --> 00:11:55,169
And?

118
00:11:55,169 --> 00:11:58,419
She's been lying to you this whole time.

119
00:11:58,419 --> 00:12:00,809
That's not Felix's sister.

120
00:12:00,809 --> 00:12:03,809
That gold digging whore is trying to seduce him as well.

121
00:12:03,809 --> 00:12:05,809
There are siblings.

122
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:10,940
Hello? Hello?

123
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:19,960
Divorce? What?

124
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:25,330
Yes. I think Luke wants to divorce me.

125
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:30,029
That's impossible. But you two just got married.

126
00:12:30,029 --> 00:12:33,929
It's because of his new assistant, Madeline.

127
00:12:33,929 --> 00:12:38,059
She's manipulated. Luke seduced him.

128
00:12:38,059 --> 00:12:42,210
Don't you worry about this, Olivia.

129
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:55,590
I will make sure this gold digging whore disappears from my son's life.

130
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:58,590
You have no idea what you're talking about. Just stay out of this.

131
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:02,590
Luke, ask your mother. It is my job to look out for you.

132
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:05,620
Now you know that I want what's best for you.

133
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:08,620
And what's best for you is to stay away from her.

134
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,620
You need to fire her.

135
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:14,139
But you don't even know Madeline.

136
00:13:14,139 --> 00:13:17,100
Speak of the angel.

137
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,379
Sorry to interrupt.

138
00:13:19,379 --> 00:13:22,379
Luke, I just wanted to confirm your three o'clock conference call.

139
00:13:22,379 --> 00:13:24,480
Madeline, please come in.

140
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,820
I want to introduce you to someone very special.

141
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:36,240
You are a disgrace.

142
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:42,889
It's very nice to meet you, Bunny.

143
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:50,720
Watch your manners, young girl.

144
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,720
You addressed me as Miss Moss. Got it?

145
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,720
Mom!

146
00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:00,720
Luke, I must say I am quite disappointed in your hiring practices.

147
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:06,720
There are far too many gold diggers out there trying to sleep their way to the top without any qualifications.

148
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,720
Excuse me.

149
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,720
Excuse you.

150
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,720
Mom, mom, mom, mom.

151
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,720
Madeline here belongs to the Raphael family.

152
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:21,559
Raphael family?

153
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:25,710
The billionaire, Felix Raphael?

154
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:27,190
That's her brother.

155
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:29,860
She's an heiress.

156
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,340
Oh, my.

157
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,340
I am so sorry, Madeline.

158
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:36,340
Please, you don't have to apologize Mrs. Moss.

159
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,340
Oh, no, no.

160
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:39,340
Please, call me Bunny.

161
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,340
And come here.

162
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:42,340
Give me a hug.

163
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:47,730
First time this bitch has ever hugged me.

164
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:51,909
Luke, forget everything I said earlier.

165
00:14:51,909 --> 00:14:53,909
And Madeline, please.

166
00:14:53,909 --> 00:14:56,909
I would love to have you and Luke over for lunch tomorrow.

167
00:14:56,909 --> 00:14:59,909
Oh, and bring your brother Felix over as well.

168
00:14:59,909 --> 00:15:00,909
Sure thing.

169
00:15:00,909 --> 00:15:01,909
Bunny.

170
00:15:01,909 --> 00:15:12,100
They're good looking.

171
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:15,149
What do you want?

172
00:15:15,149 --> 00:15:21,750
When much just came to ask you out on a date?

173
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:22,750
Really?

174
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:23,879
A date?

175
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:27,100
It's my brother.

176
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,610
Oh.

177
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:31,639
Luke's mom invited us to lunch tomorrow.

178
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:36,639
And what is the reason for inviting your brother?

179
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:43,639
Well, I need them to buy this whole plan so that I can drain them of every punny that

180
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:50,820
asshole and that old bitch have bankrupt them.

181
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:55,820
But don't have any idea how.

182
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,039
Any ideas?

183
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,200
Easy.

184
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:02,200
It just convinced them to go all in on a stock which will soon collapse.

185
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:08,549
Oh, it's stock.

186
00:16:08,549 --> 00:16:09,549
You know what?

187
00:16:09,549 --> 00:16:12,549
I'm a little too tired to think.

188
00:16:12,549 --> 00:16:17,549
I wish I could somehow get a massage that would just help me clear my head.

189
00:16:17,549 --> 00:16:18,549
A massage.

190
00:16:18,549 --> 00:16:19,549
A little down.

191
00:16:19,549 --> 00:16:34,250
And then left.

192
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,210
Here.

193
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:37,690
Right there.

194
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:38,690
Right there.

195
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:39,690
Oh, yeah.

196
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:40,690
Ow.

197
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:41,690
Ow.

198
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:43,549
Still sleeping?

199
00:16:43,549 --> 00:16:44,549
All right.

200
00:16:44,549 --> 00:16:46,379
Come on.

201
00:16:46,379 --> 00:16:47,899
What stock?

202
00:16:47,899 --> 00:16:48,899
Don't worry.

203
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:54,570
I got you.

204
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:57,659
Welcome you to Mr. Raphael.

205
00:16:57,659 --> 00:17:00,659
What an honor it is to have you here.

206
00:17:00,659 --> 00:17:02,110
Mike.

207
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:05,529
Your sister is one beautiful woman.

208
00:17:05,529 --> 00:17:07,589
Did you know that?

209
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:15,000
Why couldn't you have married someone like Madeline and not that peasant fool of Olivia?

210
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Oh, Mom.

211
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Don't you worry about that.

212
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,799
Please.

213
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:20,799
Come in.

214
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:33,150
So, Felix, what are you currently working on?

215
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:38,150
Actually, my company is currently heavily investing in logos time.

216
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:40,539
Well, that's a publicly traded company, isn't it?

217
00:17:40,539 --> 00:17:43,819
It sure is.

218
00:17:43,819 --> 00:17:48,819
Why do you want to invest in that company if I may ask?

219
00:17:48,819 --> 00:17:52,910
I'm not sure I can share that information.

220
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:53,910
Oh.

221
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:55,910
We're friends, aren't we?

222
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:57,390
Come on.

223
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:59,390
Felix, you can trust Bunny.

224
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:05,250
And look, they're solid people.

225
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:13,079
Well, in sight of where it is, they're about to finalize a revolutionary AI algorithm that

226
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:16,079
kind of drastically improves machine learning capabilities.

227
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:25,039
And this algorithm has the potential, in fact, is expected to be a game changer in AI.

228
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:28,230
There's billions to be made.

229
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:35,619
You can't tell anyone.

230
00:18:35,619 --> 00:18:37,619
And I mean anyone about this.

231
00:18:37,619 --> 00:18:40,670
We promise.

232
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:43,670
See, I told you you could trust them.

233
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:56,069
You think they bought it?

234
00:18:56,069 --> 00:18:58,170
About the logo's check investment?

235
00:18:58,170 --> 00:18:59,579
Absolutely.

236
00:19:00,579 --> 00:19:03,779
Now, the question is whether they invest their end.

237
00:19:03,779 --> 00:19:21,640
Hey, Mom.

238
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,789
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?

239
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:25,890
What?

240
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:26,890
The logo's desktop.

241
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:34,079
Felix mentioned I invested a few million last night, and the stock is already up 200%.

242
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:36,079
200%.

243
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:38,009
Wow.

244
00:19:38,009 --> 00:19:39,009
Okay.

245
00:19:39,009 --> 00:19:40,009
Okay.

246
00:19:40,009 --> 00:19:41,009
Listen to me, Mom.

247
00:19:41,009 --> 00:19:44,009
I need you to put all of your money into that stock.

248
00:19:44,009 --> 00:19:45,009
All right?

249
00:19:45,009 --> 00:19:46,170
All of it.

250
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:47,170
You sure?

251
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:48,170
Absolutely.

252
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:57,940
Listen to me.

253
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:06,710
I need you to invest all of the company's cash reserves into logo's tech stock.

254
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:07,710
Vuk.

255
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:12,710
Well, frankly, that sounds like a very risky idea.

256
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:13,710
What if the stock fails?

257
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:14,710
God, trust me.

258
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:15,710
I have insider information.

259
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:18,710
You have no idea how crazy the profit will be.

260
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:23,710
The profit from this investment will finally silence the board of directors.

261
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:25,710
And that means I'll remain CEO for good.

262
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:30,819
Hey, CEO for good.

263
00:20:30,819 --> 00:20:32,910
Make it happen.

264
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:33,910
Yeah, okay.

265
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:42,240
Hello, boss.

266
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,609
Happy today.

267
00:20:45,609 --> 00:20:48,609
Oh, it's a fabulous day, Madeline.

268
00:20:48,609 --> 00:20:49,609
Fabulous.

269
00:20:49,609 --> 00:20:54,609
Oh, by the way, I wanted to make sure you were coming to our annual company party this Friday.

270
00:20:54,609 --> 00:20:55,609
I'm there.

271
00:20:55,609 --> 00:20:56,609
100%.

272
00:20:56,609 --> 00:20:57,609
Great.

273
00:20:57,609 --> 00:20:59,609
And make sure you invite your brother, huh?

274
00:20:59,609 --> 00:21:32,450
It's a shame.

275
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:35,430
What?

276
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:38,230
That I'm just your brother?

277
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:43,049
What else did you want?

278
00:21:43,049 --> 00:21:45,109
Oh, you have no idea.

279
00:21:45,109 --> 00:21:47,710
Come on.

280
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:49,710
Let's go get those fools.

281
00:21:49,710 --> 00:22:09,910
There you are.

282
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:12,839
My God, you look gorgeous.

283
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:25,309
Mind if I borrow her for a minute?

284
00:22:25,309 --> 00:22:28,049
Is everything all right?

285
00:22:28,049 --> 00:22:29,049
More than all right.

286
00:22:29,049 --> 00:22:35,829
Ever since I met you, Madeline, my life has completely changed.

287
00:22:35,829 --> 00:22:38,829
I feel like a new and better man.

288
00:22:38,829 --> 00:22:41,829
And because of that, I wanted to do this.

289
00:22:41,829 --> 00:22:45,339
Will you marry me?

290
00:22:45,339 --> 00:22:48,839
Are you out of your fucking mind?

291
00:22:48,839 --> 00:23:10,609
Me too.

292
00:23:10,609 --> 00:23:11,609
You are a pathetic...

293
00:23:11,609 --> 00:23:13,250
Oh, digging.

294
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:14,980
She's right.

295
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:17,980
I always knew you were a gold digger trying to steal my fortune.

296
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,980
I can't believe I married you.

297
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,980
I can't believe I married you.

298
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:22,980
You cheating asshole?

299
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:25,980
Well, it doesn't matter now because we're getting a divorce.

300
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:28,980
I'm having my lawyer draft up the paperwork as we speak.

301
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:29,980
Luke, no.

302
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:30,980
Please come on.

303
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,369
Oh, all right.

304
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:33,369
Fine.

305
00:23:33,369 --> 00:23:37,799
What do you mean fine?

306
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:39,799
This is for you to disappear from my life.

307
00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:40,799
Forever.

308
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:43,619
No.

309
00:23:43,619 --> 00:23:49,039
You are not doing the exact same thing to me that you did to your ex-wife.

310
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,359
You dumped your ex-wife for her.

311
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:54,609
This is all your fault.

312
00:23:54,609 --> 00:23:56,609
You stupid psychic.

313
00:23:56,609 --> 00:23:57,609
You stole mine!

314
00:23:57,609 --> 00:24:00,539
Stole your man.

315
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:03,859
Sounds like you're the one that stole that poor woman's man.

316
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:06,180
And you.

317
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:09,200
You cheated on your wife for three years.

318
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,200
Only to treat her like a dog when you dumped her.

319
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,200
Because she was a little overweight.

320
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,200
Blimpy Butterball.

321
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,200
Madeline.

322
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:23,650
What are you talking about?

323
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:25,650
Whoever told you that is lying.

324
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:26,650
That's not true.

325
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:27,650
Madeline.

326
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:28,650
Come on.

327
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:32,650
Pay no attention to that nonsense gossip.

328
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:34,650
My son is a good man.

329
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:36,650
And he will treat you right.

330
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:37,650
That's what counts.

331
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:38,650
She's absolutely right.

332
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:40,650
And not to mention.

333
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:44,779
You are the ultimate upgrade from that thing over there.

334
00:24:44,779 --> 00:24:46,779
I knew at the moment I met you.

335
00:24:46,779 --> 00:24:49,779
A classy and beautiful woman.

336
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:52,640
What are you looking at?

337
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,640
And why are you still wearing that ring?

338
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,640
It's no longer yours.

339
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,680
Here, look.

340
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:06,240
This belongs to Madeline.

341
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,240
Thank you, Mother.

342
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,240
Wait.

343
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,240
Is this just me or does this seem really familiar to you?

344
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,240
For sure.

345
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,240
Remember a few months ago?

346
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,240
It was literally right there.

347
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,880
But it looks like this time the roles have reversed for that woman.

348
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,259
Baby.

349
00:25:22,259 --> 00:25:23,259
Trust me.

350
00:25:23,259 --> 00:25:25,900
I'll treat you like a queen.

351
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:29,470
My dead body!

352
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:30,470
No!

353
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:38,579
I'm great!

354
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:40,220
Jesus!

355
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:42,220
She's just pretending to be an heiress.

356
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:44,220
What is she talking about?

357
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:47,400
Listen, Mom.

358
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,400
It's true that Madeline is an illegitimate child.

359
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,400
But she still belongs to the Raphael family.

360
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,400
Isn't that right, Madeline?

361
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,910
Actually, I don't.

362
00:25:57,910 --> 00:26:00,390
I'm not a part of the Raphael family.

363
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:05,099
And Felix?

364
00:26:05,099 --> 00:26:07,519
He's at my brother.

365
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:12,809
And?

366
00:26:12,809 --> 00:26:15,670
Fat ex-wife of yours.

367
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:20,200
You're looking at her.

368
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,200
My God, is that that fat girl from last year?

369
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,200
No, it can't be.

370
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:27,670
Good one.

371
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:28,670
Very funny.

372
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:36,380
Madeline, if I could kindly remind you that this is no place or time for a joke like this.

373
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:38,380
Well, I'm not joking.

374
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:45,269
I may have lost all the weight, but I'm still the same person you humiliated and mocked.

375
00:26:45,269 --> 00:26:59,019
Unmaddy Moss.

376
00:26:59,019 --> 00:27:00,019
No.

377
00:27:00,019 --> 00:27:01,019
No way.

378
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:03,200
That's impossible.

379
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,619
It's really me.

380
00:27:04,619 --> 00:27:10,319
And now I've come back to make sure you all pay for your evil deeds.

381
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:12,450
I knew it.

382
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:14,450
You disgusting tub of larb.

383
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:17,990
You were stupid enough to fall for her.

384
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:32,190
I guess it's what you deserve.

385
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:33,190
What?

386
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:34,190
It's the stock.

387
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:35,190
The price is collapsed.

388
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:37,190
It's not even worth five cents a share.

389
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:41,980
You're saying this stock is worthless?

390
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:49,839
I don't know what we're going to do.

391
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:50,839
The company's insolvent.

392
00:27:50,839 --> 00:27:59,980
We are going under.

393
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:00,980
You did this.

394
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:01,980
You're responsible.

395
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,549
And you.

396
00:28:03,549 --> 00:28:05,869
You've played me.

397
00:28:05,869 --> 00:28:06,869
Like a flute.

398
00:28:06,869 --> 00:28:12,670
You touch even a hair of hers, I will break you in two.

399
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:14,150
You finished.

400
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,279
Broke.

401
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:19,720
That's not even the worst of it, is it Felix?

402
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,720
Indeed.

403
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,720
Looks like you're going to have to lawyer up.

404
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:28,720
Your misappropriation of corporate funds is going to land you in jail for half a lifetime.

405
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:35,539
You take one more step and will ensure the other half.

406
00:28:35,539 --> 00:28:38,539
Can't wait to sign the divorce papers.

407
00:28:38,539 --> 00:28:40,539
I'm going to take everything you have.

408
00:28:40,539 --> 00:28:43,369
There's nothing to have.

409
00:28:43,369 --> 00:28:44,690
What do you mean?

410
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:49,710
I invested all of my personal fortune into that stock.

411
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:53,750
What?

412
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:54,750
It's gone.

413
00:28:54,750 --> 00:29:02,900
All of it.

414
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:32,200
A few weeks ago there was something you wanted to ask me, but you didn't.

415
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,200
I remember.

416
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,960
Tell me now.

417
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:40,599
It's not so much something I wanted to say.

418
00:29:40,599 --> 00:29:43,140
It's not just something I wanted to do.

419
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:44,140
And what was that?
