00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
Hey, you're gonna be a doctor, okay? Let me call 911.

2
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:10,720
Do you want to eat? Do you want to eat? Is that true for you?

3
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:14,720
I just want to eat.

4
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,839
Oh, no. It's too late.

5
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:20,239
I don't. Don't say that.

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,600
I'm so sorry. I should have been there. I thought all these news that you were happy.

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,320
It would have happened in a minute, but if I had a moment, it was really like this.

8
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,359
I would have done something. I would have stopped the wedding.

9
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:35,920
Shannon, I would have taken you for Ricky Trax.

10
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,560
I'm so sorry. I should have done more, Shannon. I should have done more.

11
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:48,829
I could never imagine someone other than me. I bothered to be so kind to me.

12
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:56,579
I'm such a fool. Let our heartless burn in my life. I'm a fool. I'm a fool.

13
00:01:00,219 --> 00:01:04,620
In my next life, I will choose to forgive my next life.

14
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,799
I will be sure you are the happiest woman in the world.

15
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:22,129
Shannon, Shannon, Shannon, Shannon!
