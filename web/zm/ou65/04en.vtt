00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.919
This is college? How can this be? I've been reborn ten years ago.

2
00:00:08.919 --> 00:00:16.309
I thought it would be great to meet her.

3
00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:17.309
I would be good.

4
00:00:17.309 --> 00:00:39.750
I told you to buy a lunch for Karen. Not some trash that you and your people leave. Something edible.

5
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:48.420
Ricky tracks. In my previous life, I gave you everything only for you to betray and murder me.

6
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.420
This time, it'll be different.

7
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.509
Are you deaf? Go. Now.

8
00:00:54.509 --> 00:00:57.509
Ricky, it's just best if I go myself.

9
00:00:57.509 --> 00:00:59.509
Don't even go.

10
00:00:59.509 --> 00:01:04.510
She feels more value. Certain people like me and you as compared to her.

11
00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.510
People that she calls her family.

12
00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:12.019
Am I right? Jen?

13
00:01:12.019 --> 00:01:14.019
Let this meal start my revenge.

14
00:01:14.019 --> 00:01:30.849
Thatching lunch for your master again?

15
00:01:30.849 --> 00:01:34.849
With brilliant girls like Karen around?

16
00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:39.069
Ricky won't waste a glance on your kind.

17
00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:41.069
You know that, right?

18
00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:44.069
Yeah, and what is my kind?

19
00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:48.260
You're the daughter of his maid kind?

20
00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.260
That follows him to school every...

21
00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.310
The wishes.

22
00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.310
She can marry a rich kind.

23
00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:07.819
If you're lucky, you can make his bed, sweep his floor and scrub his toilet kind. You know, you're kind.

24
00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:13.819
Ricky tracks tell you that. Did he tell you that his maid back?

25
00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.919
Is my family car? And that he is the son of...

26
00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:22.330
My driver?

27
00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.330
What a psycho!

28
00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.330
Barking like a chihuahua just because Ricky won't look at you?

29
00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.330
Hurry up.

30
00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.060
Your master's lunch is getting cold.

31
00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.060
The driver's son is saying I'm his maid.

32
00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.060
Ricky tracks, you're gonna pay for that.
