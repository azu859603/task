00:00:01,169 --> 00:00:13,279
I told you to buy lunch for Karen and you ate it, mind to God, you are just such a...

2
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:14,279
Hey, aren't you?

3
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:19,280
I spent this with my own money, two meals or twenty meals, what's it to do with you?

4
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,280
Your money?

5
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:24,280
Even if you spend it, it still tracks as money, dumb.

6
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,280
Who is that so?

7
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,500
Who's money?

8
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:32,820
I think getting lunch when you're told to, from your boss,

9
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:40,820
is a simple task, and you came up with me with something so simple, that you just be fucking stupid.

10
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,820
You want to use my boss first?

11
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:47,859
A completely able-body woman too lazy to get her lunch?

12
00:00:47,859 --> 00:00:49,979
I think she deserves the tummy ache.

13
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:50,979
You?

14
00:00:50,979 --> 00:00:53,979
You are a tracks family maid.

15
00:00:53,979 --> 00:00:56,979
Taking care of his girlfriend is literally your job.

16
00:00:56,979 --> 00:00:58,979
Is that so hard to comprehend?

17
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:01,979
When he tracks, am I a maid?

18
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:04,530
Alright, she had me.

19
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:09,819
I don't know what game you're playing, but I'm not doing it.

20
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:14,819
Don't cause any trouble, otherwise I will not forgive you no matter how hard you bite.

21
00:01:14,819 --> 00:01:16,849
Buddy?

22
00:01:16,849 --> 00:01:18,849
Why would I, what did I do?

23
00:01:18,849 --> 00:01:22,200
You're so tough, don't you?

24
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,200
It's crazy how quickly you just lost a seat in the car.

25
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,200
I can care less if you welcome.

26
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:32,780
Your car?

27
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:36,780
It was never yours, and it's time you learned your place.
