00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:20.559
After insulting Ricky and Karen, she still has a nerve to keep freeloading rides, unbelievable.

2
00:00:20.559 --> 00:00:23.559
A maid's daughter acting like a princess.

3
00:00:23.559 --> 00:00:25.559
Ricky is too quiet.

4
00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:29.559
If it was me, I would have kicked around already.

5
00:00:29.559 --> 00:00:32.070
Drive.

6
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.070
Let's wait for Ricky.

7
00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.960
Mr. Trax, you work for my father and me.

8
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.280
I think I can say who we wait on.

9
00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.280
Do you guys have a fight or something?

10
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.280
Look, I'll have a word with him for sure.

11
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.280
But could you try to be a little nicer to him?

12
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.280
I mean, I know you like to look down at him.

13
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.280
Mr. Trax, can you just drive?

14
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.280
I don't want him in my car.

15
00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.280
I don't want him at my house.

16
00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.280
I just, I don't want to see him anymore.

17
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.310
Well, let's just, let's just be.

18
00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.310
Drive or not?

19
00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.310
She's usually so scared of Ricky.

20
00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.379
What's going on today?

21
00:01:08.379 --> 00:01:11.379
Did you forget on her future father-in-law?

22
00:01:11.379 --> 00:01:14.379
Or the fact my son will take over her father's business?

23
00:01:14.379 --> 00:01:16.379
Mr. Trax, I ask politely.

24
00:01:16.379 --> 00:01:18.379
Look, they're coming right now.
