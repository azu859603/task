1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,430
What the hell are you doing?

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:05,429
You'd expect a free ride in my car to insult me?

3
00:00:06,849 --> 00:00:09,849
That's Ricky tracks his family's car.

4
00:00:09,849 --> 00:00:11,849
Why is he letting that bitch do that to him?

5
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:14,849
That's what you get for letting the maid drive in the car.

6
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:17,850
If you give a mouse a cookie, come on, Ricky!

7
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:18,850
Pull her out!

8
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:20,850
Why do you have to act like this?

9
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:23,850
Look, I'll forgive you about lunch.

10
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:24,850
I don't want your forgiveness.

11
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:26,850
You can walk over all I can.

12
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:28,850
Stop following me.

13
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:34,450
I have to get in the car, or I'll be exposed.

14
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:36,450
If anyone knows I'm the son of the driver,

15
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:41,140
it'll be helpful.

16
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:55,740
Ricky helped him drag me out of my own car.

17
00:01:02,689 --> 00:01:06,689
It's job Ricky dealing with that ungrateful low life.

18
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:08,689
That's exactly what she deserved.

19
00:01:08,689 --> 00:01:10,689
Ricky is so cool.

20
00:01:10,689 --> 00:01:13,689
Dad, our driver forgot what we worked for.

21
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:18,140
Calling Ricky, asking for forgiveness.

22
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,810
It's too late.

23
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:24,810
The only one bad game for forgiveness is him.

24
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:25,810
Watch.

25
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:27,810
My car's about to pull back.

26
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,560
Get out.

27
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,200
Shannon, please get in the car.

28
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,200
I'll take you wherever you want.
