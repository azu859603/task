00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Even Ricky's driver respects the maid's daughter? It does not make any sense.

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Why is Ricky getting out?

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.449
Shannon, was it really necessary for you to bother your father like that?

4
00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:16.449
I mean, he's a very busy man.

5
00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:19.449
Oh, from now on, those two are not allowed in this car.

6
00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:22.449
Uh, that's a little childish, Shannon?

7
00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:26.449
If you were not that close to use my name, remember who pays you.

8
00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:32.450
Plus, I think a driver being asked to drive is a simple task.

9
00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.450
If you can't handle it, feel free to quit.

10
00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:41.770
You're right, I was wrong. I'm driving right now.

11
00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.770
Shannon, that's enough.

12
00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.770
Oh, it looks like the young master is mad.

13
00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.770
Shannon, I get it if you don't like me, but you don't have to be a bully to Ricky.

14
00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.770
He's always been so nice to you.

15
00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.770
He even had the driver come back just for you.

16
00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.770
You don't have to be so mean.

17
00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.770
You know what? You don't even have to explain yourself to her.

18
00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.769
She has never learned a single thing of gratitude in her entire life.

19
00:01:06.769 --> 00:01:10.769
And you just continue to keep crossing the line every time.
