00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:09,109
Oh, there is a line to cross. I had no idea, but this is just the beginning, Ricky tracks, Karen.

2
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:10,109
Bye.

3
00:00:10,109 --> 00:00:12,429
Driver, drive.

4
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:19,929
Where's your bag?

5
00:00:19,929 --> 00:00:23,019
No one. Where's your friend, Ricky?

6
00:00:23,019 --> 00:00:27,019
Oh, Aunt Jo. From now on, I don't have any friends named Ricky.

7
00:00:27,019 --> 00:00:31,379
Yes, you'll finally come to your senses.

8
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:34,380
Aunt Jo was the kindness of all servants in the house.

9
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:40,380
In my past life, she always warned me about Ricky, but I was so blindly in love that I pushed her away.

10
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,380
In this life, I won't fail her again.

11
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:45,380
Miss, I'm so sorry. I spoke out of turn.

12
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:48,380
Oh, no, Aunt Jo. It's okay. You're absolutely right.

13
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:51,380
I think I'm gonna lay down, though. It's been a long day.

14
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:52,380
All right.

15
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:58,049
Johnny Wonder came by for a visit. I can send him away if you're too tired.

16
00:00:58,049 --> 00:01:01,179
Johnny? Where is he?
