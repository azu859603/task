00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:03.520
Johnny?

2
00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:08.849
This is 20 year old Johnny.

3
00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:10.849
The fiance my father arranged for me.

4
00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:15.039
In my past life because of Ricky Trax, I ignored him.

5
00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:18.039
And he only wanted to be with me, but I only wanted Ricky.

6
00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:24.609
I not only refused him, but I also said hurtful things to him.

7
00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:26.609
It's really nice to see you again.

8
00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.609
Miss Clark, it's a pleasure to see you.

9
00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.380
Is there a reason why you came?

10
00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.049
Actually, I came because I wanted to see you.

11
00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:42.210
But I can see that you're a busy woman, so I won't keep you up.

12
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:50.299
Johnny, do you want to have dinner with me?

13
00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:51.299
Really?

14
00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:54.299
Yeah, I mean, on Joe's a pretty good chef.

15
00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:56.619
Okay.

16
00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:58.619
Let's go.
