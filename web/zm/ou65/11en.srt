1
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:10,660
Alright, Ancho, I think it's time to start dinner.

2
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:12,660
We're not waiting for Ricky.

3
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,039
Why?

4
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:20,019
Say, goodness, Ms. Shannon won't be a suck-up anymore.

5
00:00:20,019 --> 00:00:22,420
I'll have everything ready right away.

6
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:24,989
Thank you.

7
00:00:24,989 --> 00:00:31,179
Yes.

8
00:00:31,179 --> 00:00:34,179
Johnny, your grades have been good in school, right?

9
00:00:34,179 --> 00:00:37,179
Well, yeah, I mean, I studied my part, so, yeah.

10
00:00:37,179 --> 00:00:38,179
Well, mine are terrible.

11
00:00:38,179 --> 00:00:39,179
Man.

12
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:41,179
Would you want to be my tutor?

13
00:00:41,179 --> 00:00:45,179
I mean, you could just come here every day and help me study.

14
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:49,820
Well, I thought the Ricky tracks isn't you.

15
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,820
And you love him so much that you push me away.

16
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,820
Oh, well, he's about to get fired, so...

17
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:01,829
Well, well, well, hey, I mean, I'm available.

18
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:03,829
And if you won't, you're going to be such a marvel.

19
00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:05,829
Yeah, tomorrow then.

20
00:01:05,829 --> 00:01:06,829
Yeah, tomorrow?

21
00:01:06,829 --> 00:01:07,829
Yeah.

22
00:01:07,829 --> 00:01:09,019
Okay.

23
00:01:09,019 --> 00:01:13,019
Hey, Ancho, I'm really sorry, but I have to run.

24
00:01:13,019 --> 00:01:14,019
Something came up.

25
00:01:14,019 --> 00:01:16,019
But thank you for having me here.

26
00:01:16,019 --> 00:01:17,019
Tomorrow.

27
00:01:17,019 --> 00:01:18,180
Tomorrow?

28
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,180
My...

29
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:40,090
Shannon?

30
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:44,090
Why did you think he was a good idea to tell my father a new one today?

31
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:45,090
Huh?

32
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:46,090
They found out everybody.

33
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:47,090
What is wrong with you?

34
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:50,090
Go out there and apologize to him, right now.

35
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:53,090
Hey, I disciplined my driver.

36
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:58,090
I paid his salary and he left me on the side of the road, and yet you weren't able to apologize?

37
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:03,090
He is my father, and he had nothing to do with any of this.

38
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,090
Anything he did, but I told him to.

39
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:07,090
He went out of this.

40
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:10,090
If you ever come, you can take it off of me.

41
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:12,090
I see how it is.

42
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:16,090
Daddy only listens to you, in that case.

43
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:22,349
You can both pack your bags and go.

44
00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:26,680
Ricky?

45
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,680
I can't have you here anymore.

46
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,680
Ever since you started tutoring me, my grades have only gotten worse.

47
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,680
Why am I paying you anything at all?

48
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,680
Because you're fucking...

49
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,680
Oh, that's fucking why.

50
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,680
I explained the same shit to Karen.

51
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,680
What does I explain to you to pick up the information?

52
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,680
No problem.

53
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,680
You're dumb.

54
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,680
As rocks.

55
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,680
Search for anything.

56
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,680
I don't.

57
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:55,060
But do not keep falling back on me when the grades are looking worse than they already are.

58
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,060
Fine.

59
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,060
You will.

60
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,060
But I want you and you're good for nothing, father.

61
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:02,659
I live here.

62
00:03:02,659 --> 00:03:03,699
You know what?

63
00:03:03,699 --> 00:03:04,699
You're right.

64
00:03:04,699 --> 00:03:07,180
It's not because you're fucking stupid.

65
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,460
It's because you're obsessed with it.

66
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,460
You want to go out with it.

67
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,460
You can't focus.

68
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:14,460
And that's why your grades are so good.

69
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,460
I think you're talking about...

70
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:19,460
This little fuss that you're creating.

71
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:22,460
It's because you're jealous of me and Karen's relationship, right?

72
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,460
You think I want to be with you?

73
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,689
Oh my God.

74
00:03:26,689 --> 00:03:28,689
It's obvious.

75
00:03:28,689 --> 00:03:29,979
Oh.

76
00:03:29,979 --> 00:03:31,979
Ricky tracks.

77
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:35,680
In this life, I would never want to be with you.

78
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,319
Sorry.

79
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:40,319
Well, you can say whatever.

80
00:03:40,319 --> 00:04:02,620
But if you disrespect me like that, ever again in public, whatever happens to you next is completely your fault.

81
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,909
Did you be able to drop Karen off first?

82
00:04:04,909 --> 00:04:05,909
All right.

83
00:04:05,909 --> 00:04:06,909
My boy.

84
00:04:06,909 --> 00:04:07,909
I'm a driver.

85
00:04:07,909 --> 00:04:09,939
You did not ask for my...

86
00:04:09,939 --> 00:04:14,189
From now on, no unnecessary people in my car, including him.

87
00:04:14,189 --> 00:04:21,079
Miss Shannon.

88
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:24,079
You have a good relationship with Ricky, right?

89
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:29,079
I would want to let something small like this get in the way of your feelings for him.

90
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:32,079
This time I checked, your job description was a driver.

91
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:35,009
Do you want to pursue therapy?

92
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:37,009
That's probably why you didn't do...

93
00:04:37,009 --> 00:04:38,009
Oh.

94
00:04:38,009 --> 00:04:40,009
You probably want to do well in med school.

95
00:04:40,009 --> 00:04:42,009
Is that why you're behind the wheel?

96
00:04:42,009 --> 00:04:43,009
Don't talk to my fuck.

97
00:04:43,009 --> 00:04:48,300
My driver like that.

98
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,300
Get out.

99
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,300
What?

100
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,300
What?

101
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:56,180
Oh dear, you think you're worthy enough to sit with me.

102
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,180
Drive!

103
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:04,279
Shannon, you've really crossed the line this time.

104
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:07,279
You've officially pissed me the fuck off.

105
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:09,279
Ricky, what is going on with you?

106
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:13,279
She's the daughter of your driver and you're letting her push you around like this?

107
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:18,100
Everyone says you're the rich one and she's the fake.

108
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,139
Maybe they're wrong.

109
00:05:20,139 --> 00:05:28,540
So, I heard you were talking to Johnny Wonder.

110
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,540
Why do you care?

111
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:30,540
No.

112
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:37,540
Bringing him around and trying to make me jealous is never going to get him to forgive you if that's what you think.

113
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,540
I want to think that.

114
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,540
I mean, I don't even like thinking about you.

115
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:46,040
You know what I can't stand?

116
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,040
Women who can't make up there.

117
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:51,769
I've made up my mind about you.

118
00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:57,199
Actually, I can't believe I've tolerated you for so long.

119
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,230
But the way you treat me and spend my money on me.

120
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:02,230
Aaron?

121
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:08,129
Money?

122
00:06:08,129 --> 00:06:11,129
I've heard of that mind to fix your dumb ass brain.

123
00:06:11,129 --> 00:06:15,259
Well, then maybe I should demand a refund and my grades would go up.

124
00:06:15,259 --> 00:06:18,259
Well, it's not my fault. It's your mind.

125
00:06:18,259 --> 00:06:19,259
Ricky, you're fired.

126
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:20,259
What?

127
00:06:20,259 --> 00:06:21,259
You do find someone else?

128
00:06:21,259 --> 00:06:24,259
Don't worry, I already found a new tutor.

129
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:27,399
You know,

130
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:29,430
you're playing hard to get.

131
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,430
It's just not a thing to fix on me.

132
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:35,430
And if you keep it up, you're just going to lose me as a tutor.

133
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:38,430
And, well, are you with that lead or shame?

134
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:41,529
I'm the dumb one.

135
00:06:41,529 --> 00:06:46,779
Ricky, you're fired.

136
00:06:46,779 --> 00:06:49,660
You?

137
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:53,459
Ricky, what's really going on between you and Shannon?

138
00:06:53,459 --> 00:06:55,459
Who knows you? I don't give a shit.

139
00:06:55,459 --> 00:06:58,740
Well, it's your birthday tomorrow.

140
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,740
Are we still celebrating with your family about it?

141
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,060
Are you going to help me write a dress?

142
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,060
Ricky?

143
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,290
Ricky?

144
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:08,540
No, you...

145
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,540
I'll write a dress.

146
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,579
You don't even know.

147
00:07:12,579 --> 00:07:14,819
Me?

148
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:16,949
That's what's going on.

149
00:07:16,949 --> 00:07:18,949
Shannon always plays my birthday celebrations.

150
00:07:18,949 --> 00:07:21,949
She's just acting dramatic behind the surprise.

151
00:07:21,949 --> 00:07:25,050
Oh, she's taking it too far.

152
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:30,050
Shannon, do you want me to birthday party to get my drinking this?

153
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:33,040
Ricky, why aren't you saying anything?

154
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:36,670
What's the note, everyone?

155
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:39,670
Tomorrow night is my 20th birthday.

156
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:42,670
It will be held at the Royal Court Hotel.

157
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,670
There will be food.

158
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:45,670
There will be drinks.

159
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:47,670
There will be music.

160
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:50,740
And, well, it will be a night to remember.

161
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:53,740
Oh, my God, the Royal Court Hotel?

162
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:56,740
That is, like, higher than five stars.

163
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:00,899
The track's family owns the Royal Court.

164
00:08:00,899 --> 00:08:03,540
The staff literally found...

165
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:05,540
...to Ricky.

166
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:06,540
Holy shit.

167
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:08,540
Yes, you do have to get me a ticket.

168
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:10,540
Get yourself a ticket?

169
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,540
No, no, no, no.

170
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:14,699
You see, you're personally invited.

171
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:22,100
Actually, as a matter of fact, everybody here is invited.

172
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:25,100
Ricky, should we invite Shannon?

173
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,100
Do you think she'll come?

174
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,100
Shannon?

175
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,100
No.

176
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,100
Even without invitation, she'll still come around.

177
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:34,669
Shannon, you think you're so clever.

178
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:36,669
You think this party will save you?

179
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:37,830
No.

180
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:39,929
You're in for a rude awakening.

181
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:41,929
Nobody disrespects me.

182
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:44,929
Yeah, she can't seem to stay away from you.

183
00:08:44,929 --> 00:08:48,340
I'll have to teach her and listen.

184
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:51,340
God, Johnny is nothing like Ricky.

185
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,340
Johnny has patience.

186
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,340
He speaks well.

187
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,340
He never complains.

188
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:58,340
And, oh, my God, he's handsome.

189
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:01,340
How could I have been so blind in my previous life?

190
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:04,340
How could I waste all my time on someone like Ricky tracks,

191
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:07,340
especially when Johnny was right there all along?

192
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:10,549
Is there something you don't understand?

193
00:09:10,549 --> 00:09:13,549
Oh, no, I'm just too dumb.

194
00:09:13,549 --> 00:09:15,549
Shannon, you are not dumb.

195
00:09:15,549 --> 00:09:17,549
Just, you have a bad study, Matt.

196
00:09:17,549 --> 00:09:21,029
I'll tell you what, let me help you build a better foundation,

197
00:09:21,029 --> 00:09:23,029
and then if your grades still don't improve,

198
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:25,029
you can kick me to the curb,

199
00:09:25,029 --> 00:09:27,029
and look, I won't even keep the money that you pay.

200
00:09:27,029 --> 00:09:28,029
Are you sure?

201
00:09:28,029 --> 00:09:30,029
I mean, do you really mean all that?

202
00:09:30,029 --> 00:09:31,029
Of course.

203
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:32,029
Here.

204
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:35,539
What you want to do is you want to find the most powerful denominator you can.

205
00:09:35,539 --> 00:09:36,539
Shannon, seriously?

206
00:09:36,539 --> 00:09:37,539
What's your deal?

207
00:09:37,539 --> 00:09:43,700
Ricky, what do you want?

208
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,700
You do my shit in the basement.

209
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:48,700
Well, yeah, because this afternoon I told you you're fired.

210
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,700
So why would you stay at my house,

211
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,700
especially in a nice room,

212
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:54,700
and especially after I fired your father?

213
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,700
If you're willing to stay, the basement is yours.

214
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,700
You must think it's so fun fucking humiliating me.

215
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,700
You really hate me?

216
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,789
You must have been so dramatic.

217
00:10:03,789 --> 00:10:05,789
I don't think I don't know what you're up to.

218
00:10:05,789 --> 00:10:07,789
Tomorrow at the birthday party,

219
00:10:07,789 --> 00:10:09,789
I'll make sure you regret this.

220
00:10:09,789 --> 00:10:12,789
I'll make your meal in front of everyone in apologies.

221
00:10:12,789 --> 00:10:16,620
Well, we're in the middle of a session,

222
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,620
so can you stop interrupting?

223
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,899
Well, just wait.

224
00:10:20,899 --> 00:10:34,120
Three, two, one.

225
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:44,019
What the hell is she doing?

226
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:47,860
Why is she acting so tough?

227
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:54,299
She's trying to make me angry.

228
00:10:54,299 --> 00:11:00,379
All right, I'll teach you a hard lesson for that.

229
00:11:00,379 --> 00:11:03,509
Hey, I'm really sorry you had to see that, Johnny.

230
00:11:03,509 --> 00:11:05,509
Maybe I should just go.

231
00:11:05,509 --> 00:11:08,509
I mean, you're not seeing like you're in the best mood, so.

232
00:11:08,509 --> 00:11:09,610
No, no, no.

233
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:11,610
Hey, I am in a good mood.

234
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:12,610
Are you sure?

235
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:14,610
By the way, what are you doing tomorrow night?

236
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:15,610
I don't know why.

237
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:19,610
Do you want to go to the Royal Court Hotel for dinner?

238
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:20,610
Yeah.

239
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:23,610
I haven't been in years and I miss the food.

240
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:24,610
Years.

241
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:26,610
Didn't you go with Ricky last night?

242
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:28,610
I mean, you guys seem to go there a lot, so.

243
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:30,610
Hey, now, how do you know that?

244
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:33,799
The Royal Court Hotel is my...

245
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:36,799
I was there too, I saw you guys.

246
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:39,799
Should I start avoiding you like before?

247
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:40,799
Do you want me to be with you?

248
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:41,799
No, of course not.

249
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:43,799
Okay, well then I'll see you tomorrow.

250
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:47,250
Okay, I'll see you then.

251
00:11:47,250 --> 00:12:17,779
Shannon, dare you show up here.

252
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:20,779
Excuse me, what are you even talking about?

253
00:12:20,779 --> 00:12:24,779
After everything, you have the nerve to come to Ricky's birthday party?

254
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:28,960
Oh, oh, it's his birthday?

255
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,919
You know what?

256
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:31,919
Totally forgot.

257
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:37,190
Now I remember.

258
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:41,190
Last time I spent a hundred K on that asshole's birthday party,

259
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:43,190
and when I was about to confess my feelings for him,

260
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:46,220
he shoved his tongue down Karen's throat.

261
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:51,220
Ugh, well, this time I'll get Ricky tracks an unforgettable birthday.

262
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:54,220
Oh, quit pretending.

263
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:58,220
Ricky didn't invite you, but you decided to show up anyway.

264
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:01,419
You're so... unclassy.

265
00:13:02,419 --> 00:13:04,419
Who do you think you are anyway?

266
00:13:04,419 --> 00:13:08,419
Are you, uh, Ricky's little bitch or Karen's?

267
00:13:08,419 --> 00:13:10,419
Oh, and I'm so sorry.

268
00:13:10,419 --> 00:13:12,419
I forgot your name, but only yours.

269
00:13:12,419 --> 00:13:14,419
Yap, yap, yap, yap.

270
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:16,419
Yancy, yap, yap.

271
00:13:16,419 --> 00:13:18,419
God, you're so annoying.

272
00:13:18,419 --> 00:13:23,139
Shannon, I'm surprised you showed.

273
00:13:23,139 --> 00:13:27,139
You know, throwing a little party like this is going to make me forgive you, Rick.

274
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,429
Oh, Ricky, tracks.

275
00:13:29,429 --> 00:13:32,429
You are something, thinking that everything is about you.

276
00:13:33,429 --> 00:13:35,429
You're telling me this isn't my birthday party?

277
00:13:35,429 --> 00:13:38,429
Ew, no, why would I throw a party for you?

278
00:13:38,429 --> 00:13:41,429
Unless Narcissists just waiting on the cake.

279
00:13:41,429 --> 00:13:42,429
And what's that supposed to mean?

280
00:13:42,429 --> 00:13:45,429
Shannon, it's Ricky's birthday, okay?

281
00:13:45,429 --> 00:13:47,429
Let's not make a scene.

282
00:13:47,429 --> 00:13:48,429
He's always been so nice to you.

283
00:13:48,429 --> 00:13:52,429
Even his family's treated you like a friend, not a servant, okay?

284
00:13:52,429 --> 00:13:55,139
Let's not make him angry.

285
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:59,700
Hey, don't get violent with Karen.

286
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:02,700
Alright, if you have a problem, you can take it up with me.

287
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:06,879
Shannon, you will apologize to Karen right now.

288
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:09,879
Ricky, it's my, just forget it.

289
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:10,879
It's your birthday.

290
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:13,139
I don't want to make a scene, and I...

291
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:15,139
Shannon did it a purpose.

292
00:14:15,139 --> 00:14:18,139
Are you going to apologize or not?

293
00:14:18,139 --> 00:14:21,139
I didn't push her, so why the fuck should I apologize?

294
00:14:21,139 --> 00:14:24,139
How dare you talk back to Ricky like that.

295
00:14:24,139 --> 00:14:26,139
You're such a monster.

296
00:14:26,139 --> 00:14:31,139
You hate yourself so much that you make fun of Karen because she's pretty and kind.

297
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:34,139
And that makes her an easy target for someone like you.

298
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:42,750
If Ricky won't beat you, I will.

299
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:45,750
You are Ricky's goddamn mate!

300
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,750
Someone needs to put you in your place.

301
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:54,350
Stop!

302
00:14:54,350 --> 00:15:00,230
You must have some kind of death, Rich.

303
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:04,600
What's wrong with you?

304
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,039
Donnie, you saved me again.

305
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:09,039
Again?

306
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:10,039
What do you mean again?

307
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:19,480
Shannon, get over here right now.

308
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:33,230
Don't touch her.

309
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:36,230
You didn't come here for a birthday party.

310
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:38,230
No, you came here for him.

311
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:41,230
I told you, I didn't like seeing you around him.

312
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:43,230
Ricky, what is wrong with you?

313
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:45,230
When you're lacking, you tried to kill me.

314
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:48,230
You didn't do anything, but now you get mad when someone tries to help me?

315
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:50,840
Don't ask your head.

316
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,840
My lacking?

317
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,840
Yancy would never hurt a fly.

318
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,840
You hit Karen first!

319
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:04,519
Pretty great.

320
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,710
But, you know, kind of embarrassing yourself here.

321
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:12,710
And you really don't want that, right?

322
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:20,139
You're putting me through all this shit because you want me to throw you a fucking birthday party?

323
00:16:20,139 --> 00:16:25,429
If being Karen bothers you, it's just too much for you to handle.

324
00:16:25,429 --> 00:16:30,429
Well, I could just easily step aside and then you could find the chill out.

325
00:16:30,429 --> 00:16:32,429
You're so pathetic.

326
00:16:32,429 --> 00:16:36,429
Can't let you a rich boy and let you get tarnished in front of everyone.

327
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:39,429
I'll play along and you'll see how it turns out.

328
00:16:39,429 --> 00:16:41,820
You know what?

329
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:42,820
I understand.

330
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:48,820
And I don't want to ruin anyone's fun, so I rented out the platinum lounge for your party.

331
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,820
I hope that's okay.

332
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:53,820
In the end, Shannon is still throwing me the party.

333
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,820
She really is my obedient little bitch.

334
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:59,940
And she will be forever.

335
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,940
You know what that does just fine?

336
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:04,940
Thank you so much, that means a lot to me.

337
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:06,940
Of course.

338
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:09,940
Everyone, there is nothing to see here.

339
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,940
Let's get this party wrong.

340
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:12,940
Come on.

341
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,359
Let's party.

342
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:20,359
Enjoy the rest of your night, Johnny.

343
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:22,869
Did you really hire out the platinum?

344
00:17:22,869 --> 00:17:23,869
God no.

345
00:17:23,869 --> 00:17:31,349
But it's Ricky's birthday party, so he might as well have some fun until he can't pay the bill.

346
00:17:31,349 --> 00:17:35,539
You know, I heard the owner of this hotel is a complete jackass.

347
00:17:35,539 --> 00:17:39,150
I wonder what he's going to do when he can't pay the bill.

348
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:40,150
My money?

349
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:41,150
He's going to break his legs.

350
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:47,049
Actually, I've heard that the owner of the Royal Court Hotel is not such a bad guy.

351
00:17:47,049 --> 00:17:48,049
Oh, man.

352
00:17:48,049 --> 00:17:49,049
What a shame.

353
00:17:49,049 --> 00:17:54,049
You know, I guess I could settle for him kneeling and begging for forgiveness.

354
00:17:54,049 --> 00:17:56,049
You're right.

355
00:17:56,049 --> 00:18:00,170
Thanks for saving me.

356
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:02,259
I owe you dinner.

357
00:18:02,259 --> 00:18:03,259
Let's go.

358
00:18:03,259 --> 00:18:04,259
Too high.

359
00:18:04,259 --> 00:18:08,700
Tabio, I saw straight from New Zealand.

360
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:12,579
Mr. Trax, the card's been declined.

361
00:18:12,579 --> 00:18:14,579
What do you mean my card's been declined?

362
00:18:14,579 --> 00:18:16,579
I mean, it's been declined.

363
00:18:16,579 --> 00:18:19,970
However, if you have another one, go about it that way.

364
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:23,500
Somebody else didn't pay for this already?

365
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,500
Shannon?

366
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,140
Oh, okay.

367
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,140
You look mad at this.

368
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,140
Is there something wrong?

369
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,140
I know.

370
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,140
You did this on purpose.

371
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,339
Don't worry.

372
00:18:34,339 --> 00:18:36,339
I'm not going to expose you yet.

373
00:18:36,339 --> 00:18:40,339
But just know your embarrassment is just the beginning.

374
00:18:40,339 --> 00:18:44,339
This is for our spread?

375
00:18:44,339 --> 00:18:45,339
Yes, sir.

376
00:18:45,339 --> 00:18:46,339
Thank you.

377
00:18:46,339 --> 00:18:47,539
Perfect.

378
00:18:47,539 --> 00:18:50,539
Mateo, I'd like to have George organize everything as usual.

379
00:18:50,539 --> 00:18:57,089
And tonight, please take a hundred out of Tilpiers.

380
00:18:57,089 --> 00:19:05,539
Well, since Ricky can't ask me nicely, I guess I'm just going to have to tell everyone the truth.

381
00:19:05,539 --> 00:19:06,539
Okay.

382
00:19:06,539 --> 00:19:07,539
All right, Shannon.

383
00:19:07,539 --> 00:19:08,759
All right.

384
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:11,759
Can you please stay for the bill?

385
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:19,650
Thank you, Mr. Trax.

386
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:23,509
I've never been humiliated like this before.

387
00:19:23,509 --> 00:19:25,509
Everyone is laughing at me.

388
00:19:25,509 --> 00:19:29,980
I'll make a big double for this.

389
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,980
Is Shannon paying for Ricky's party?

390
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,980
Can he not afford it?

391
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,980
Of course he can afford it.

392
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:41,039
He gave his credit card to his maid this morning for food, and look where she went.

393
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,039
The most expensive restaurant.

394
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,039
She is so shameless.

395
00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:53,579
Anytime.

396
00:19:53,579 --> 00:19:59,900
Well, I was supposed to treat you to dinner, but this whole scene with Mateo, I mean...

397
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,900
Johnny, I just hope you had a good night.

398
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,900
You've spent enough money on that asshole already.

399
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:05,960
Okay?

400
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:09,250
I'll make sure that Mateo refunds all of it straight back.

401
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:13,859
Johnny, do you own the hotel?

402
00:20:13,859 --> 00:20:14,859
Yes.

403
00:20:14,859 --> 00:20:21,299
There is no need to repay me, and there's no need to spend money on Ricky...

404
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:22,299
...of this food.

405
00:20:22,299 --> 00:20:25,289
It's to die for.

406
00:20:25,289 --> 00:20:26,289
Thank you.

407
00:20:26,289 --> 00:20:27,289
Thank you.

408
00:20:27,289 --> 00:20:28,289
I'm very proud of our menu.

409
00:20:28,289 --> 00:20:30,289
I think Luigi has done a wonderful job in the kitchen.

410
00:20:30,289 --> 00:20:33,289
And actually, I want you to feel comfortable here.

411
00:20:33,289 --> 00:20:36,289
Shannon, I want you to feel free to come whenever you like.

412
00:20:36,289 --> 00:20:40,289
Are you suggesting that I eat for free?

413
00:20:40,289 --> 00:20:44,509
Well, do you pay for your food at your own home?

414
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:46,509
No.

415
00:20:46,509 --> 00:20:51,509
In my past life, my father tried to arrange a marriage between Johnny and me,

416
00:20:51,509 --> 00:20:54,509
but I resisted and refused to get to know him.

417
00:20:54,509 --> 00:20:56,509
What a terrible mistake.

418
00:20:56,509 --> 00:20:57,509
He's wonderful.

419
00:20:57,509 --> 00:20:58,509
It's late.

420
00:20:58,509 --> 00:21:01,759
Can you drive me home?

421
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:36,779
Yes.

422
00:21:36,779 --> 00:21:38,779
Well, finally you're home.

423
00:21:38,779 --> 00:21:40,779
I bought Ricky to apologize to you.

424
00:21:40,779 --> 00:21:53,200
Mr. Trax, your son didn't offend me, so he doesn't have to apologize.

425
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,200
But you fired him?

426
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,200
Yeah, I did.

427
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,200
But I also fired you.

428
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,200
One was a tutor who made my grades worse.

429
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,200
And the other was a driver who left me on the side of the road.

430
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:10,200
But so funny is they still had the nerve to live on my property.

431
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:14,519
Miss Clark, Shannon, it was my fault.

432
00:22:14,519 --> 00:22:16,519
I need this job.

433
00:22:16,519 --> 00:22:18,519
Your father was my classmate.

434
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:20,519
Get let in down.

435
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:24,519
Well, you should have thought about that before leaving me on the side of the road.

436
00:22:24,519 --> 00:22:26,519
I'll talk to Ricky.

437
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:31,059
I'll make sure he's the best teacher you've ever, ever had.

438
00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:35,059
Mr. Trax, he's talking about your son, but he's just sitting there.

439
00:22:35,059 --> 00:22:38,059
Not apologizing and moping.

440
00:22:38,059 --> 00:22:49,900
Do you really want me to find your soul?

441
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,900
I owe a lot of money.

442
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,900
I need this job to pay it off.

443
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,900
Or comes out of you to wish it.

444
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,059
Get on her good side.

445
00:22:59,059 --> 00:23:01,059
The entire family fortune could be yours.

446
00:23:01,059 --> 00:23:06,089
Hours in the future.

447
00:23:06,089 --> 00:23:08,089
Have you heard me clearly?

448
00:23:08,089 --> 00:23:11,089
Get your shit together and apologize.

449
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:15,500
You know, I'm getting tired.

450
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:18,579
I should probably get a bed.

451
00:23:18,579 --> 00:23:20,579
I told you.

452
00:23:20,579 --> 00:23:22,579
Apologized to Miss Clark.

453
00:23:22,579 --> 00:23:26,980
Now!

454
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:37,410
Shannon, you have gone way too far this time.

455
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:46,759
Ricky Trax, in my past life, I not only supported you, but your gambling addict of a father as well.

456
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:50,759
Let's see how you pay off his debt without the protection of the Clark family.

457
00:23:50,759 --> 00:24:01,359
Shannon, did you really pay for Ricky's birthday party?

458
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:04,359
Because we thought he was the rich one.

459
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:09,359
So this means, look, if you want to know more, just ask your master himself.

460
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:12,650
Sure, he'll tell you everything.

461
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:14,650
We just find it really strange.

462
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:18,650
If you spend so much money on him, why isn't he with you?

463
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:20,650
Why is he with Karen?

464
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:25,650
Because, it doesn't matter how much of my own money she decides to go back at me.

465
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:33,650
It'll never change her poor grades, her two timing heart, and her soul full of lies.

466
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:39,650
And there is not a single thing that you can pay your calls close.

467
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:42,480
That's right.

468
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,480
She's at the bottom of the class because of her grades.

469
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:50,480
She throws money at Ricky to impress him, but then goes out with someone else.

470
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,539
Even if you're rich, she's a bad person.

471
00:24:53,539 --> 00:24:57,539
Exactly! Bad brain, bad heart.

472
00:24:57,539 --> 00:24:59,539
And I wonder why Ricky doesn't like her?

473
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:01,539
Yes, this party.

474
00:25:01,539 --> 00:25:06,539
She insisted on throwing this event and followed my credit card.

475
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:11,539
She's doing all this to humiliate, embarrass all of you.

476
00:25:11,539 --> 00:25:19,539
And before you can even say that it's your money, it's the money that's owed to me for trying to fix your brain.

477
00:25:19,539 --> 00:25:21,539
Your money doesn't mean shit.

478
00:25:21,539 --> 00:25:25,720
What are you laughing at?

479
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:33,079
I think you are the worst tutor in the entire world.

480
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:36,079
You know, it's incredible that you do great in class.

481
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:38,079
Because I am great. My grades are great.

482
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:40,079
It's your fault that yours isn't.

483
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:42,079
Is it because I'm dumb?

484
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:44,079
Or is it because of the way you teach?

485
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:46,079
Whatever.

486
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:50,079
Didn't you get a new tutor? How's that been working out for you?

487
00:25:50,079 --> 00:25:53,079
Actually, we have another test coming up.

488
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:55,109
Let's see how that works out.

489
00:25:55,109 --> 00:25:56,109
You want a bed?

490
00:25:56,109 --> 00:26:06,619
Sure. If you move up 100 spots on the rig, which I'm asking a lot, I won't admit that I was wrong.

491
00:26:06,619 --> 00:26:07,819
Deal!

492
00:26:07,819 --> 00:26:16,039
Cool. Actually, I'm so confident in this bet that if I do wind up losing, I'll even run 10 miles on the track.

493
00:26:16,039 --> 00:26:19,200
Ricky, what does that even have to do with me?

494
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:28,059
If I win, I want you to kneel down and poke you until I forgive you.

495
00:26:28,059 --> 00:26:31,019
Are you insane?

496
00:26:31,019 --> 00:26:34,019
You think it's okay to even ask that of Ricky?

497
00:26:34,019 --> 00:26:36,019
Sure. He'll do it.

498
00:26:36,019 --> 00:26:40,019
As long as you promise to do the same exact thing.

499
00:26:40,019 --> 00:26:47,019
But you have to bend like a puppy every day for a week.

500
00:26:47,019 --> 00:26:52,019
Unless you scared and wanna bow out.

501
00:26:52,019 --> 00:26:57,470
Insane!

502
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:59,660
She actually agreed?

503
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,660
She's completely out of her mind.

504
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:08,940
I'm insane!

505
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:11,680
I haven't seen you as far away in here!

506
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,680
I missed you so I came back.

507
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:16,569
Love you all.

508
00:27:16,569 --> 00:27:19,569
Oh my god.

509
00:27:19,569 --> 00:27:21,569
Is this Shannon's new target?

510
00:27:21,569 --> 00:27:25,619
Ricky, is this the guy you said she's been hanging out with?

511
00:27:25,619 --> 00:27:27,619
Yeah, that's him.

512
00:27:27,619 --> 00:27:29,619
She's been going for him for a while now.

513
00:27:29,619 --> 00:27:33,579
She wants him.

514
00:27:33,579 --> 00:27:36,579
Why is she all over a guy in his 50s?

515
00:27:36,579 --> 00:27:39,670
I knew she wasn't rich.

516
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:42,670
She got herself a sugar daddy.

517
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:46,859
I wonder why Ricky hates her.

518
00:27:46,859 --> 00:27:48,859
She's disgusting.

519
00:27:48,859 --> 00:27:50,859
Shannon, I know it's your father.

520
00:27:50,859 --> 00:27:53,859
But if you think I'll tell anyone, not Shannon.

521
00:27:53,859 --> 00:27:55,859
Enjoy your sugar daddy.

522
00:27:55,859 --> 00:27:59,859
Ricky, do you think she's getting all of her money from that old heart?

523
00:27:59,859 --> 00:28:01,859
You think she's that lucky?

524
00:28:01,859 --> 00:28:04,859
She's relying on someone, whether it's you or her sugar daddy.

525
00:28:04,859 --> 00:28:08,859
Shannon, this is only the beginning.

526
00:28:08,859 --> 00:28:09,859
What's going on?

527
00:28:09,859 --> 00:28:11,859
You're not usually this happy to see me.

528
00:28:11,859 --> 00:28:12,859
What happened?

529
00:28:12,859 --> 00:28:14,079
Nothing.

530
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:17,079
I just, I feel like I haven't seen you in a lifetime.

531
00:28:17,079 --> 00:28:19,079
I just really missed you.

532
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:24,079
In my past life, Dad was killed in an accident on a business trip.

533
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:27,079
The whole Clark Corporation was thrown into chaos.

534
00:28:27,079 --> 00:28:34,079
Somehow, because I was a fool, Ricky Trax and his good-for-nothing father took the company from me.

535
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:41,779
In this life, I'm not only going to protect Clark Corporation, but I'm going to protect my father as well.

536
00:28:41,779 --> 00:28:42,779
Shannon, love.

537
00:28:42,779 --> 00:28:45,779
Is that Ricky Trax still causing you trouble?

538
00:28:45,779 --> 00:28:48,779
Please, listen to me. He's bad news.

539
00:28:48,779 --> 00:28:51,779
Don't spend your time there. He's not worth your time or attention.

540
00:28:51,779 --> 00:28:55,779
I'd like to introduce you to a friend's son, Johnny Wonder.

541
00:28:55,779 --> 00:28:58,779
Listen, I know, I know. It's a ridiculous name.

542
00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:01,779
But he is a terrific young man.

543
00:29:01,779 --> 00:29:04,779
From a wealthy family that's well respected.

544
00:29:04,779 --> 00:29:06,779
Would you give him a chance for me?

545
00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:08,779
For you, anything.

546
00:29:08,779 --> 00:29:11,779
Did help just freeze over?

547
00:29:11,779 --> 00:29:15,809
Whenever I criticize Ricky, she loses her mind.

548
00:29:15,809 --> 00:29:18,809
Shannon, love. Are you sure everything's okay?

549
00:29:18,809 --> 00:29:24,740
Well, I did fire Ricky Trax and his father.

550
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:30,440
But if I do see Johnny Wonder, will you promise me one thing?

551
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:34,240
No more business trips. You will stay home.

552
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:39,240
Very well. I promise. In fact, tonight, I'm seeing the Wonder family.

553
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,269
Would you like to join me?

554
00:29:41,269 --> 00:29:46,269
Well, I would, but I'm going to see my new tutor, Johnny Wonder.

555
00:29:47,269 --> 00:29:51,269
So, well, please, young lady. The chip off field block.

556
00:29:51,269 --> 00:29:53,269
I'm the armabella. Go on.

557
00:29:53,269 --> 00:29:58,640
Hey, uh, I got to tell you something.

558
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,640
Yeah.

559
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:05,640
I made a bet with Ricky that if I don't move up a hundred places on the next exam,

560
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,670
I have to kneel down and beg.

561
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:10,670
A hundred places? What if you win?

562
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:15,670
Oh, well, if I win, he has to run 10 miles, bow down and beg.
