1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
Look, I guess I'll help you win, then.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,359
Wait, really?

3
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:07,519
Yeah, I mean, look, you're working hard, you're clearly improving, so...

4
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:09,039
Well, I know.

5
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:12,800
I know I'm doing a little better, but a hundred places?

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,910
I know, but we've got the time.

7
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:19,070
Plus, as far as I can see, I mean, Ricky Trax was a terrible tutor.

8
00:00:20,109 --> 00:00:23,390
Look, I'm pretty sure that he was the reason that you're so far behind.

9
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:25,649
You knew it.

10
00:00:25,649 --> 00:00:26,929
What a freaking able!

11
00:00:27,089 --> 00:00:27,649
Oh!

12
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:31,899
Mr. Wonder, my grades are near your hands.

13
00:00:32,859 --> 00:00:33,340
Here.

14
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:45,460
Attention class, the monthly exams have come back and, as expected,

15
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:49,859
the top of the class are Ricky and Cameron.

16
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:52,259
I guess Shannon will be running all afternoon.

17
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:59,060
But I would like to draw attention to someone else.

18
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:02,530
Ms. Shannon Clark.

19
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:09,569
Professor, did Shannon go from dead last to second to last?
