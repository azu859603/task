00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
Yesi, I expect you to be respectful and shut your mouth.

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,919
Shannon has moved up 253 places. That is amazing.

3
00:00:10,849 --> 00:00:15,570
What? 200 places? A professor found us in a mistake because

4
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,210
your grades are so poor, there's no way she could...

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,460
I made no mistake. Shannon, you have done a great job. Keep up the good work.

6
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:25,339
Thanks professor.

7
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:30,190
Oh, where it was?

8
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:32,990
Did you forget about a little bloke?

9
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:34,829
You got lucky this time.

10
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:37,060
So what?

11
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,100
Locker no luck. You lost the bet.

12
00:00:40,659 --> 00:00:43,299
So you better start running and then kneel down and beg.

13
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:46,619
Unless you want to beg now.

14
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:52,990
Shannon, I'm acting all high in writing. Moving up to magic places is not that impressive.

15
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:55,869
Ricky is right first and Karen is second.

16
00:00:55,869 --> 00:00:58,909
You don't see them acting all high in writing.

17
00:00:58,909 --> 00:01:00,990
Girl, why are you even yapping?

18
00:01:01,789 --> 00:01:04,750
Ricky placed a bet that I couldn't move up 100 places.

19
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:10,510
And guess what? I moved up 200. So it's time to pay up Ricky Trucks.

20
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:15,790
Karen's a lap dog and you're the ring of Nancy's heart.
