1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,740
Shannon, stand up.

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:04,740
Does something wrong, Professor?

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:08,740
Someone has reported that you have cheated on this exam.

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:11,439
Is this true?

5
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:13,439
Does this person have any evidence?

6
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:17,440
Well, the grades have taken a tremendous leap,

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,440
so it's understandable that some students are very suspicious.

8
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:25,440
Let them suspect. I don't care. I didn't cheat.

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:29,440
Okay, well, for your reputation and for being fair,

10
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:33,439
I'm excited that you can take the test again. Do you want to do it?

11
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:35,439
No, of course not.

12
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:40,210
If she didn't cheat, what would she be so afraid of?

13
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:44,240
If someone makes an accusation, they should have proof.

14
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,240
Otherwise, it's slander.

15
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,240
Let's say they accuse me tomorrow, and then the day after that,

16
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:54,240
how many times do I have to redo work in order for them to shut up?

17
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,240
I might as well drop out since I'm performing for them.

18
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,460
Why did she get so smart?
