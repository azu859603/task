1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,940
You're being unreasonable.

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:08,580
The teacher told you to retake the exam, so stop arguing.

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,019
This retake is a chance to clear your name.

4
00:00:12,019 --> 00:00:15,980
You don't want people doubting you behind your back, do you again?

5
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:21,260
Professor, I'm sorry. The reasoning behind this is absolutely absurd, but...

6
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:24,260
For you, I will retake the exam.

7
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:28,260
Shannon, it's no big deal. There's no need to feel guilty.

8
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,260
Who doesn't feel guilty?

9
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:32,289
Still making excuses.

10
00:00:32,289 --> 00:00:34,289
Stunning zombies.

11
00:00:34,289 --> 00:00:36,289
You have to shut up.

12
00:00:36,289 --> 00:00:41,289
You're always trying to find something to bitch about because you're so boring for Karen's approval.

13
00:00:41,289 --> 00:00:47,320
Professor, since she accused me without any evidence, should there be consequences?

14
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,990
What did you say?

15
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:56,990
Professor, Yancy has accused me of cheating without any proof and that has targeted me repeatedly for weeks.

16
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:04,540
If I retake the exam and prove that I didn't cheat, I think she should drop out.

17
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:08,760
You want her to drop out? Seriously? How could she be like this?
