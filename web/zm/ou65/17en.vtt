00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.080
You want her to drop out?

2
00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.080
Professor, she made a stupid rumor about me cheating.

3
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:13.080
Even if I prove my innocence, I will always be known as the girl who was accused of cheating.

4
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.079
Wouldn't that ruin my reputation?

5
00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:22.210
What if I can't handle the pressure and I do something drastic, like, kill myself?

6
00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.210
Suicide? What should we do then?

7
00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.210
Maybe she's letting go.

8
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.210
Alright, we get it.

9
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.210
Yeah, see, didn't she insist I cheated?

10
00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.210
Or are you scared of your own words?

11
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.369
I'm not afraid.

12
00:00:38.369 --> 00:00:43.460
Fine, but if I'm right, then you have to drop out because I'm not going to be the same.

13
00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.590
Do.

14
00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.630
Professor, can I take the exam?

15
00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.630
And can you make sure Ricky keeps his word as well?

16
00:00:53.630 --> 00:01:03.530
Do you really want to do this right now?

17
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.849
I mean, when they do catch you, they will kick you out of school.

18
00:01:07.849 --> 00:01:10.849
Just confess, I'll help get you a case of a boy.

19
00:01:10.849 --> 00:01:12.299
Okay?

20
00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.299
Maybe better, a little bit.

21
00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:15.299
I won't make you run.

22
00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.299
Thanks, Ricky.

23
00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:19.299
But you will have to know now that I'm ready for getting this.

24
00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:22.900
Whatever.

25
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.900
When I pass this test, it'll be your dignity on the line.

26
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:31.900
So you better start warming up those calves, not just for running, but for kneeling as well.

27
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:32.900
Thank you.
