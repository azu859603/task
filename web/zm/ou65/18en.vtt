00:00:06.219 --> 00:00:22.539
Professor, are you stalling because you know she cheated?

2
00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:23.820
Because I know she did.

3
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.460
Professor, if she did so poorly, why don't we just let this end and cancel the bet?

4
00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.299
I think Yancea wouldn't force her to drop out if Shannon just...

5
00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:38.259
Oh, just... Karen, you're so kind, but don't you remember she brutally insulted you?

6
00:00:38.259 --> 00:00:40.579
She deserves to be kicked out of school.

7
00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:41.659
She's right, Karen.

8
00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:46.859
She should run 10 miles and then kneel before she's got to learn somehow.

9
00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:50.700
Karen, I think you should just apologize to Ricky and Yancea.

10
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.500
We can just forget that any of this happened, okay?

11
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.859
Why are you guys even talking?

12
00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:58.140
I mean, if has the professor said anything?

13
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.740
Do you know what was on my test?

14
00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.979
Please give him a chance before you start talking shit.

15
00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:05.379
Attention, class.

16
00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:10.900
I would all like you to know that Shannon's test was much more difficult than all of yours.

17
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.900
Professor, stop defending her.

18
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.420
If she failed, she failed.

19
00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:15.420
Exactly.

20
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.980
If she wasn't a cheater, she would have done just fine on both tests.
