00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.070
Shannon, I'm giving you one last chance to come clean.

2
00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:06.290
Karen, this is your final warning.

3
00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.830
Back up or don't complain when your face hurts more than Nancy's.

4
00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:15.029
As I've said before, this test is much harder than the previous exam,

5
00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:20.210
and I'm happy to say that Shannon scored higher than before.

6
00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.230
So it is clear that she did not cheat.

7
00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.000
Who is this possible? How could you not have cheated?

8
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Professor, you must have miscalculated the scores.

9
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.219
Give it up!

10
00:00:30.219 --> 00:00:36.219
Shannon, you have made incredible progress, and I am very impressed.

11
00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:39.579
What have you done to continue this progress?

12
00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:41.700
It's quite simple, Professor.

13
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.020
I had a bat tutor, and only have a good one.

14
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.119
It feels really good doing well.

15
00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:53.439
Well, this incident right here proves how toxic this classroom environment is,

16
00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:58.640
and I will do everything in my tower to make sure that Shannon's name is clear,

17
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:06.120
and that anybody that falsely accused Shannon of cheating shall be punished as well.

18
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:13.480
Nancy, you said if I don't cheat, you will drop out.

19
00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.219
So are you gonna stick to your word?
