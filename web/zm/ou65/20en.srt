1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,229
If you don't drop out, I'll sue you

2
00:00:03,229 --> 00:00:06,549
for spreading rumors and false accusations.

3
00:00:06,549 --> 00:00:08,130
And if that's not enough,

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:12,369
our teacher knows that you're a dishonest, untrustworthy liar.

5
00:00:12,369 --> 00:00:15,820
I can only imagine the letter of recommendation

6
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:16,879
he'll write about you.

7
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:18,620
Shannon, we're all friends.

8
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:22,460
She was just worried about you going down the wrong path.

9
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:25,500
Morally, she was trying to wake you up.

10
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,820
Don't ruin her future.

11
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,820
Right, isn't forcing her to drop out too much?

12
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,979
No, Karen, if you care about Yancey so much,

13
00:00:33,979 --> 00:00:35,700
you can drop out in your place.

14
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,700
I mean, Ricky would take care of you.

15
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,420
Shane, you care about this.

16
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:42,100
Yeah, Karen defended you.

17
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,100
She treats everyone equally.

18
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,020
Treats everyone equally.

19
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,380
Why does she want you to know me to drop out, huh?

20
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:50,140
Of course.

21
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,619
I would defend you, Yancey.

22
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:56,539
Dropping out is a little too much.

23
00:00:56,539 --> 00:00:57,619
Shut up.

24
00:00:57,619 --> 00:00:59,219
You are always acting like a saint,

25
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:01,060
but I never forgot.

26
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,939
So you deserve what's coming to you.

27
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:04,900
As for you, Yancey.

28
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,980
If you really, really don't want to drop out,

29
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:10,099
I guess we can make an arrangement.

30
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:12,780
Please.
