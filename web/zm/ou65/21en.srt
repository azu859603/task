1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,720
Please, whatever it takes.

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:10,349
Oh, since you're someone who spread false accusations and doesn't want to drop out,

3
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:14,310
you can run 20 miles around the track.

4
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:19,769
But now you're running, I want you to chant, I'm falsely a cute Shannon.

5
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:23,230
Shannon didn't cheat, okay.

6
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:29,719
She passed one exam, there is no need to be this fight.

7
00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:32,560
Vicki tracks things it's time to lecture me.

8
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:36,320
Why don't you kneel down and beg until I forgive you?

9
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,810
Fuck.

10
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:42,429
Vicki!

11
00:00:42,429 --> 00:00:43,429
Vicki!

12
00:00:43,429 --> 00:00:44,560
Yeah!

13
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,960
It said you'd kneel, I'm just helping.

14
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,359
Now beg.

15
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:51,960
Shannon, perhaps you shouldn't ruin friendship over a text.

16
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,159
Oh, Professor, these people aren't my friends.

17
00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:59,159
If they don't keep their word, I'll never let it go and I'll drive them out of school.

18
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:00,380
Oh no!

19
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:02,380
It's 10 miles.

20
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:06,819
I'll run 10 also, 20.
