00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:06.830
Jennin, are you trying to kill her? She can't run 20 miles!

2
00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.890
Oh, please, she made the bed. She should honor it.

3
00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:15.949
Unless you want to run in her place.

4
00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:20.859
How about this?

5
00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:23.859
You don't have to run the 20, and you both run 10.

6
00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:28.859
Since you're so willing to help anyone in me.

7
00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.859
Hey, actually, I have asthma, so I care.

8
00:00:33.859 --> 00:00:36.409
Well, you don't see me. That's right.

9
00:00:36.409 --> 00:00:38.409
But it looks like Karen's unwilling.

10
00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:55.500
What are you doing? Run!

11
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.500
Come on!

12
00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:49.159
You're awake. Thank God.

13
00:01:49.159 --> 00:02:03.260
You need to get over yourself.

14
00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.260
You had a whole team of specialists check every nook,

15
00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.259
brandy, and inch of your body, and they said they were free.

16
00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.699
Anything the doctor just said you need to work out a little more.

17
00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:20.520
Looks like you can finish those 12 miles a series possible.

18
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.060
No, I can't. I cannot keep running.

19
00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.060
If I keep running, I'm going to die.
