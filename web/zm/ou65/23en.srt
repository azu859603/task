1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,060
Oh, we're not gonna die, dummy.

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,370
You don't have the whole hospital backing you up.

3
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:11,599
I mean, if you can't run one more mile,

4
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:20,140
you can always drop out.

5
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:22,519
Why are you so mean?

6
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,120
Me?

7
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,280
Do you even know what you said to me today?

8
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,280
The things you did?

9
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:36,590
Nancy, it's either you run or you drop out, okay?

10
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:41,570
I'll run.

11
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:50,750
Good luck.

12
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,590
Karen, it's changed so much.

13
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:56,509
I can't keep doing this.

14
00:00:56,509 --> 00:00:58,869
Nancy, don't worry.

15
00:00:58,869 --> 00:01:01,429
She's just being unreasonable.

16
00:01:01,429 --> 00:01:04,709
I mean, can you imagine how disgusting

17
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:08,590
she must feel having to please her sugar daddy all the time?

18
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:13,319
I mean, can't even imagine.

19
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:18,989
Robin, if everyone found out, you know,

20
00:01:20,019 --> 00:01:24,730
that would set her on the right path.

21
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:27,049
You're too kind, Karen.

22
00:01:27,049 --> 00:01:28,450
She's so cruel to you,

23
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:32,569
and you just want her to be a better person.

24
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,420
She's a disgrace to our school

25
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:40,459
and deserves her body to help!

26
00:01:40,459 --> 00:01:44,180
I had pictures of her with a disgusting old man.

27
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,420
You could post them only.

28
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,420
Oh, no, Nancy, that's that's too punch.

29
00:01:52,019 --> 00:01:55,379
What would the principal do if long doubt,

30
00:01:55,379 --> 00:02:01,700
especially with the outstanding student awards coming up?

31
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,260
I could do it at the ceremony.
