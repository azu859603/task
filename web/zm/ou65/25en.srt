1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,139
You're here. Did you come to cheer for Rudy?

2
00:00:04,139 --> 00:00:08,140
No, I have zero interest in cheering for him.

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:12,140
I'm not sure their joke on a tennis ball didn't cheer for you.

4
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:15,140
Shannon, you are such a horrible liar.

5
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,140
You come cheer for me all the time.

6
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:23,460
Oh, well, I hate to break it to you, but I'm not here for you. I'm over it.

7
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:29,460
Look, just because you got your grades up and all that, doesn't mean you're special.

8
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,460
And that doesn't mean that you're better than me and Karen either.

9
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,490
Oh, I'm sorry. Were you talking?

10
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:36,490
I wasn't listening.

11
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:40,490
Shannon, enough. We were just trying to be polite.

12
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:42,490
You know, we were all friends once.

13
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:44,490
Oh, thank God I have standards.

14
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:48,490
I don't listen. Nobody wants to be friends with her anyone.

15
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:52,490
Shannon, you're getting too full of yourself.

16
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:56,490
What's it because she has a rich sugar daddy to support her?

17
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:02,299
Oh, what? What did you say?

18
00:01:02,299 --> 00:01:04,299
Ladies, ladies, ladies.

19
00:01:04,299 --> 00:01:06,299
Uh, and Shannon.

20
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:08,299
Um, it's time for me to shine.

21
00:01:08,299 --> 00:01:10,299
Who are you playing?

22
00:01:10,299 --> 00:01:13,299
Some boy, some rundown score.

23
00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:15,299
He hasn't got shit on me though.

24
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:20,000
Oh, Ricky, you're amazing.

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Shannon, so who do you think will win today?

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,230
Oh, my God.

27
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:31,230
Is that this guy that's playing against Ricky?
