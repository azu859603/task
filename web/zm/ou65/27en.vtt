1
00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:07.700
Reeky dress! Reeky dress! Reeky dress!

2
00:00:07.700 --> 00:01:02.799
Reeky lost so badly. I feel he and Johnny were on the same level, but that was you leaving.

3
00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:05.799
We're getting as a side character compared to Johnny.

4
00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:09.299
Even Sean has moved on. Remember how say she was with Reeky?

5
00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.299
Absolutely shameless.

6
00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:13.799
Well, good thing Johnny won't show him the time of day.

7
00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.299
You sure about that? Help clean me.

8
00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:18.299
She has a sugar daddy.

9
00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.299
It's revolting to even think about.

10
00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.700
What did you just say, Nancy?

11
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.870
Can you give me a bottle of water, please?

12
00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:33.870
No, but what a good job!

13
00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.560
Thank you.

14
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.879
Yeah.

15
00:01:37.879 --> 00:01:39.879
I think I twisted my wrist early.

16
00:01:39.879 --> 00:01:53.629
Do you mind holding water for me?

17
00:01:53.629 --> 00:01:55.629
Do you mind holding the bottle for me?

18
00:01:55.629 --> 00:01:58.099
Okay.

19
00:01:58.099 --> 00:02:03.359
Yeah, of course.

20
00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:07.359
I am going to get some thanks for your rest.

21
00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:14.680
Please, thank you.

22
00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.960
So, you must be Johnny.

23
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:27.199
I hope you're not thinking of dating Shannon. She already has a sugar daddy.

24
00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:30.460
Shut up. Why are you being so pathetic?

25
00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.460
Don't be mad, I guess.

26
00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.460
She's just concerned that you're being deceived.

27
00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.460
We're all friends with Shannon and we're worried.

28
00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.460
She's going down the wrong path.

29
00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.460
She won't listen to us and maybe she can listen to you.

30
00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.460
So, you think that being friends is what?

31
00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.460
Spreading rumors about it.

32
00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.460
I don't know about you, but I think that makes you a pretty bad friend.

33
00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:54.460
No, no, no.

34
00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:55.460
It's not like that.

35
00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.460
We're genuinely concerned about Shannon and since she's chasing after you,

36
00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.460
we figured she might listen to you.

37
00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:11.419
What?

38
00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:13.419
She's pursuing me.

39
00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:16.419
Isn't it obvious she acted like this with Brittany?

40
00:03:16.419 --> 00:03:19.000
Right, okay.

41
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.889
Thanks for telling me, I guess, but you're wrong about one thing.

42
00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:26.680
I'm pursuing her.

43
00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:32.449
What?

44
00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:33.449
I understand.

45
00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:35.449
Why does he like Shannon?

46
00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:36.449
She has a...

47
00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:39.740
She has a sugar daddy.

48
00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:40.740
Fine.

49
00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.740
If you want second hand goods, then by all means...

50
00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:44.740
Pursue her.

51
00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:48.210
Pardon me.

52
00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:49.210
I did.

53
00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:51.280
Now say that again.

54
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.009
It's right.

55
00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:55.009
No apologies.

56
00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:59.590
Are you itching for another 20 mile run, Nancy?

57
00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.590
You know, she's not completely wrong.

58
00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.590
Me and everyone saw you passing me before.

59
00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.590
Ricky, I was so blind before, but you mean nothing to me.

60
00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.680
Do you really want to be with Johnny?

61
00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.290
I'm obsessed with you.

62
00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.290
What does it matter if I'm with Johnny or not?

63
00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.439
Shannon, I'll give you a second chance.

64
00:04:23.439 --> 00:04:27.360
You be my girlfriend.

65
00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.360
What makes you think you're so important?

66
00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:31.939
You're with Karen.

67
00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:35.939
I mean, do you not care how she feels when you say these things to me?

68
00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:41.230
Shannon, I will ruin you in front of the principal and the board members.

69
00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:52.959
You have completely crossed the line this time.

70
00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:54.959
I will never forgive you for this.

71
00:04:54.959 --> 00:04:59.959
I don't care about your forgiveness, you piece of shit.

72
00:04:59.959 --> 00:05:12.399
And so what now?

73
00:05:12.399 --> 00:05:13.399
This is all yours.

74
00:05:13.399 --> 00:05:16.870
First smart movie, wait all day.

75
00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:22.680
Hey, the wrist.

76
00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.680
Yeah, it's all right.

77
00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.680
I'm glad we have to punch that chair.

78
00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.990
Yes.

79
00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.490
Hey, what's your own?

80
00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:36.490
Oh, it was just that thing you saw earlier.

81
00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.610
Which thing?

82
00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:43.610
It was about you wanting to chase me.

83
00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:49.709
Well, I mean, technically the word I use was pursued.

84
00:05:49.709 --> 00:05:55.439
Well, do you want to know if I want to be pursued?

85
00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:56.439
Obviously.

86
00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:59.399
All right, Mr. Wonder.

87
00:05:59.399 --> 00:06:00.399
I'm hungry.

88
00:06:00.399 --> 00:06:04.399
So, I'm going to go to the cafeteria to get something you want to come with.

89
00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.720
Technically, that wasn't an answer.

90
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.959
Karen.

91
00:06:10.959 --> 00:06:13.019
Karen!

92
00:06:13.019 --> 00:06:14.339
Hey, Karen.

93
00:06:14.339 --> 00:06:19.009
Hey, don't be upset with me.

94
00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:24.300
Why does Shannon get to be chased by Johnny while I'm stuck with this nobody?

95
00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:25.680
Hey.

96
00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:29.290
Harry and I said those things shouldn't calm her down.

97
00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:30.290
Right?

98
00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:32.290
I'm not giving her a second chance.

99
00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:33.319
I know.

100
00:06:33.319 --> 00:06:35.449
I was just feeling down.

101
00:06:35.449 --> 00:06:36.959
Come on.

102
00:06:36.959 --> 00:06:39.800
Let's get out of here.

103
00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:40.920
Get food or something.

104
00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:42.920
You can get whatever you want.

105
00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:44.920
So, a steak dinner?

106
00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.980
Whatever you want.

107
00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:48.079
Okay.

108
00:06:48.079 --> 00:06:52.250
I'm not holding back then.

109
00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:56.110
Sit it at my pouch.

110
00:06:56.110 --> 00:07:03.199
You know, they're long gone.

111
00:07:03.199 --> 00:07:06.199
You're still holding off the dear love.

112
00:07:06.199 --> 00:07:07.199
What?

113
00:07:07.199 --> 00:07:11.639
You don't want me holding your arm.

114
00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:13.639
I thought you were pursuing me.

115
00:07:13.639 --> 00:07:14.639
I am.

116
00:07:14.639 --> 00:07:16.959
I am pursuing you.

117
00:07:16.959 --> 00:07:19.790
You don't believe me?

118
00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:21.399
Hey.

119
00:07:21.399 --> 00:07:23.399
I never said I don't believe you.

120
00:07:23.399 --> 00:07:27.649
And do I have permission to pursue him?

121
00:07:27.649 --> 00:07:30.649
Johnny, that's a little straightforward.

122
00:07:30.649 --> 00:07:31.649
I don't know what to say.

123
00:07:31.649 --> 00:07:32.649
Right.

124
00:07:32.649 --> 00:07:33.649
I guess I'll, um...

125
00:07:33.649 --> 00:07:34.649
I'll take that as a yes.

126
00:07:34.649 --> 00:07:36.100
Hey.

127
00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:41.100
At your school award, Sandy, this week, I'm going to be there.

128
00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:43.100
And now you have a special gift.

129
00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:46.100
He's not planning to confess to me on that day, is he?

130
00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:49.290
In front of the whole school, it's too high profile.

131
00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:51.290
Way too high profile.

132
00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:55.290
I'm in a tutor here so far that you make top three.

133
00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:57.290
And then you're going to have to give a speech.

134
00:07:57.290 --> 00:07:59.290
In front of all those jerks who are mean to you.

135
00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:04.290
And they're not in any choice, but to see just how brilliant.

136
00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:08.350
Does that sound like confidence for that?

137
00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:11.350
That was the gift you were going to give me?

138
00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:16.199
I have the confidence.

139
00:08:16.199 --> 00:08:20.430
Also, I think you should stay away from the tracks.

140
00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:24.560
And I've done a bit of investigating and none of them have been.

141
00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:26.319
I know.

142
00:08:26.319 --> 00:08:27.319
I know.

143
00:08:27.319 --> 00:08:32.389
In my previous life, that father and son scumbad duo were willing to be.

144
00:08:32.389 --> 00:08:35.580
In this life, I'm going to send them to hell.

145
00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:39.970
Hey.

146
00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:44.360
Didn't you say you were going to treat me to something to you?

147
00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:45.360
Yes.

148
00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:50.360
Today, whatever a super-teen or Johnny wants, it's all me.

149
00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:51.360
Thank you.

150
00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:52.360
Let's go.

151
00:08:52.360 --> 00:09:04.309
So shameless.

152
00:09:05.629 --> 00:09:14.309
Oh, hi.

153
00:09:14.309 --> 00:09:15.309
You're always running after her.

154
00:09:15.309 --> 00:09:18.000
Let's go.

155
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.000
You're hurting me.

156
00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:26.200
What is your relationship with Johnny Wonder?

157
00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:31.230
You two have been together this whole time.

158
00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:35.230
You two have been together this whole time.

159
00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:36.230
No.

160
00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:37.230
I wish.

161
00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:39.230
But Johnny Wonder is so pure.

162
00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:43.230
I'm afraid if I don't take things one step at a time, I'll scare him off.

163
00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:45.289
I don't believe you.

164
00:09:45.289 --> 00:09:49.289
You are lying to me.

165
00:09:49.289 --> 00:09:53.289
You two are little, little study sessions.

166
00:09:53.289 --> 00:09:56.289
What are you actually doing?

167
00:09:56.289 --> 00:09:59.360
He is not that kind of person.

168
00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:00.360
Fine.

169
00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:04.740
I admit, I was serious about caring before.

170
00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:05.740
But no.

171
00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:07.799
I'm serious about you.

172
00:10:07.799 --> 00:10:11.159
You're just upsensing me with Johnny.

173
00:10:11.159 --> 00:10:12.159
Thank you.

174
00:10:12.159 --> 00:10:15.799
Every time you look at me.

175
00:10:15.799 --> 00:10:18.889
You light up like a ball of joy.

176
00:10:18.889 --> 00:10:24.789
I never once have you ever looked at me like that.

177
00:10:24.789 --> 00:10:31.950
It hurts, doesn't it?

178
00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:35.679
I used to feel pain there too.

179
00:10:35.679 --> 00:10:36.809
Ricky, right?

180
00:10:36.809 --> 00:10:37.809
He's new.

181
00:10:37.809 --> 00:10:38.809
Everything.

182
00:10:38.809 --> 00:10:44.809
Just to get confused and murdered and I will never follow the despair and pain.

183
00:10:44.809 --> 00:10:54.090
Everything that I've done to you is just the beginning.

184
00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:58.090
And it's just going to get worse day by day.

185
00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:03.129
Murder?

186
00:11:03.129 --> 00:11:05.129
What are you talking about, Shannon?

187
00:11:05.129 --> 00:11:08.129
I've never abused you once.

188
00:11:08.129 --> 00:11:10.129
You look fine and well to me.

189
00:11:10.129 --> 00:11:16.289
Get off of me!

190
00:11:16.289 --> 00:11:18.289
Hey!

191
00:11:18.289 --> 00:11:19.289
Did you listen to her?

192
00:11:19.289 --> 00:11:22.509
Get off of her!

193
00:11:22.509 --> 00:11:24.509
Johnny Wonder?

194
00:11:24.509 --> 00:11:26.730
This is none of your business.

195
00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:28.730
I'm talking to Shannon right now.

196
00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:30.730
You know, Shannon said, get off of her.

197
00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:35.950
Were you going to do something about it?

198
00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:39.080
Were you going to hit me?

199
00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:46.809
Why don't we let shit fuck you hit me?

200
00:11:46.809 --> 00:11:48.809
Yeah, I hate you.

201
00:11:48.809 --> 00:11:53.350
He shouldn't get his hand started touching me.

202
00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:54.350
But you know what?

203
00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:58.350
I was going to use you as a toy and torture you until you went insane.

204
00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:01.799
Do not get near me and Johnny.

205
00:12:01.799 --> 00:12:02.799
Let's go.

206
00:12:02.799 --> 00:12:14.080
Shannon, you ruined my relationship with Ricky.

207
00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:16.080
I'm going to make you pay.

208
00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:20.080
In front of everyone, I'm going to expose you and your sugar daddy.

209
00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:23.879
I'm going to ruin you.

210
00:12:23.879 --> 00:12:26.879
Well, that was embarrassing.

211
00:12:26.879 --> 00:12:28.879
I'm sorry you had to see that again.

212
00:12:28.879 --> 00:12:29.879
No, Shannon.

213
00:12:29.879 --> 00:12:31.879
I'm sorry that I wasn't there to help you.

214
00:12:31.879 --> 00:12:32.879
If he had a hurt...

215
00:12:32.879 --> 00:12:36.389
No, I will not let him hurt me a second time.

216
00:12:36.389 --> 00:12:38.549
A second time?

217
00:12:38.549 --> 00:12:41.830
Shannon, he hurt you before?

218
00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:43.830
I'm so embarrassed that I haven't been there for you.

219
00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:46.830
I want you to know that from now on, I will always protect you.

220
00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:47.830
No.

221
00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:49.830
No, it's not your fault.

222
00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:54.110
It was my own foolishness.

223
00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:57.000
Thanks, Johnny.

224
00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
I just had a really bad dream.

225
00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.929
In another lifetime, Ricky killed me.

226
00:13:04.929 --> 00:13:06.929
But I woke up.

227
00:13:06.929 --> 00:13:10.830
And in that dream was I.

228
00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:16.919
Yeah, you were.

229
00:13:16.919 --> 00:13:18.919
You actually came at the end.

230
00:13:18.919 --> 00:13:19.919
And then?

231
00:13:19.919 --> 00:13:22.169
And then...

232
00:13:22.169 --> 00:13:25.169
Maybe I should just tell you that at the party.

233
00:13:26.169 --> 00:13:30.169
Oh, actually, I can't believe I almost forgot to congratulate him.

234
00:13:30.169 --> 00:13:33.169
Your school's outstanding student representative award.

235
00:13:33.169 --> 00:13:35.169
That is amazing, Shannon.

236
00:13:35.169 --> 00:13:37.679
You really deserve this.

237
00:13:37.679 --> 00:13:39.679
Well, I couldn't have done it without you.

238
00:13:39.679 --> 00:13:42.679
You're such a great tutor.

239
00:13:42.679 --> 00:13:46.679
Which, by the way, I got you a gift as well.

240
00:13:46.679 --> 00:13:51.679
Oh, I guess now I'm actually excited for the award ceremony.

241
00:13:51.679 --> 00:13:53.909
That's a good one.

242
00:13:53.909 --> 00:13:58.750
Professor,

243
00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:02.750
why is Shannon the outstanding student representative for this year's award ceremony?

244
00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:04.750
It should be me.

245
00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:07.750
It should have been you for years, but you insisted on giving it to Ricky.

246
00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:10.320
Well, he deserved it.

247
00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:12.320
You deserve it.

248
00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:15.389
But you insisted on giving it to that boy.

249
00:14:15.389 --> 00:14:19.389
Meanwhile, Shannon has been making great progress.

250
00:14:19.389 --> 00:14:24.389
And her progress is an inspiration to all the other students.

251
00:14:24.389 --> 00:14:27.120
How could they do this to me?

252
00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:28.120
It should be me.

253
00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:29.120
I'm sorry.

254
00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:34.120
You had the opportunity for the honors, but you kept turning it down.

255
00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:38.120
You could talk to the principal if you want, but it won't change anything.

256
00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:39.440
I'm sorry.

257
00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:41.659
I understand.

258
00:14:41.659 --> 00:14:43.950
Thank you for your time.

259
00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:48.639
Shannon stole Ricky from me.

260
00:14:48.639 --> 00:14:50.639
Now she's stealing my honor.

261
00:14:50.639 --> 00:14:52.639
What else is she going to take from me?

262
00:14:52.639 --> 00:15:04.370
That's Shannon and her sugar daddy.

263
00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:06.370
What?

264
00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:10.820
I'm going to expose you in front of everyone, Shannon.

265
00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:12.820
Don't go ready.

266
00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:14.820
Let me get to hear your speech.

267
00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:17.820
I'm also excited to hear your speech, Dad.

268
00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:19.820
You stupid member.

269
00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:21.820
No, I'm nervous.

270
00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:22.820
Second leg.

271
00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:25.240
I love you, sweetheart.

272
00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:33.990
Let's welcome today's student representative for the award ceremony, Shannon Clark.

273
00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:49.600
I'm Shannon Clark, today's student representative.

274
00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:53.600
And I am so grateful to be giving this speech.

275
00:15:54.600 --> 00:16:00.029
First, I have something I'd like to report.

276
00:16:00.029 --> 00:16:19.870
Come to my attention that Shannon Clark is not qualified to be this year's outstanding student representative,

277
00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:23.870
because she's selling herself to an older man.

278
00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:34.919
I'd like to expose Shannon before she can tarnish this school's reputation any more than she already has.

279
00:16:34.919 --> 00:16:41.919
She's selling herself, her grades are unnaturally improving, and she treats her fellow classmates

280
00:16:41.919 --> 00:16:43.919
with malice and with cruelty.

281
00:16:43.919 --> 00:16:44.919
No, no, no.

282
00:16:44.919 --> 00:16:45.919
She's lying.

283
00:16:45.919 --> 00:16:48.919
If you claim I'm being kept to your evidence.

284
00:16:48.919 --> 00:16:56.240
If you're going to slander me in front of the entire school without any proof, I'm going to sue you.

285
00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:59.850
Who says I don't have any proof?

286
00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:00.850
Everyone.

287
00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:02.850
Please look at the big screen behind me.

288
00:17:02.850 --> 00:17:13.720
The sugar daddy rumors are true.

289
00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:16.720
I'm sorry.

290
00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:19.720
I think these students have absolutely no idea what's going on.

291
00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:20.720
I'm really sorry.

292
00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:21.720
I'll just put it in this room.

293
00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:22.720
No need.

294
00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:23.720
No need.

295
00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:26.720
I want to see what these imbeciles think that they can accomplish.

296
00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:31.720
See, this is the evidence called Karen.

297
00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:34.720
This is the man you claim is keeping me?

298
00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:35.720
Yeah.

299
00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:39.359
Shannon, what do you have to say for yourself?

300
00:17:40.359 --> 00:17:43.250
Shannon, how are you doing?

301
00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:44.250
So old.

302
00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:50.329
How can you bring yourself to be with us?

303
00:17:50.329 --> 00:17:52.329
Oh, Karen.

304
00:17:52.329 --> 00:17:56.910
Who says that this man is old and ugly?

305
00:17:56.910 --> 00:18:02.910
If anything, I think he's the most handsome man in the entire world.

306
00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:04.910
Well, second most handsome.

307
00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:08.910
Hey, will I talk to second?

308
00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:12.910
Oh, Shannon, you really have no shame, huh?

309
00:18:12.910 --> 00:18:14.910
Being kept by this man?

310
00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:15.910
Fine.

311
00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:16.910
Take his money.

312
00:18:16.910 --> 00:18:20.390
But calling him handsome?

313
00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:23.390
She's in love with her sugar daddy.

314
00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:31.799
Shannon, you really have no shame.

315
00:18:31.799 --> 00:18:34.799
Could you at least try to act embarrassed?

316
00:18:34.799 --> 00:18:41.289
I'm shameless because I think this man is handsome.

317
00:18:41.289 --> 00:18:42.289
I was in love with you.

318
00:18:42.289 --> 00:18:46.289
You're a disgrace to every student here.

319
00:18:46.289 --> 00:18:49.289
You're a humiliation, Karen.

320
00:18:49.289 --> 00:18:52.289
If anyone is going to be humiliated today, it's going to be.

321
00:18:52.289 --> 00:18:56.289
Oh, since you admitted it, why don't you apologize to everyone?

322
00:18:56.289 --> 00:18:59.289
Drop out and maybe then you can salvage some dignity.

323
00:18:59.289 --> 00:19:01.289
Oh, you're too kind.

324
00:19:01.289 --> 00:19:03.289
That's how people walk all over you.

325
00:19:03.289 --> 00:19:10.210
In my opinion, she should be expelled from the school.

326
00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:15.440
Karen, I would like to know told you I have a sugar daddy.

327
00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:19.440
You have the photos, so someone must have tipped you off.

328
00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:21.720
Do you have any witnesses?

329
00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:22.720
Of course.

330
00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:24.720
I have a witness.

331
00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:30.200
Ricky Trax told us, and we all believe Ricky.

332
00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:32.720
Ricky, tell him what you told us.

333
00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:37.400
Isn't it true?

334
00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:39.400
Come on, Ricky.

335
00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:40.400
Say something.

336
00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:42.750
Is it true or not?

337
00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:43.750
No.

338
00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:45.750
Is this the witness?

339
00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:47.750
Come on, Ricky.

340
00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:52.230
Tell everyone the relationship I have with this man.

341
00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:55.230
Picture support, I don't even know what I'm looking at.

342
00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:59.579
Ricky, this is your last chance to tell everyone everything.

343
00:19:59.579 --> 00:20:03.579
And Shannon, why are you dragging Ricky into this?

344
00:20:03.579 --> 00:20:06.579
Sorry about enough, that you lost your shame.

345
00:20:06.579 --> 00:20:10.839
Why are you trying to drag another person down with you?

346
00:20:10.839 --> 00:20:13.839
Shannon, I know you've always liked Ricky, but you don't have to make him lie for you.

347
00:20:13.839 --> 00:20:16.059
Karen is right.

348
00:20:16.059 --> 00:20:20.480
Shannon, it's an embarrassment to be your classmate.

349
00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:24.480
If you had any self-respect, you would drop out.

350
00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:27.480
You want me to drop out?

351
00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:30.569
What do you all say, classmates?

352
00:20:30.569 --> 00:20:36.990
If she doesn't drop out, do we really want this scum to be in our school?

353
00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:37.990
Drop out.

354
00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:38.990
Drop out.

355
00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:39.990
Drop.

356
00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:40.990
Drop.

357
00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:42.599
Drop.

358
00:20:42.599 --> 00:20:44.940
Come on.

359
00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:45.940
Shut up.

360
00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:57.480
I'm kind of pointing out to this bullshit.

361
00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:00.549
Dean, please stand up for us.

362
00:21:00.549 --> 00:21:05.549
All the evidence points towards Shannon having a sugar daddy and being a bully.

363
00:21:05.549 --> 00:21:06.549
Just gonna kick her out.

364
00:21:06.549 --> 00:21:07.549
She's a disgrace.

365
00:21:07.549 --> 00:21:08.549
A disgrace.

366
00:21:08.549 --> 00:21:12.549
Jess, especially with the new board member attending today's ceremony,

367
00:21:12.549 --> 00:21:18.549
you have to deal with Shannon properly in order to maintain the school's reputation.

368
00:21:18.549 --> 00:21:21.609
Indeed, improper behavior must be punished.

369
00:21:21.609 --> 00:21:24.710
So tell me, how do you think I should handle it?

370
00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:27.710
I mean, as Dean, where should I do it?

371
00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:29.710
Shannon, did you hear that?

372
00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:32.710
The Dean is finally going to deal with you.

373
00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:35.710
Dean, I suggest you expel her from the school.

374
00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:37.710
No one wants her here.

375
00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:40.059
Yes, you're sure?

376
00:21:40.059 --> 00:21:43.319
And you're in your final year of university.

377
00:21:43.319 --> 00:21:48.319
If I were to expel someone from your class, they wouldn't receive a diploma.

378
00:21:48.319 --> 00:21:52.319
And all the hard work our last few years would just be for nothing.

379
00:21:52.319 --> 00:21:53.319
So what?

380
00:21:53.319 --> 00:21:56.569
That's the price she pays for doing something wrong.

381
00:21:56.569 --> 00:22:02.640
She should be severely punished as an example for others.

382
00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:07.640
Otherwise, we would have to call this place a brothel instead of a university.

383
00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:14.640
So, you will agree that improper conduct causes harm to other students?

384
00:22:15.859 --> 00:22:19.890
And tarnishes the university's reputation, you should be expelled.

385
00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:20.890
Is that right?

386
00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:26.220
No doubt about it.

387
00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:28.220
Disgusting person should be expelled.

388
00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:29.220
What do you think, Shannon?

389
00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:32.220
A clear conscience is a sure card.

390
00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:37.700
You know, Dean, maybe that's not expelling Shannon right away.

391
00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:46.700
Maybe she admits that she made a mistake in front of everyone and gets down on her knees and begs.

392
00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:48.700
Maybe the students will forgive her.

393
00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:55.119
Wait, you want me to kneel down and beg for forgiveness?

394
00:22:55.119 --> 00:22:58.119
Well, wouldn't that harm my reputation even more?

395
00:22:58.119 --> 00:23:02.119
Shannon, would you just apologize so we can end this already?

396
00:23:02.119 --> 00:23:04.119
Things can go back to the way they used to be.

397
00:23:04.119 --> 00:23:06.119
Apologize.

398
00:23:06.119 --> 00:23:10.119
Ricky, do you want to tell everyone what's going on?

399
00:23:10.119 --> 00:23:12.119
And who this man means to me?

400
00:23:12.119 --> 00:23:14.119
Or who are you?

401
00:23:14.119 --> 00:23:16.119
Do you want to reveal to everyone who you truly are?

402
00:23:17.119 --> 00:23:20.119
What does my identity have to do with you?

403
00:23:20.119 --> 00:23:22.119
Looks like you're too scared to say it.

404
00:23:22.119 --> 00:23:23.119
Okay.

405
00:23:23.119 --> 00:23:25.119
I'm going to do it myself.

406
00:23:25.119 --> 00:23:30.470
Ladies and gentlemen, Ricky Trax is the son of a chauffeur.

407
00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:31.470
My chauffeur.

408
00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:40.670
You're just a poor boy trying to spend my money to look cool for you idiots.

409
00:23:40.670 --> 00:23:42.670
Ricky is the son of a driver?

410
00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:48.670
Shannon really did pay for his birthday party and he lied by saying it was his card all along.

411
00:23:48.670 --> 00:23:50.670
Shannon, I'm so sick of your shit.

412
00:23:50.670 --> 00:23:51.670
I'm done giving you words.

413
00:23:51.670 --> 00:23:53.670
I cannot tolerate anymore.

414
00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:55.670
I've done everything that I get for you.

415
00:23:55.670 --> 00:23:56.670
I get caring for you.

416
00:23:56.670 --> 00:23:57.670
I've done so much.

417
00:23:57.670 --> 00:23:58.670
Ask him.

418
00:23:58.670 --> 00:23:59.670
What?

419
00:23:59.670 --> 00:24:01.670
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

420
00:24:01.670 --> 00:24:02.960
Hi.

421
00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:05.960
Did you just do the fucking hit me?

422
00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:06.960
Yeah.

423
00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:07.960
I did.

424
00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:08.960
What's the thing?

425
00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:11.960
Ricky Trax, my family, the Clark's practically raised you.

426
00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:14.960
And yet you are still an ungrateful little shit.

427
00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:18.559
Just like your father.

428
00:24:18.559 --> 00:24:21.750
That's Shannon's sugar daddy.

429
00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:23.750
He's a member of the board.

430
00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:26.289
What are you going to do?

431
00:24:26.289 --> 00:24:31.289
What's everyone going to think when they find out you're sleeping with a student?

432
00:24:31.289 --> 00:24:33.289
What's your family going to think?

433
00:24:33.289 --> 00:24:34.289
Karen, shut up.

434
00:24:34.289 --> 00:24:35.289
Do you even know who he is?

435
00:24:35.289 --> 00:24:37.289
Don't don't care who he is.

436
00:24:37.289 --> 00:24:39.289
He's sleeping with a student.

437
00:24:39.289 --> 00:24:40.289
He should be in jail.

438
00:24:40.289 --> 00:24:41.289
Just shut up.

439
00:24:41.289 --> 00:24:43.579
Shout out and come here.

440
00:24:43.579 --> 00:24:45.579
Move away from me creepy little girl.

441
00:24:45.579 --> 00:24:49.950
Let me introduce myself.

442
00:24:49.950 --> 00:24:52.950
I am Reginald Francis Alawithis Clark.

443
00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:55.980
And I am the newest member here at the Roses Academy.

444
00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:58.980
I'm also the head of the Alumni Association.

445
00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:01.980
As well I am on the state board of business affairs.

446
00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:05.980
This beautiful young woman is my daughter Shannon.

447
00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:10.109
And I have loved, cherished and protected her since the day she was born.

448
00:25:10.109 --> 00:25:17.109
And yet some of you think it is appropriate to humiliate, insult and damage her reputation.

449
00:25:17.109 --> 00:25:19.109
Let me tell you, this is your worst day.

450
00:25:19.109 --> 00:25:20.109
No.

451
00:25:20.109 --> 00:25:21.109
No.

452
00:25:21.109 --> 00:25:22.109
No.

453
00:25:22.109 --> 00:25:24.109
He's got to be an imposter.

454
00:25:24.109 --> 00:25:25.109
Karen.

455
00:25:25.109 --> 00:25:26.109
Stop talking.

456
00:25:26.109 --> 00:25:27.109
What is that?

457
00:25:27.109 --> 00:25:28.109
What is going on here?

458
00:25:28.109 --> 00:25:29.109
Look at that.

459
00:25:29.109 --> 00:25:30.109
What is happening?

460
00:25:30.109 --> 00:25:31.109
What is happening here?

461
00:25:31.109 --> 00:25:36.109
Earlier some of you students were talking about those who have questionable morals that would

462
00:25:36.109 --> 00:25:41.109
willfully hurt another student and damage the reputation of this school.

463
00:25:41.109 --> 00:25:42.109
That they should be expelled.

464
00:25:42.109 --> 00:25:43.109
Is it that correct team?

465
00:25:43.109 --> 00:25:44.109
Yes.

466
00:25:44.109 --> 00:25:45.109
Very well.

467
00:25:45.109 --> 00:25:47.109
The protocols in place then.

468
00:25:47.109 --> 00:25:51.109
Those who have spread these vicious lies and rumors will be expelled.

469
00:25:51.109 --> 00:25:52.109
Correct?

470
00:25:52.109 --> 00:25:53.109
Yes sir.

471
00:25:53.109 --> 00:25:54.109
Mr. Clark.

472
00:25:54.109 --> 00:25:56.109
Sir, it's not like that.

473
00:25:56.109 --> 00:26:00.109
I didn't know that Shannon was your daughter.

474
00:26:00.109 --> 00:26:02.109
I did not do it on purpose.

475
00:26:02.109 --> 00:26:04.109
You did not do it on purpose.

476
00:26:04.109 --> 00:26:06.519
You mean you didn't know.

477
00:26:06.519 --> 00:26:11.519
To every student who participated in bullying my daughter, you will never work in this city.

478
00:26:11.519 --> 00:26:13.519
And as for the ringleaders.

479
00:26:13.519 --> 00:26:14.519
Karen.

480
00:26:14.519 --> 00:26:15.519
Ricky.

481
00:26:15.519 --> 00:26:16.519
Yancey.

482
00:26:16.519 --> 00:26:20.519
I suggest you pull out your cheap little phones and book flights the hell out of this city

483
00:26:20.519 --> 00:26:21.519
and move far.

484
00:26:21.519 --> 00:26:22.519
Far away.

485
00:26:22.519 --> 00:26:24.359
Now it's over.

486
00:26:24.359 --> 00:26:25.359
I'm finished.

487
00:26:25.359 --> 00:26:26.390
Mr. Clark.

488
00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:30.390
Even if the rumors about you aren't real.

489
00:26:30.390 --> 00:26:36.390
It doesn't change the fact that Shannon used your money to keep Johnny as an oi toy.

490
00:26:36.390 --> 00:26:39.390
Are you saying my daughter brought Johnny?

491
00:26:39.390 --> 00:26:40.390
Johnny Wonder?

492
00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:41.390
Yep.

493
00:26:41.390 --> 00:26:44.390
Don't you see the way she dangles all over him?

494
00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:50.390
We're suggesting that the Clark family has the money powered influence to buy Johnny Wonder.

495
00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:52.390
Do you know who he is?

496
00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:53.390
What?

497
00:26:53.390 --> 00:26:54.390
Pay attention.

498
00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:56.390
You've heard of the Boy Prince.

499
00:26:56.390 --> 00:26:59.390
Air to the biggest conglomerate in the city.

500
00:26:59.390 --> 00:27:04.390
The family that owns 99.9% of every building in the city.

501
00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:06.609
That is Johnny Wonder.

502
00:27:06.609 --> 00:27:08.609
He is the Boy Prince.

503
00:27:08.609 --> 00:27:09.609
Johnny.

504
00:27:09.609 --> 00:27:11.609
Johnny is Boy Wonder.

505
00:27:11.609 --> 00:27:14.609
That's not, that's just not.

506
00:27:14.609 --> 00:27:16.609
And what do you expect?

507
00:27:16.609 --> 00:27:17.609
He owns the city.

508
00:27:17.609 --> 00:27:18.609
Karen.

509
00:27:18.609 --> 00:27:19.609
No.

510
00:27:19.609 --> 00:27:20.609
No.

511
00:27:20.609 --> 00:27:22.609
That's not possible.

512
00:27:22.609 --> 00:27:23.609
No.

513
00:27:23.609 --> 00:27:26.829
I don't believe.

514
00:27:26.829 --> 00:27:29.960
You two are both as good as finished.

515
00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:31.960
Whether or not you believe it.

516
00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:33.960
It makes no difference at all.

517
00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:34.960
Mr. Dean.

518
00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:36.210
If you please.

519
00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:37.210
No.

520
00:27:37.210 --> 00:27:38.210
No.

521
00:27:38.210 --> 00:27:39.210
No, no, no.

522
00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:40.210
Don't.

523
00:27:40.210 --> 00:27:41.210
Don't.

524
00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:42.210
Don't!

525
00:27:42.210 --> 00:27:43.240
Miss.

526
00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:44.240
Oh, no.

527
00:27:44.240 --> 00:28:07.119
Mr. Clark, those two have proven themselves to be incredibly malicious people who go to any length it takes to hurt the Shannon.

528
00:28:07.119 --> 00:28:10.190
I request you allow me to deal with them my own way.

529
00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:11.190
Of course.

530
00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:12.799
Thank you.

531
00:28:12.799 --> 00:28:15.559
Shannon.

532
00:28:15.559 --> 00:28:17.559
I told you that I would give you a gift.

533
00:28:17.559 --> 00:28:18.619
It disarmed.

534
00:28:18.619 --> 00:28:19.619
Oh, hold on.

535
00:28:19.619 --> 00:28:26.940
Johnny, I'm so grateful to have you with my life.

536
00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:35.900
have you in my life. And when I first met you, I felt mixed emotions of gratitude, but I couldn't

537
00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:41.839
help but fall in love with you. We've already missed on so much time and I don't want to waste

538
00:28:41.839 --> 00:28:51.470
anymore, so let's get married right away. Wait, you are the one proposing to me? Shannon, I have

539
00:28:51.470 --> 00:29:00.460
to tell you something. I know that I missed you once before. You know, I lost you in a previous life,

540
00:29:01.359 --> 00:29:06.960
but in this life, I promise I will always be with you. In this life, you will never suffer.

541
00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:15.400
You remember too. In my next life, I'm gonna make sure you are that happiest woman in the world.

542
00:29:17.130 --> 00:29:22.410
It's really nice to see you again. It's a pleasure to see you too.

543
00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:29.259
Do you want to know if I want to be pursued? The second time, shall he hurt you before?

544
00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:33.500
I'm so embarrassed that I haven't been there for you. I want you to know that from now on,

545
00:29:34.059 --> 00:29:53.599
I will always protect this clock. Thank you, Johnny. Thank you, universe, for the second chance.

546
00:29:54.319 --> 00:30:01.309
Oh, what happened? Oh, Johnny, I can't wait to be with you in this life and in every other.
