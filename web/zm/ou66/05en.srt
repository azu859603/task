1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:09,679
What? You've got to tell me everything that's happened, because I don't remember anything after that goddamn wedding.

2
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:12,679
What? What are you talking about?

3
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:23,370
Trust me. I feel like I'm still 21. I have no clue what happened during those past few years.

4
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:29,370
Oh, I'm genuinely sorry if I did your wrong. You'll always be my best friend.

5
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:33,369
Wait, wait. So you just lost your memory, huh?

6
00:00:33,369 --> 00:00:40,369
Your mind has raised all the unhappy moments about your past.

7
00:00:40,369 --> 00:00:45,369
But Patrick, should I be happy? I'm having my passion.

8
00:00:45,369 --> 00:00:50,369
You should be. If you hadn't been happy, I would have been happy for you too.

9
00:00:50,369 --> 00:01:00,189
But I've been hurt so many times because of Patrick and Vivian.

10
00:01:00,189 --> 00:01:05,290
And I bet your amnesia has something to do with them.

11
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:09,290
So you know, Vivian too.

12
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:12,950
Who's she?

13
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:16,950
Patrick's childhood friend, always by his side.

14
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:25,209
It treats her like a sister, but who knows what their relationship is really like.

15
00:01:25,209 --> 00:01:29,530
How much? My life is frustrating.

16
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:33,530
Girl, just forget about it.

17
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:40,530
You know, there are plenty of guys out there waiting to be picked.

18
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:46,780
Maybe it's time for you to get back into the dating pool.

19
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:52,170
From the gentleman over there.

20
00:01:52,170 --> 00:02:09,629
Fine. I don't even like this kind of...

21
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,949
We're in old places.

22
00:02:11,949 --> 00:02:14,949
Hey, I don't need to hear your critique of my taste, okay?

23
00:02:14,949 --> 00:02:16,949
Fine, I'll just stick with you.

24
00:02:16,949 --> 00:02:18,949
The usual is. Thank you.

25
00:02:18,949 --> 00:02:21,210
Oh, it's fun, me.
