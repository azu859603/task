00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I'm not going to haunt you man.

2
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.320
What about we'll make it back?

3
00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:13.089
If you win, you don't have to go.

4
00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:15.330
What kind of pledge are we talking about?

5
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.809
Since we like drinking so much.

6
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.960
This is my favorite bottle.

7
00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:31.780
If you guess the origin and the air, you can skip the event.

8
00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.869
Oh my god.

9
00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:38.829
She doesn't even know how to probably bring whiskey.

10
00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.350
Seriously, who drinks whiskey like that?

11
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:45.840
It's good mornin' you.

12
00:00:47.439 --> 00:00:50.320
Eight-in-year blossom collector's edition.

13
00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.929
How do you know the name?

14
00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:53.890
You must be cheating.

15
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.649
Why do I have memories of this whiskey?
