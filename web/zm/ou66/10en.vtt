Our food is prepared with organic ingredients, no additives, no artificial coloring, no GMOs.

2
00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.759
Honey, that's some well-designed cook for a restaurant.

3
00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.039
Thank you!

4
00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:16.000
Well, I personally designed everything you see here.

5
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:22.719
And as the founder of the first vegetarian restaurant under the mood hotel chain,

6
00:00:22.719 --> 00:00:27.920
I would like to express my gratitude to Patrick Miller,

7
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.840
the CEO of the hotel chain for his support of this project.

8
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:34.960
A round of applause!

9
00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.579
Even in Patrick's ruling match made in heaven.

10
00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.979
Has Patrick not divorced his losing wife yet?

11
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.950
I think he should definitely marry Vivian.

12
00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.030
I've heard they're on the bad terms.

13
00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.590
I've never even seen just me wearing these singles,

14
00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.030
but Patrick showers weird with desired dresses.

15
00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:57.789
I've heard even worse.

16
00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:00.109
Apparently, Gomez's mailer,

17
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.299
all over Vivian's old clothes isn't that hilarious?

18
00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.780
Really?

19
00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.129
Now everyone knows Patrick loves me more.

20
00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:15.010
Jasmine gets ready to be left by everyone for how miserable you are.

21
00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:17.519
One place.
