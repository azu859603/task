1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,960
Is she wearing hot couture? Her dress is stunning.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:08,880
Shut up, I know that why the dress looks completely handcrafted.

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,679
I really need to know the designer.

4
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:12,080
Me too.

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,710
Sorry, honey.

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,160
I'm late.

7
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:24,219
Oh my God.

8
00:00:24,219 --> 00:00:27,289
Is this supposed to be Patric's ugly wife?

9
00:00:27,289 --> 00:00:29,289
But she's so pretty.

10
00:00:29,289 --> 00:00:32,890
Seems like whole rumors about her were completely fake.

11
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:35,890
She and Patric is perfect for each other.

12
00:00:39,869 --> 00:00:44,100
Just mean, I'll make sure you embarrass yourself today.

13
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,100
Hello there.

14
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:51,100
At this year's wife, I'm sure you have excellent taste.

15
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:56,100
So may I ask you, what do you think of our restaurant design concept?

16
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,829
Well, I guess being pretty is her only trait.

17
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:02,829
She must be dumb.

18
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:04,829
I can't believe she can't even answer a simple question.

19
00:01:04,829 --> 00:01:13,569
Oh, and the hind work environment is clearly not for a house by like you.

20
00:01:13,569 --> 00:01:15,569
Maybe you should go home and cook.

21
00:01:15,569 --> 00:01:19,209
I was just thinking, oh, really?

22
00:01:19,209 --> 00:01:24,209
You mentioned your design was inspired by the Bauhaus.

23
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:30,209
But to me, it looks like a total ripoff of Euler's famous architectural work.

24
00:01:30,209 --> 00:01:39,379
He didn't touch rice.

25
00:01:39,379 --> 00:01:44,379
I've never even seen Euler's work.

26
00:01:44,379 --> 00:01:45,379
Really?

27
00:01:45,379 --> 00:01:46,379
Yes.

28
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:50,379
But his work is a must study for every interior designer.

29
00:01:50,379 --> 00:01:55,379
And if you're not familiar with it, that means you don't even know the basics.

30
00:01:55,379 --> 00:01:57,379
Well, well, well.

31
00:01:57,379 --> 00:01:58,379
Patric.

32
00:01:58,379 --> 00:02:01,859
Nice, Jasmine. He's an interrogator like that.

33
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:04,859
It seems like she's enjoying humiliating me.

34
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:06,859
Both of us.

35
00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:08,860
Maybe there's some research next time.

36
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:17,069
If you decide to show off.

37
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:18,069
Oh, come.

38
00:02:18,069 --> 00:02:21,099
I didn't even know you knew about this stuff.

39
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:24,099
You know nothing, Patrick Miller.

40
00:02:24,099 --> 00:02:28,099
Mrs. Miller, I didn't realize you were smart as you're beautiful.

41
00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:32,099
I would be delighted to invite you to my art studio sometime soon.

42
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:33,099
Cheers.

43
00:02:33,099 --> 00:02:34,099
Cheers.

44
00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:43,719
A minute.

45
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:45,780
Mrs. Miller pregnant.

46
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:46,780
Oh!

47
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:47,849
Oh!

48
00:02:47,849 --> 00:02:48,849
Michael is relation.

49
00:02:48,849 --> 00:03:02,300
When was your last period?

50
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,300
I don't remember.

51
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,069
What kind of question is that?

52
00:03:06,069 --> 00:03:08,069
So, you're not pregnant, are you?

53
00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:10,159
Pregnant?

54
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,789
How can I be pregnant?

55
00:03:13,789 --> 00:03:26,219
I can't be screaming.

56
00:03:26,219 --> 00:03:31,400
Did you lose all interest in me?

57
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,620
That car accident really turned everything upside down.

58
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:38,750
I really need to find out what's gotten into her tonight.

59
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:59,310
Patrick, what are you doing here?

60
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:02,599
I thought you didn't even like me.

61
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:06,400
I remember what you said last night.

62
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,400
When we made love.

63
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:12,719
Last time?

64
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:17,300
The only thing I remember is being mentally in love with him.

65
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,300
But how do my feelings before it turned 21?

66
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,300
You said you wanted something wild.

67
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:31,000
You said you wanted being my slave until your legs hurt.

68
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I... I did.

69
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:52,829
I know we shouldn't say yes to this jerk.

70
00:04:52,829 --> 00:04:55,829
But damn, I lied to him for so long.

71
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:56,829
Yes.

72
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:57,959
I'll be your slave.

73
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:03,339
Be honest.

74
00:05:03,339 --> 00:05:11,850
Have you lost your memory or something?

75
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:12,850
What's in his dad?

76
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:14,910
You know, I said this worst to me.

77
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:16,910
I was tricking you.

78
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:20,550
His celebrity's suspicious looks like I have to play alone.

79
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:25,300
Yeah.

80
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:52,980
What is sad sounds so nice, since you want to make it happen?

81
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,980
I thought you were always prepared.

82
00:05:54,980 --> 00:06:00,069
I mean, you were in charge of supply after all.

83
00:06:00,069 --> 00:06:01,550
What?

84
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:07,230
Be prepared, can't you?

85
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:09,230
So you do want to have my baby?

86
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:18,420
Talking about and why the hell did you plummet to my back in the middle of the night?

87
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,420
Don't you know what consent means?

88
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,420
But we were scheduled for today.

89
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,420
Have you really forgotten?

90
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,420
It's how you arranged.

91
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:26,480
Scaredled sex?

92
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,480
Why would it come up with something so ridiculous?

93
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:32,920
Listen, if you don't want to slip with me,

94
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,660
why?

95
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,660
But don't accuse me of breaking the rules we made when we got married.

96
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:40,660
So he only slept with me because it was his dinner.

97
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,660
I was so pathetic.

98
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:43,660
I get it now.

99
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:46,839
Just leave me alone.

100
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:49,839
You don't have to make any fantasies come true anymore.

101
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:53,449
We'll be strangers in this house for now on.

102
00:06:53,449 --> 00:07:07,060
Why do I feel sad and lost?

103
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:11,089
Isn't this what I always wanted?

104
00:07:11,089 --> 00:07:18,089
Finally, some free time to sit the exhibition.

105
00:07:18,089 --> 00:07:47,930
I stuck her in real daylight.

106
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:49,930
What is this world coming to?

107
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:59,410
This is Miller.

108
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:00,410
It was a detective here.

109
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:05,699
You're hot.

110
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:07,699
I did my job pretty well.

111
00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:19,670
Didn't I?

112
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:26,500
I can't believe I actually hired a detective to stack my husband like some privilege room.

113
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:35,250
Now it's time to pay.

114
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:38,460
To $100,000.

115
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:39,460
To $100,000?

116
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:42,460
Where am I going to get that much money?

117
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:53,070
Try this one.

118
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:57,309
What a great business deal.

119
00:08:57,309 --> 00:09:02,500
Making money from Boss, Jasmine and Vivian.

120
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,500
Jasmine brought a lot of negative publicity to the restaurant.

121
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,500
And fixing this will cost money.

122
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,500
You wouldn't hesitate to spend whatever it takes, right?

123
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,500
It's not about the money.

124
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,500
I promised you our parents I'd take care of you.

125
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:19,179
But are you really taking that project seriously?

126
00:09:19,179 --> 00:09:22,179
Patrick, I swear on my grave.

127
00:09:22,179 --> 00:09:25,210
This is the last time going to cost you money.

128
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:26,750
Please, believe me.

129
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,750
I'll do better, please.

130
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:38,320
Jasmine just spent $100,000 on your card.

131
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,580
She's fucking crazy.

132
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,580
She's never used that card before.

133
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:48,700
Well, I think she's trying to get table with me.

134
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:56,759
So, you're going to let her spend $200,000 for no reason but won't help me with my problem?

135
00:09:56,759 --> 00:09:58,759
Don't mix things up.

136
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:00,759
I'll help you for the one last time.

137
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:03,759
Catch restaurant in order and stop embarrassing me in public.

138
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:11,309
As the real Mrs. Miller, I need to hurry up and get the studio worst.

139
00:10:11,309 --> 00:10:16,309
A bad Jasmine will go crazy again when she sees my photos with Patrick.

140
00:10:16,309 --> 00:10:23,179
I want it to work.

141
00:10:23,179 --> 00:10:27,000
No way. No way.

142
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,960
Why not?

143
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,960
Wouldn't it be better for you and your child who speak hard, Vivian?

144
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:39,340
These photos are not what they've seen like.

145
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,340
None of the admirers anymore.

146
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,340
I want it to work.

147
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,340
Again, I refuse.

148
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,340
Converse.

149
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,340
He's all yours.

150
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:54,679
Isn't that what you always wanted?

151
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:57,350
No, you're business.

152
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:59,639
Don't come into my office again.

153
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:01,639
Unless you have a valid reason.

154
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:08,350
You can't believe here if you used to do worse here.

155
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:10,350
I'm going to find another way to handle this.

156
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:25,149
Are you alright, sir?

157
00:11:25,149 --> 00:11:29,149
I haven't seen you this upset since you've handled the company's financial crisis.

158
00:11:29,149 --> 00:11:33,200
Tell me.

159
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,519
Why do you think Jasmine suddenly wants a divorce?

160
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,809
She knows that Vivian and I are just partners.

161
00:11:41,809 --> 00:11:47,700
I used to hate her irrational cleanliness but...

162
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,820
I was just a completely different person.

163
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,019
I feel divided.

164
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:57,879
Sir, Mrs. Miller is her own person, makes it possible to read her mind.

165
00:11:57,879 --> 00:12:01,879
Perhaps you should just talk to her to find out the reason.

166
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:03,710
I did.

167
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:08,740
It's probably because we didn't get intimate last time.

168
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:11,740
And so feels that I've been distant from her.

169
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:14,740
But haven't you always wanted to divorce her, sir?

170
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:17,210
Not anymore.

171
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:20,879
But now I'm going to plan a date for us.

172
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:25,259
She'll definitely fall in love with me all over again.

173
00:12:25,259 --> 00:12:36,059
Why isn't Jasmine back here?

174
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:37,059
Should I give her a call?

175
00:12:37,059 --> 00:12:42,059
We've invited a Michelin star chef to prepare steak tonight just for her.

176
00:12:42,059 --> 00:12:45,059
No, no. I don't want to sing to eager.

177
00:12:45,059 --> 00:13:04,659
I'm not eating.

178
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:10,889
Wait. I invited her Michelin star chef to make a steak tonight.

179
00:13:10,889 --> 00:13:14,889
What's it got to do with me? Don't you know that I don't even like steak?

180
00:13:14,889 --> 00:13:46,549
She doesn't like steak.

181
00:13:46,549 --> 00:13:53,980
So you are telling me that the fried chicken is better than the steak?

182
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:54,980
Yeah, this could be a dessert.

183
00:13:54,980 --> 00:14:27,500
Maybe I'm a taster.

184
00:14:27,500 --> 00:15:06,100
Use me this time.

185
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:09,740
You saved that trick.

186
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:33,980
I want to let you get away with this.

187
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:37,330
Sir, Mrs. John seems to be in serious pain.

188
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:40,639
You might want to take a look.

189
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:41,639
I'm not a doctor.

190
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:44,639
Tell her to just go to the hospital if that's serious.

191
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:51,620
Alright.

192
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:52,620
Not anymore.

193
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:56,100
What do you mean not anymore?

194
00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:02,580
You were ready to make love just a couple seconds ago.

195
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:04,580
I was in the mood.

196
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:05,580
But now I'm not.

197
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,580
Got a problem with that?

198
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:16,710
Now if you'll excuse me, Mr. Miller.

199
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:21,220
I'm going to leave you alone so you can enjoy a swim.

200
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:37,460
It was too close.

201
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:39,460
I almost let you get what you wanted.

202
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:44,830
I really need to get the divorce done as soon as possible.

203
00:16:44,830 --> 00:17:01,840
You're still working as reports, right?

204
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,840
I've got some scoop for you.

205
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,839
No need to thank me.

206
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,349
Sir.

207
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:12,450
Sir.

208
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:14,759
Is it now?

209
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:15,759
Who did this?

210
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:24,990
How did they get these photos?

211
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:29,299
Just one can say this.

212
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:31,299
Get it taken down immediately.

213
00:17:31,299 --> 00:17:34,569
I said immediately.

214
00:17:34,569 --> 00:17:35,569
Don't you hear me?

215
00:17:35,569 --> 00:17:36,569
Sir.

216
00:17:36,569 --> 00:17:37,569
I've already checked.

217
00:17:37,569 --> 00:17:40,569
These pictures were sold to the press by Mrs. Miller herself.

218
00:17:40,569 --> 00:17:48,190
Does she want?

219
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:51,190
Sir, maybe Mrs. Miller really wants a divorce this time.

220
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:56,359
I didn't get it.

221
00:17:56,359 --> 00:17:59,509
She was now like this.

222
00:17:59,509 --> 00:18:03,509
It was only me and her world that now people changed, sir.

223
00:18:03,509 --> 00:18:06,509
I suggest you talk to her to clear things up.

224
00:18:06,509 --> 00:18:09,819
Could you be in love with someone else?

225
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,880
Follow her every move and find out what she's up to.

226
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:38,380
It's the project I did in the college.

227
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,380
The hell didn't stop here.

228
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:53,259
Mine claim tricks on me.

229
00:18:53,259 --> 00:19:09,910
That name sounds so familiar.

230
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:19,869
Jasmine?

231
00:19:19,869 --> 00:19:23,660
Sorry.

232
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:28,279
Looks like Phoebe was right.

233
00:19:28,279 --> 00:19:30,279
She really doesn't remember anything.

234
00:19:30,279 --> 00:19:31,279
I know.

235
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:32,279
Phoebe's brother.

236
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:34,470
Is you don't remember me?

237
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:49,309
I've heard you already was in Patrick.

238
00:19:49,309 --> 00:19:50,440
Isn't it right?

239
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:54,759
Well, I realized this marriage isn't right for me.

240
00:19:56,019 --> 00:20:01,109
If I make her my wife, it would definitely boost the profits on my gallery.

241
00:20:01,109 --> 00:20:02,109
Good for you.

242
00:20:02,109 --> 00:20:07,109
You shouldn't settle for being just a housewife with all your talent.

243
00:20:07,109 --> 00:20:12,299
If you're interested, you can come and work at my gallery.

244
00:20:12,299 --> 00:20:15,849
Um, seriously?

245
00:20:15,849 --> 00:20:19,390
I don't really have enough experience.

246
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:20,390
Don't worry about that.

247
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:24,619
I've known you since you were 22.

248
00:20:24,619 --> 00:20:27,420
And they're exactly what you can do.

249
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,960
You'd make it great.

250
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,990
Art curator.

251
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:33,250
And it's awesome.

252
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,339
Art is my thing.

253
00:20:35,339 --> 00:20:41,539
And maybe you can catch me up on what's been happening in the art world over the past few years or so.

254
00:20:41,539 --> 00:20:44,730
I spent too much time at home.

255
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:46,730
Let's go to my office.

256
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:48,730
We can talk more there.

257
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:56,660
Sir, we've got the problem.

258
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,660
She wants to work.

259
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:00,819
It's some shitty gallery.

260
00:21:00,819 --> 00:21:05,099
I've never held a position at the company before.

261
00:21:05,099 --> 00:21:08,099
Maybe she's becoming more and more unbearable.

262
00:21:08,099 --> 00:21:12,920
I think you could try.

263
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:17,009
So I assume she'll be going to work tomorrow.

264
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:19,299
Let's see about that.

265
00:21:19,299 --> 00:21:25,160
To work?

266
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,160
We're getting to work soon.

267
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,160
So I gotta start looking out for myself.

268
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,160
You already have a great job.

269
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,160
Don't you remember?

270
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,670
Shit.

271
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:36,670
Do I really have a job?

272
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,670
I remember nothing about it.

273
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:45,990
I just don't want that job anymore.

274
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:47,990
I want to fresh start.

275
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:55,140
Guess I'll have Vivian to cover your old job.

276
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,140
Are you real?

277
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:59,140
There is no way she can handle the same job as me.

278
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:03,140
You'd be a friendly idiot if you gave her my position.

279
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:07,740
Bring me back before she screws everything up.

280
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:23,099
Hey, finally back.

281
00:22:23,099 --> 00:22:25,170
Did the boss reinstate you?

282
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:39,750
Yes, everybody looking at me so weirdly.

283
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,940
You don't remember?

284
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,579
Wait.

285
00:22:43,579 --> 00:22:46,579
You didn't hit your head during this car accident, did you?

286
00:22:46,579 --> 00:22:47,579
Who is not?

287
00:22:47,579 --> 00:22:49,619
I'm just curious, you know.

288
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:51,740
After all, I'm this your wife.

289
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:54,740
So it shouldn't come with the surprise that I'm here.

290
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,740
Oh, yeah.

291
00:22:55,740 --> 00:23:01,509
People are saying that you reported Vivian's restaurant out of your jealousy.

292
00:23:01,509 --> 00:23:06,509
That it was all Losey set up and you were just a liar.

293
00:23:06,509 --> 00:23:07,640
What?

294
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,640
Me, a liar?

295
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,640
No, I shouldn't be saying this.

296
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:15,900
But it's so Mr. Miller's fault for not knowing all of this.

297
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:21,369
After all, Vivian's restaurant clearly has issues.

298
00:23:21,369 --> 00:23:26,450
Um, let me test you.

299
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:28,450
What's my role at the company?

300
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:30,480
You're the art director.

301
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:35,480
You're mainly responsible for promoting the hotel and organizing high-end exhibitions.

302
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:40,569
And how's that related to Vivian's restaurant exactly?

303
00:23:40,569 --> 00:23:44,400
After her restaurant was renovated,

304
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,400
the CEO sent you to inspect it.

305
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:53,400
And you discovered that it didn't meet the safest standards.

306
00:23:53,400 --> 00:24:00,960
And when I told Patrick, he accused me of intentional defaming Vivian.

307
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:06,359
Let me just sign the complaint.

308
00:24:06,359 --> 00:24:07,359
Let's go.

309
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:09,359
We are going to get to the bottom of this now.

310
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:17,890
Well, let's walk.

311
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:18,890
Apologize to me.

312
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:19,890
Now.

313
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:26,660
What are you talking about?

314
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:27,660
The restaurant.

315
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,660
I never slander Vivian.

316
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,660
Both of you owe me an apology.

317
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:33,660
Oh, she's just me.

318
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:37,720
So you came back to work just to throw a tantrum?

319
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:43,180
Let me turn right now.

320
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:45,180
Whatever it is, we'll talk about later.

321
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:46,180
No.

322
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,180
Leave.

323
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:50,509
I'm so...

324
00:24:50,509 --> 00:24:51,509
Let's just...

325
00:24:51,509 --> 00:24:55,740
So weak.

326
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:56,740
This is all the evidence.

327
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:57,740
I had it that time.

328
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:01,740
I suggested it can all the look.

329
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:13,660
Why did you give them all the art to me?

330
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:17,660
Are you saying I didn't give you any of this before?

331
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:18,660
Yes.

332
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:24,900
Why wouldn't I have believed you otherwise?

333
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,900
Then you can check it now.

334
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,900
And if you still believe Vivian, after seeing these,

335
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:51,579
I have nothing to say.

336
00:25:51,579 --> 00:25:52,579
Just me.

337
00:25:52,579 --> 00:25:56,950
I know you want to see the test me.

338
00:25:56,950 --> 00:26:02,579
But this restaurant was my parent's dream.

339
00:26:02,579 --> 00:26:07,990
I will never, never let you take it away from me.

340
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:09,990
Vivian, are you out of your mind?

341
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:12,059
Patrick!

342
00:26:12,059 --> 00:26:14,759
You promised.

343
00:26:14,759 --> 00:26:16,759
You take care of me.

344
00:26:16,759 --> 00:26:26,789
I've done enough for you over these years.

345
00:26:26,789 --> 00:26:29,789
I'm sure they wouldn't blame you for anything.

346
00:26:29,789 --> 00:26:34,779
I'll definitely get to the bottom of this.

347
00:26:34,779 --> 00:26:41,630
I apologize.

348
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:48,980
What if I told you I can help you secure an exquisite collaboration with Isaac?

349
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:51,980
Isaac?

350
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:55,980
Does she mean this genius artist who's been off the radar for ages?

351
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:58,980
If she can really make that collaboration happen,

352
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:01,579
then the talent's going to hit the next level.

353
00:27:01,579 --> 00:27:04,579
The collaboration of the restaurant are two separate issues.

354
00:27:04,579 --> 00:27:08,680
I'm still getting to the bottom of this.

355
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:12,940
So, he's not a violent defendant, Vivian, after all.

356
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:26,690
I can secure the Isaac collaboration too.

357
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:30,690
Isaac is anonymous and highly acclaimed artist.

358
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:34,690
Not some dumb housewife you'd know.

359
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:40,920
Let's make a bet then.

360
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:44,920
If I can secure this collab, you'll hold a press conference

361
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,920
admitting your restaurant issues.

362
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:52,220
And apologize to me.

363
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,220
As you wish.

364
00:27:53,220 --> 00:28:05,359
But if you fail, you're out of this company immediately.

365
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:22,220
Do destroy you, Jessica.

366
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:25,220
Why would you make that stupid bad with Vivian?

367
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:30,819
Isaac rose to fame four years ago and then simply vanished.

368
00:28:30,819 --> 00:28:33,109
No one knew you since then.

369
00:28:33,109 --> 00:28:38,059
How would you even start to find that artist?

370
00:28:38,059 --> 00:28:40,059
Well, I've got a plan.

371
00:28:40,059 --> 00:28:41,920
Of course I do.

372
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:48,210
I have my own plan.

373
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:50,210
This is between me and Vivian.

374
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:51,210
It's none of your business.

375
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:53,210
Would you be none of my business?

376
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:55,849
You're my wife.

377
00:28:55,849 --> 00:29:01,470
Is he really concerned about me from once?

378
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:04,470
You're made bad with her in front of everyone.

379
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:07,730
How can I protect you if you lose?

380
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:16,579
So you think I'm guaranteed to lose?

381
00:29:16,579 --> 00:29:19,579
You've been under my wing all these years.

382
00:29:19,579 --> 00:29:21,579
How else can you ask for help?

383
00:29:21,579 --> 00:29:23,579
Maybe I could ask no of her help.

384
00:29:23,579 --> 00:29:36,700
Well, that's nothing you need to worry about.

385
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:43,549
Find the artist Isaac for me as soon as possible.

386
00:29:43,549 --> 00:29:44,549
You lose chance.

387
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:46,549
Is everything alright?

388
00:29:46,549 --> 00:29:48,549
I need your help with something.

389
00:29:48,549 --> 00:29:53,019
And you're the only person who can help me.

390
00:29:53,019 --> 00:29:54,019
No problem.

391
00:29:54,019 --> 00:29:56,019
Just tell me what it is.

392
00:29:56,019 --> 00:29:57,019
Thanks sweet fans.

393
00:29:57,019 --> 00:29:59,150
I just wanted to ask you.

394
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:02,309
Could you get in contact with Isaac?

395
00:30:02,309 --> 00:30:05,309
Well, it seems like you still hasn't remembered anything.

396
00:30:05,309 --> 00:30:06,309
It's urgent.

397
00:30:06,309 --> 00:30:08,309
And authorization for collaboration.

398
00:30:08,309 --> 00:30:14,720
Since your galleries showcases their work, you must know each other, right?

399
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,720
Yeah?

400
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,720
I know, Isaac.

401
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,720
I can help you.

402
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:22,259
But I needed to agree to one thing in return.

403
00:30:22,259 --> 00:30:24,259
And what would that be?

404
00:30:24,259 --> 00:30:41,299
Will you marry me?

405
00:30:41,299 --> 00:30:44,299
Jasmine, I've had feelings for you since college.

406
00:30:44,299 --> 00:30:46,299
But Patrick was always into me.

407
00:30:46,299 --> 00:30:50,359
Now that you're finally getting a divorce,

408
00:30:50,359 --> 00:30:52,359
let me be the one to treat you right.

409
00:30:52,359 --> 00:30:56,930
Liz, this is too sudden.

410
00:30:56,930 --> 00:31:00,759
I've always seen you as a friend.

411
00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:06,009
Looks like she's not as gullible as she seems.

412
00:31:06,009 --> 00:31:09,339
It's fine.

413
00:31:09,339 --> 00:31:11,339
I just wanted to express my feelings to you.

414
00:31:11,339 --> 00:31:13,890
We can take it slow.

415
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:18,589
After all, I've been waiting for you for so many years.

416
00:31:18,589 --> 00:31:21,589
How about if you're willing to rock in my gallery?

417
00:31:21,589 --> 00:31:23,819
I will help you with this.

418
00:31:23,819 --> 00:31:25,819
Isaac, is that okay?

419
00:31:25,819 --> 00:31:27,819
Why am I thinking about Patrick even now?

420
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:30,819
Could I still have feelings for him?

421
00:31:30,819 --> 00:31:36,650
I'm here.

422
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:43,700
I'm sorry, but I need some time to think about it.

423
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:59,890
I can gather authorization for Isaac alone.

424
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:05,599
Of course we will.

425
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:07,599
We are allies of this one.
