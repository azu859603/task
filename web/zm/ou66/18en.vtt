00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.589
Why should I tell you?

2
00:00:02.589 --> 00:00:03.589
She was not.

3
00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:09.619
My future sister. In law, yes, she wanted to see my brother, why?

4
00:00:09.619 --> 00:00:13.619
I'm going to bring her back. She can't sleep anywhere but our house.

5
00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:17.289
Look at those dark circles under her eyes.

6
00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:23.140
It seems like you're the one who can sleep when she's not around.

7
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.140
I'll wait for her here if I have to.

8
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.140
And I won't leave until I find her.

9
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.579
When I know what it would take for Jasmine to forgive you,

10
00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.420
give me one million and I will tell you.

11
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.460
Give me your bank account number.

12
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.020
Oh my you two are literally the same.

13
00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.020
What do you mean?

14
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.020
I mean that you won't win her back like this.

15
00:00:52.020 --> 00:01:01.219
Think about it.

16
00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:04.420
Everybody's telling me to think, Jasmine.

17
00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.769
I thought hard but I still don't know what you're thinking.

18
00:01:09.769 --> 00:01:23.329
Sydney got Isaac's club's authorization.
