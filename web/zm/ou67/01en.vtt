00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.500
I can't believe I'm marrying a stranger today.

2
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:17.829
Remember Ashley, your father's still in a coma.

3
00:00:17.829 --> 00:00:21.829
We can't afford to offend Hamilton's now.

4
00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:25.829
Shouldn't you do your part for your father and the company?

5
00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:31.679
Why me? It's core they want.

6
00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.679
Why, because you, my dear sister, have lived comfortably all your life

7
00:00:35.679 --> 00:00:38.679
while I suffered in poverty with our mother.

8
00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:41.679
Plus, you're the only one that can do this for me.

9
00:00:41.679 --> 00:00:44.350
Because we have the same pace.

10
00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:52.960
This is your only chance to save your father.

11
00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.359
Fine. I'll do it.

12
00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:00.770
Are they forcing me to do this?

13
00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.769
Are the rumors true? Is Tristan really blind?

14
00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:24.239
You have to. Green Spice's ingredients are essential for our perfume products.

15
00:01:24.239 --> 00:01:27.239
This marriage alliance is necessary.

16
00:01:27.239 --> 00:01:30.239
Why exactly is my happiness not necessary?

17
00:01:30.239 --> 00:01:33.239
Because I'm useless to you now, and fucking blind!

18
00:01:33.239 --> 00:01:37.299
You're being ridiculous!

19
00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:40.299
Now, father, don't get upset.

20
00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:47.180
It's understandable, considering his... impediment.

21
00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.180
Sir, everybody's waiting for you inside.

22
00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:57.079
Just remember, we're still the leading candidate for CEO of the Hamilton Group.

23
00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:14.620
The ceremony. You can't let anyone know you're blind.
