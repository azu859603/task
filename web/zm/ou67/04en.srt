1
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:08,410
We're out approaching.

2
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:09,410
Ten feet away.

3
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:13,509
Five feet.

4
00:00:13,509 --> 00:00:16,879
She's there.

5
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:21,469
Turn and pace her.

6
00:00:21,469 --> 00:00:22,469
Honored guests.

7
00:00:22,469 --> 00:00:26,469
Today we are gathered to celebrate the union of these two.

8
00:00:26,469 --> 00:00:28,469
Let's begin with exchange of rings.

9
00:00:28,469 --> 00:00:31,579
She has a ring handout.

10
00:00:31,579 --> 00:00:38,990
The ring is in your left.

11
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:45,530
Off.

12
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:46,909
Lower.

13
00:00:46,909 --> 00:00:47,909
Higher, higher.

14
00:00:47,909 --> 00:00:53,460
We're right there.

15
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:54,460
It's going on with the ring.

16
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:55,460
You missed completely.

17
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:59,159
Are the rumors really true?

18
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:02,729
Does the groom really find?

19
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:05,590
Let me read position.

20
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:11,299
Hey.

21
00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:17,989
Excuse me?

22
00:01:17,989 --> 00:01:20,879
The ring.

23
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:21,879
Hintra.

24
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:26,049
Told you.

25
00:01:26,049 --> 00:01:27,049
Tristan is blind.
