00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.480
Where are we going as per the agreement you insisted on?

2
00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:09.160
The newlyweds are to cohabitate after the wedding

3
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:16.039
So attending the ceremony was just the first step Corin Vanessa had this all planned out. They want to kick me out of my own home

4
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.120
Right over here

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:40.700
Miss screen your room is actually on the second floor. Let me help you. No need

6
00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.420
You can carry your own things you're not a vacation Cora starting tomorrow

7
00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.700
You'll tend to all of my needs you're no longer the green heiress in this house

8
00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:53.579
You're nothing more than I made

9
00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.240
Why should I listen to you?

10
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:09.519
The complete marriage agreement a violation penalty of five million you and your mother were so eager for this marriage

11
00:01:09.519 --> 00:01:11.560
Did you not even read the contract before you signed it?

12
00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.629
Seriously Cora, how many goddamn contracts have you signed?
