00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.600
I didn't mean to, I swear.

2
00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:04.000
Come on, Cori, you did that on purpose.

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.799
No.

4
00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:08.400
Why did you marry me? And why are you really here?

5
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.400
I was also forced into this marriage.

6
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.400
Since we're in the same boat, we could work something out.

7
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.929
Oh.

8
00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.140
I could be your eyes.

9
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.359
Yeah, but we're not in the same boat.

10
00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:26.329
Hamilton Group doesn't need green spice, we have other options.

11
00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:29.289
Like who? Victoria?

12
00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:32.060
No, she's only a mean.

13
00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.060
Greatest independent perfumer in all Europe.

14
00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.060
I think we could afford her too.

15
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.060
You wish.

16
00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.439
Pass me a towel.

17
00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:51.500
Close her eyes.

18
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.170
Help.

19
00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.170
I forgot your mind.

20
00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:15.299
Cora.

21
00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.829
Cora, where's my towel?
