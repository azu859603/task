1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.740
Oh, that was quite a good honey.

2
00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:12.740
Who are you people?

3
00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:13.740
How'd you get in here?

4
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:14.740
I'm Leslie.

5
00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:15.740
You're stylist.

6
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:16.739
Yes.

7
00:00:16.739 --> 00:00:17.739
Hi.

8
00:00:17.739 --> 00:00:18.739
Nice to meet you.

9
00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:19.739
This is my styling team.

10
00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:22.219
Tristan specifically called us over to get you ready for tonight.

11
00:00:22.219 --> 00:00:23.219
Right?

12
00:00:23.219 --> 00:00:24.219
Yeah.

13
00:00:24.219 --> 00:00:25.219
No time for that honey.

14
00:00:25.219 --> 00:00:26.219
We gotta get you changed.

15
00:00:26.219 --> 00:00:28.079
Girls, let's move.

16
00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:29.210
Oh no.

17
00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.489
Two eighties.

18
00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:32.490
Two plain.

19
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.420
We'll put that in there.

20
00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:36.420
Two gaudy.

21
00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:39.539
Oh.

22
00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:43.289
The one.

23
00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:46.179
Oh, you look fabulous.

24
00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:48.179
Just one last touch.

25
00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:49.219
There we go.

26
00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:50.219
Oh honey.

27
00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.219
Oh, I've done myself.

28
00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:55.380
Honey, them Grammy people don't have anything on you.

29
00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.380
That's a scream.

30
00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.890
Looks absolutely stunning.

31
00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.890
It's in the compassion cup.

32
00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:01.890
Did I ask you?

33
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.890
No, you wanted to.

34
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.180
Thank you.

35
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.180
I love it.

36
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.180
It's too bad you can't see.

37
00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.739
But I can smell.

38
00:01:15.739 --> 00:01:19.829
You have a very distinct scent.

39
00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:23.209
Does he recognize me?

40
00:01:23.209 --> 00:01:34.189
Louis Carey, two o'clock.

41
00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:36.189
CEO of LC Group.

42
00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:39.480
But you come by the office later and discuss it in more detail.

43
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.480
He's coming over.

44
00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.480
Looks like he's going to shake your hand.

45
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:43.480
Tristan.

46
00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:44.480
Long time no see.

47
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.480
Yeah, I got some great news for you.

48
00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:47.480
Let me guess.

49
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.480
The product pass inspection.

50
00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.480
Exactly.

51
00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.480
I was curious if your company is still interested in a partnership.

52
00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:54.480
Of course.

53
00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.480
Let's discuss the details later.

54
00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.480
And this must be your new lovely wife.

55
00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:59.480
Pleasure to meet you.

56
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:00.480
You too.

57
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.480
I'm very fond of your newly developed Iron Jasmine.

58
00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.480
I admire the LC Group's dedication to sourcing new natural ingredients

59
00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.479
from unexplored regions and varietals.

60
00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.960
I was expected by the Green family heiress.

61
00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.960
Truly knowledgeable and perfumory.

62
00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.960
Kendra's spirits.

63
00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:18.960
Let's share more tomorrow.

64
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:19.990
Sounds good though.

65
00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.990
Yeah.

66
00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.819
Pretty well.

67
00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:24.819
Smacktable.

68
00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:26.819
Let's go.

69
00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:33.129
Cora.

70
00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:34.129
Right?

71
00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:35.509
You must be mistaken.

72
00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:36.580
I'm Ashleen.

73
00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:37.580
I've been in France.

74
00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:38.580
I just got back.

75
00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:39.580
Twins.

76
00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.580
Yes, I've heard so much about the talented Miss Green skills and perfumory.

77
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.580
Josh, we are family after all.

78
00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.580
They got anything in?

79
00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:52.580
Chocolate.

80
00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:58.969
What's she doing here?

81
00:02:58.969 --> 00:03:02.599
What a coincidence.

82
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.199
Let's go say hello.

83
00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:10.199
Might as well.

84
00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:14.120
It's six o'clock.

85
00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.120
It's Josh and Ashley.

86
00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.120
Okay.

87
00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.349
Hey, big bro.

88
00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:27.349
So, if I'm not mistaken, Dad told you to stay home and rest.

89
00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:28.349
What are you doing out?

90
00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:30.349
Don't put too much pressure on yourself, Josh.

91
00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:34.349
It's not like Father has any expectations of you anyways.

92
00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:37.349
Little Sis, you haven't been home in days.

93
00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:38.349
No calls?

94
00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:41.419
We've all been worried sick about you.

95
00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:42.419
Worried about what?

96
00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:45.419
Of course, worried you wouldn't do a good job.

97
00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:48.419
After all, twins have that special connection.

98
00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:49.419
Yeah.

99
00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:50.509
Twins.

100
00:03:50.509 --> 00:04:04.319
It's almost like no one would notice if you replaced me as Tristan's wife.

101
00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:07.949
You should probably go.

102
00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:14.740
Yeah.

103
00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:23.839
Wait, wait, wait.

104
00:04:23.839 --> 00:04:25.029
I'm pursuing you anyway.

105
00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:28.339
Now it's really not the time.

106
00:04:28.339 --> 00:04:32.339
Unless you broke quality issues with your shoes.

107
00:04:32.339 --> 00:04:43.310
It says, in 10 feet, you're going to make a left.

108
00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:44.310
How's he?

109
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:45.310
Yeah, right?

110
00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:47.310
Is this the door?

111
00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:48.310
Okay.

112
00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.540
Yep.

113
00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.050
Anyways.

114
00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:02.779
Miss Green, there's a partnership that I wish to discuss with you.

115
00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:04.069
Interested?

116
00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:07.709
What kind of partnership did you have in mind?

117
00:05:07.709 --> 00:05:18.959
Why don't we take this upstairs?

118
00:05:18.959 --> 00:05:19.959
Eat up.

119
00:05:19.959 --> 00:05:22.959
I bet you're hungry after dealing with those two all night.

120
00:05:22.959 --> 00:05:26.529
You're right.

121
00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:27.720
Let's eat.

122
00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.189
You did well today.

123
00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:33.189
You seem to know a lot about perfume design.

124
00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:37.189
If only he knew half the perfume products in his house were my designs, he'd be shocked.

125
00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:39.189
I have some basic knowledge.

126
00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:41.379
You're not too fond of Ashley.

127
00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:44.410
How are you?

128
00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:45.410
What makes you say that?

129
00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:46.410
Just a feeling.

130
00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:48.980
It's none of your business.

131
00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:53.930
From now on.

132
00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:55.930
You'll continue to be my eyes.

133
00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:04.600
And I'll do my best to help you, too.

134
00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:05.600
Sounds good.

135
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.939
Yours is overcooked.

136
00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:11.029
How can you tell?

137
00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:12.029
I can hear it.

138
00:06:12.029 --> 00:06:14.540
Hear it.

139
00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:23.769
Hey, those are my utensils.

140
00:06:23.769 --> 00:06:24.990
I know.

141
00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:33.779
That tastes great.

142
00:06:33.779 --> 00:06:35.350
Weirdo.

143
00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:37.639
I meant this thing.

144
00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:38.639
Sure.

145
00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:42.370
Is your father in this room?

146
00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:51.310
Hey, you can't begin here.

147
00:06:51.310 --> 00:07:00.959
Quick, let's get him out of here.

148
00:07:00.959 --> 00:07:02.959
Stop being the machine's harm him.

149
00:07:02.959 --> 00:07:05.660
Nothing was even plugged in.

150
00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:09.430
Seems even my dad's illness was a conspiracy.

151
00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:11.430
What drug were they giving him?

152
00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:13.430
Okay, let's get the butt out first.

153
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:27.750
Yeah, I'm all right.

154
00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:31.939
Thank you for helping me with my dad's situation.

155
00:07:31.939 --> 00:07:35.040
On the screen, I should be thanking you instead.

156
00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:38.199
Tristan hasn't smiled ever since his accident.

157
00:07:38.199 --> 00:07:40.480
Accident?

158
00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:44.480
An accident that didn't seem so accidental.

159
00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:48.779
You also cite that day.

160
00:07:48.779 --> 00:07:50.519
Hello?

161
00:07:50.519 --> 00:07:53.519
Sir, the furniture you ordered is about to arrive.

162
00:07:53.519 --> 00:07:55.000
Okay.

163
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Take care of it for me.

164
00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000
No problem.

165
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:07.680
What's going on, sir?

166
00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:11.060
What do we do, sir?

167
00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:13.060
Sir, can you hear me, sir?

168
00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:15.060
What's going on, sir?

169
00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:17.060
Sir, sir.

170
00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:40.100
How did you get in?

171
00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:43.100
This is our family vacation home.

172
00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:45.100
Why wouldn't I be able to get in?

173
00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:48.710
Oh, I'm so sorry I forgot.

174
00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:49.710
You can't see.

175
00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:51.259
Oh, Josh.

176
00:08:51.259 --> 00:08:52.259
Wait.

177
00:08:52.259 --> 00:09:01.740
Are you still not adding sugar, huh?

178
00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:02.940
Get to the point.

179
00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:06.480
Hand over the company's black card access.

180
00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:10.169
Qualify it.

181
00:09:10.169 --> 00:09:18.490
Tristan, Dad already gave me the CEO position.

182
00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:20.870
Okay, you have nothing left.

183
00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:32.309
What are you doing here?

184
00:09:32.309 --> 00:09:33.309
What are you doing here?

185
00:09:33.309 --> 00:09:41.840
Before I lose my patience.

186
00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:47.250
Oh, well you're in this state and still trying to act tough?

187
00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:51.250
Tristan may be blind, but he's a genuine, honest man.

188
00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:54.279
You, however, have darkness in your heart,

189
00:09:54.279 --> 00:10:00.379
even standing in the sunlight.

190
00:10:00.379 --> 00:10:02.379
You're a mouthy little girl, aren't you?

191
00:10:02.379 --> 00:10:04.139
No.

192
00:10:04.139 --> 00:10:05.139
No.

193
00:10:05.139 --> 00:10:08.639
You know what?

194
00:10:08.639 --> 00:10:11.980
I'm done with you too.

195
00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:14.980
Oh, and Tristan, your air is over, buddy.

196
00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:24.039
Just how many surprises are you hiding, Cora?

197
00:10:24.039 --> 00:10:29.169
Tristan may be blind, but he's a genuine, honest man.

198
00:10:29.169 --> 00:10:37.179
Listen, you need to stick your neck out like that again, only by its trouble.

199
00:10:37.179 --> 00:10:45.759
Cora?

200
00:10:45.759 --> 00:11:45.580
It's a little bit longer.

201
00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:47.990
What?

202
00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:48.990
William is missing?

203
00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:56.429
How do you lose a man in a coma?

204
00:11:56.429 --> 00:11:58.429
Ashley, this has gone too far.

205
00:11:58.429 --> 00:11:59.429
We need to stop now.

206
00:11:59.429 --> 00:12:00.429
No.

207
00:12:00.429 --> 00:12:02.559
We can't give up the life we have now.

208
00:12:02.559 --> 00:12:08.029
But it must be Ashley.

209
00:12:08.029 --> 00:12:19.059
She has an accomplice now.

210
00:12:19.059 --> 00:12:20.059
What's up, dude?

211
00:12:20.059 --> 00:12:25.120
You mentioned needing new perfume products, and I just so happen to have some.

212
00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:28.250
Say, want to join forces?

213
00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:51.450
Tristan, we didn't do anything last night.

214
00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:52.450
Did we?

215
00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:55.759
What do you think?

216
00:12:55.759 --> 00:12:59.299
You didn't do anything to me, did you?

217
00:12:59.299 --> 00:13:02.299
You should be asking if you did something to me.

218
00:13:02.299 --> 00:13:13.259
Last night you fell on top of me, and you hugged me, and then you called me Daddy.

219
00:13:13.259 --> 00:13:15.950
You?

220
00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:20.710
You had me worried there.

221
00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:21.710
No worries.

222
00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:28.700
I can't really sleep anyway, so no harm done.

223
00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:33.100
Ashley, I have something for that.

224
00:13:33.100 --> 00:14:01.370
Wait here.

225
00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:02.399
What is it?

226
00:14:02.399 --> 00:14:04.399
It's something to help you sleep.

227
00:14:04.399 --> 00:14:13.539
But relax first.

228
00:14:13.539 --> 00:14:14.539
How is it?

229
00:14:14.539 --> 00:14:15.539
Do you feel anything?

230
00:14:15.539 --> 00:14:17.779
Wow.

231
00:14:17.779 --> 00:14:25.789
Do you hate it?

232
00:14:25.789 --> 00:14:28.620
I actually don't feel sleepy at all.

233
00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:33.779
I kind of feel hot all over like I want to take off my clothes.

234
00:14:33.779 --> 00:14:35.779
Why didn't you put in there?

235
00:14:35.779 --> 00:14:36.779
I didn't.

236
00:14:36.779 --> 00:14:49.840
I just used the scent of agarwood to the base and to help you fall asleep.

237
00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:50.840
That's the door.

238
00:14:50.840 --> 00:15:01.090
I'll go get it.

239
00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:03.720
Ashley.

240
00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:04.720
Cora.

241
00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:08.720
You haven't been home in such a long time, and we've missed you so much.

242
00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:12.549
Your sister and I decided to come see you.

243
00:15:12.549 --> 00:15:13.549
Come on in.

244
00:15:13.549 --> 00:15:23.769
How is it?

245
00:15:23.769 --> 00:15:25.830
Are you still living here?

246
00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:27.899
It's not bad.

247
00:15:27.899 --> 00:15:36.610
So, Ashley, they picked your father up from the hospital.

248
00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:37.610
What do you mean picked up?

249
00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:38.610
They took him.

250
00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:39.769
Who did it?

251
00:15:39.769 --> 00:15:40.990
I don't know.

252
00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:42.990
They were in disguise.

253
00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:46.379
It had to have been planned in advance.

254
00:15:46.379 --> 00:15:54.779
Where's Cora?

255
00:15:54.779 --> 00:15:56.809
Cora isn't feeling well.

256
00:15:56.809 --> 00:15:59.129
She would choose the bathroom.

257
00:15:59.129 --> 00:16:08.830
Hey, you.

258
00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:13.139
Where are you?

259
00:16:13.139 --> 00:16:17.779
I'll go find her.

260
00:16:17.779 --> 00:16:18.779
Stop my cake.

261
00:16:18.779 --> 00:16:26.029
I think I need to go home and lay down.

262
00:16:26.029 --> 00:16:28.159
Oh, honey.

263
00:16:28.159 --> 00:16:30.220
What's going on?

264
00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:34.299
Eyes with you need to leave.

265
00:16:34.299 --> 00:16:35.460
Mm-hmm.

266
00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:38.460
Let us know if you hear anything about your father.

267
00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:41.649
Take care of yourself.

268
00:16:41.649 --> 00:16:49.740
It says, what are you two up to?

269
00:16:49.740 --> 00:17:10.450
Green Spice New Product Preview.

270
00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:12.450
Where's Cora?

271
00:17:12.450 --> 00:17:14.450
Cora wasn't feeling well.

272
00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:17.250
She would choose the bathroom.

273
00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:19.250
She must have stolen it.

274
00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:26.319
Cora, this new product is Ashley.

275
00:17:26.319 --> 00:17:28.220
Hello, everyone.

276
00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:30.759
I'm lying, stealing bitch.

277
00:17:30.759 --> 00:17:32.759
I won't let you get away with this.

278
00:17:32.759 --> 00:17:38.400
They're going to start.

279
00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:39.400
You can't hear it.

280
00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:41.589
It's me.

281
00:17:41.589 --> 00:17:42.589
Who are you?

282
00:17:42.589 --> 00:17:45.589
I'm Cora Green of Green Spice.

283
00:17:46.589 --> 00:17:47.720
May I go in?

284
00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:48.720
No.

285
00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:51.200
The lady has ordered you to not go in.

286
00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:54.059
What?

287
00:17:54.059 --> 00:17:58.509
Oh, everyone.

288
00:17:58.509 --> 00:18:01.509
I'm happy to formally introduce my upcoming perfume series.

289
00:18:01.509 --> 00:18:09.250
In my hand, I hold a sample of the main product, Unending Love.

290
00:18:09.250 --> 00:18:13.279
If you look under your water glasses, you'll each find a perfume test strip.

291
00:18:13.279 --> 00:18:14.279
Yes, that's right.

292
00:18:14.279 --> 00:18:16.339
Snippin' up.

293
00:18:16.339 --> 00:18:23.869
The concept of this scent comes from Tacor's poem, Endless Love.

294
00:18:23.869 --> 00:18:31.869
This time, of course, the raw materials are still developed using lilacs from Green Spice's mountains, using the traditional immersion extraction methods.

295
00:18:31.869 --> 00:18:34.869
This is a work that returns Green Spice to its original intention.

296
00:18:34.869 --> 00:18:45.579
I'm gonna be so similar.

297
00:18:45.579 --> 00:18:49.599
But it's obviously not developed by Green Spice.

298
00:18:49.599 --> 00:18:52.180
It's a different technique.

299
00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:58.180
This series includes scented candles and a full set of back products.

300
00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:00.940
Well, thank you, Miss Ashley.

301
00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:01.940
It should just be great.

302
00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:03.940
We have time for some questions.

303
00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:22.809
I think it's dislocated.

304
00:19:22.809 --> 00:19:23.970
What should I do?

305
00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:27.089
I'm really touching it.

306
00:19:27.089 --> 00:19:29.309
She told us to keep her out of the event.

307
00:19:29.309 --> 00:19:30.309
Throw her into a wall.

308
00:19:30.309 --> 00:19:38.309
You said that the lilac flower in this scent was extracted by Green Spice using normal immersion technologies, correct?

309
00:19:38.309 --> 00:19:39.309
Exactly.

310
00:19:39.309 --> 00:19:45.309
It just so happens that this scent utilizes a natural extraction method using carbon dioxide.

311
00:19:45.309 --> 00:19:51.019
Then I may have.

312
00:19:51.019 --> 00:20:00.259
You might also know that industrial technology has advanced and the extraction method.

313
00:20:00.259 --> 00:20:04.259
As far as I know, this technology's extraction yield is very low.

314
00:20:04.259 --> 00:20:08.259
One that a big company like Green Spice would never use.

315
00:20:08.259 --> 00:20:17.769
And it just so happens that a famous independent perfumer pioneered this technology for natural extraction, Victoria.

316
00:20:17.769 --> 00:20:25.740
And this is entirely her work.

317
00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:26.740
Oh my god.

318
00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:28.740
Did you copy another designer?

319
00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:29.740
This is not your work.

320
00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:30.740
And you.

321
00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:32.799
A not a perfumer.

322
00:20:32.799 --> 00:20:36.900
And you.

323
00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:38.900
A not a perfumer.

324
00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:43.980
Miss Green, is this true?

325
00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:44.980
Did you steal someone's design?

326
00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:47.980
I heard you studied perfumer abroad.

327
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:50.980
How are you not able to distinguish extraction method?

328
00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:52.980
You're not going to answer my question.

329
00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:55.980
After all we've been through it seriously?

330
00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:57.980
I mean, what is your temper?

331
00:20:57.980 --> 00:20:59.460
What is your degree?

332
00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:01.460
It doesn't make any sense.

333
00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:03.660
How did you know she was lying?

334
00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:08.009
As you know I'm quite familiar with her work.

335
00:21:08.009 --> 00:21:09.390
Who?

336
00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:17.269
Let's go.

337
00:21:17.269 --> 00:21:19.269
Thank God you saw through her today.

338
00:21:19.269 --> 00:21:22.299
We sliced up this significant loss.

339
00:21:22.299 --> 00:21:23.299
Cheers.

340
00:21:23.299 --> 00:21:26.660
Mrs. Hamilton, why?

341
00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:27.660
No, thank you.

342
00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:29.660
I'm allergic to alcohol.

343
00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:36.009
I'll drink for her.

344
00:21:36.009 --> 00:21:37.009
Easy?

345
00:21:37.009 --> 00:21:38.009
Careful.

346
00:21:38.009 --> 00:21:39.009
Couch?

347
00:21:39.009 --> 00:21:40.009
Couch?

348
00:21:40.009 --> 00:21:42.859
Oh.

349
00:21:42.859 --> 00:21:46.819
Oh, it's your tolerance drinking for tea was a bad idea.

350
00:21:46.819 --> 00:21:48.819
Sorry I'm not sorry.

351
00:21:48.819 --> 00:21:56.049
I'm just going to wait here a while.

352
00:21:56.049 --> 00:21:57.049
Sleep tight.

353
00:21:57.049 --> 00:22:25.819
I need some water.

354
00:22:25.819 --> 00:22:32.589
Whatever, he can't see anyway.

355
00:22:32.589 --> 00:22:35.349
Here you go.

356
00:22:35.349 --> 00:22:51.819
What is that?

357
00:22:51.819 --> 00:22:52.819
And I dreamy.

358
00:22:52.819 --> 00:22:54.849
You shouldn't drink so much.

359
00:22:54.849 --> 00:23:00.109
It's not good for you.

360
00:23:00.109 --> 00:23:31.900
Hey, what are you doing?

361
00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:32.900
In your hand.

362
00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:35.660
This is real.

363
00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:37.950
You're drunk.

364
00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:54.130
Besides, I could see a second ago.

365
00:23:54.130 --> 00:23:58.210
It's my vision coming back.

366
00:23:58.210 --> 00:24:03.700
I heard that Tristan finalized the LC contract.

367
00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:04.700
Yes.

368
00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:11.660
It seems like he really put in a lot of effort.

369
00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:14.660
And it seems Josh is still falling behind.

370
00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:32.329
So, are you still thinking about the press conference?

371
00:24:32.329 --> 00:24:36.059
Tristan has already chosen his side.

372
00:24:36.059 --> 00:24:39.380
He and Ash, Cora.

373
00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:42.890
It's not easy to deal with.

374
00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:43.890
Blind man.

375
00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:47.880
A useless second lady.

376
00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:49.880
What's there to be afraid about?

377
00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:53.009
If Cora has become Tristan's eyes,

378
00:24:53.009 --> 00:24:55.039
get rid of her.

379
00:24:55.039 --> 00:24:56.039
Don't worry.

380
00:24:56.039 --> 00:24:58.460
I have a plan.

381
00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:11.630
Is there a reason Ms. Green didn't come with you today, sir?

382
00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:13.630
She's actually at home right now.

383
00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:14.630
Cooking me dinner.

384
00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:16.589
Cooking.

385
00:25:16.589 --> 00:25:17.819
For you.

386
00:25:17.819 --> 00:25:19.910
Ha ha ha.

387
00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:24.480
Calm down.

388
00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:27.660
Get back to business.

389
00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:30.690
What time is it?

390
00:25:30.690 --> 00:25:34.390
Five minutes past signing time, sir.

391
00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:36.650
Excuse me.

392
00:25:36.650 --> 00:25:38.650
We have an appointment with President.

393
00:25:38.650 --> 00:25:40.650
We're supposed to be signing a contract.

394
00:25:40.650 --> 00:25:42.650
Today's signing ceremony was canceled.

395
00:25:42.650 --> 00:25:43.650
Cancel.

396
00:25:43.650 --> 00:25:45.650
Your wife Ms. Cora already came by.

397
00:25:45.650 --> 00:25:47.650
She said he wanted to transfer the rights of the contract

398
00:25:47.650 --> 00:25:49.650
over to your brother, Josh.

399
00:25:49.650 --> 00:25:51.289
Wait, wait.

400
00:25:51.289 --> 00:26:04.299
Congratulations on your signing.

401
00:26:04.299 --> 00:26:06.299
Is there something you want to tell me?

402
00:26:06.299 --> 00:26:09.299
You are awesome.

403
00:26:09.299 --> 00:26:20.059
It's suspicious much.

404
00:26:20.059 --> 00:26:23.480
Cora, I've almost finished talking to Elsie.

405
00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:25.480
How are things in your end?

406
00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:26.480
What are you talking about?

407
00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:28.480
Did Tristan give you a hard time?

408
00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:29.480
Did Tristan what?

409
00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:34.710
What's going on?

410
00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:35.710
You should know.

411
00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:38.130
What happened?

412
00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:41.130
How long have you been colluding with Josh?

413
00:26:41.130 --> 00:26:43.609
Colluding with Josh.

414
00:26:43.609 --> 00:26:44.609
What do you mean?

415
00:26:44.609 --> 00:26:47.309
Today I'm into Elsie Group.

416
00:26:47.309 --> 00:26:50.759
And they told me that you were there yesterday.

417
00:26:50.759 --> 00:26:53.759
And that you transferred the contract over to Josh.

418
00:26:53.759 --> 00:26:57.490
Tell me it isn't true.

419
00:26:57.490 --> 00:27:00.289
That's impossible.

420
00:27:00.289 --> 00:27:02.289
I was home all day yesterday.

421
00:27:02.289 --> 00:27:04.289
I don't like it when people lie to me.

422
00:27:04.289 --> 00:27:08.400
Don't you believe me at all?

423
00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:12.450
Tristan, you paranoid dumbass.

424
00:27:12.450 --> 00:27:22.099
Bear, I said it.

425
00:27:22.099 --> 00:27:24.099
Tristan, you paranoid dumbass.

426
00:27:24.099 --> 00:27:32.180
Bear, I said it.

427
00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:34.180
Siri, call Mark.

428
00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:36.359
Hello, sir.

429
00:27:36.359 --> 00:27:39.359
I need you to check the surveillance footage from yesterday.

430
00:27:39.359 --> 00:27:40.359
I need to know if Cora went out.

431
00:27:40.359 --> 00:27:41.359
Okay.

432
00:27:41.359 --> 00:27:42.359
I'll check it right away.

433
00:27:42.359 --> 00:27:44.359
Don't let me down.

434
00:27:44.359 --> 00:27:54.039
I didn't go out yesterday.

435
00:27:54.039 --> 00:27:56.359
I definitely wasn't there.

436
00:27:56.359 --> 00:27:59.480
They said they saw me.

437
00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:01.119
Saw.

438
00:28:01.119 --> 00:28:08.559
It must be Cora.

439
00:28:08.559 --> 00:28:09.559
I checked the surveillance, sir.

440
00:28:09.559 --> 00:28:11.559
Miss Green didn't go out yesterday.

441
00:28:11.559 --> 00:28:13.230
Okay.

442
00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:14.230
I see.

443
00:28:14.230 --> 00:28:19.089
See what you can find on Cora's twin sister, Ashley.

444
00:28:19.089 --> 00:28:22.380
I need to know what's going on between them.

445
00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:23.380
Copy that.
