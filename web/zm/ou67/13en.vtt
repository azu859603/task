00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.879
Oh, I heard that Mr. Kerry was here.

2
00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:08.640
I hope I'm not interrupting.

3
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.519
Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton, what are you doing here?

4
00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.519
We're actually in the middle of a meeting right now.

5
00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:15.400
It's rude to interrupt.

6
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.320
Well, see, he's always had the highest standards.

7
00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.000
Mr. Kerry, and you've always been interested in my work.

8
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.339
New project?

9
00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:27.660
An original collection by the one and only Victoria.

10
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.660
How does he have that?

11
00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:37.869
Like die a hard fan?

12
00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:41.200
There's concepts to advance for the current market.

13
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.520
And, uh, males' fragrances.

14
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.320
It's just you risky.

15
00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.119
And the concept is advanced, yes,

16
00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:50.479
but statistics show that it's consistent with current trends.

17
00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:58.780
Once it's released, scent of a man is sure to be ahead.

18
00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.780
Does it smell like money?

19
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.299
I'm intrigued.

20
00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:06.780
This project's from five years ago.

21
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.000
I must meet the perfumer.

22
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.840
It's in a manner of woman.

23
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.120
Nobody knows Victoria's true identity.

24
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.219
But money does talk.

25
00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:25.250
Mr. Kerry, shouldn't we stick to the original project?

26
00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:34.609
I need to reconsider that contract.

27
00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:37.409
Make sure he knows I'm giving him the bird, all right?
