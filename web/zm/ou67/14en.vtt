1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Before the Jews.

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I won, before.

3
00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.060
We like that kind of thing.

4
00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.669
It was just on.

5
00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:17.670
It's not the same to me.

6
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:24.949
Well, it's a big, handsome man just rescued the poor, it was dame.

7
00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:28.500
Now he's hovering ever so closely at a room.

8
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.980
And there it is.

9
00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:31.980
The kiss.

10
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:42.409
So do you know if Victoria is a man or a woman?

11
00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:45.109
How can you be so sure?

12
00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:47.109
Because no man could create this cent.

13
00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:51.140
But Victoria's first work was immense fragrance.

14
00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.140
What makes you think it's a woman?

15
00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.140
Not.

16
00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.530
Victoria must be a woman.

17
00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.710
So do you like her?

18
00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.829
No.

19
00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.630
Are you jealous?

20
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.629
Of course not.

21
00:01:05.629 --> 00:01:12.989
Your cent is very similar to Victoria's signature cent.

22
00:01:12.989 --> 00:01:14.989
It's just a little different.

23
00:01:14.989 --> 00:01:17.819
I'm a master perfumer.

24
00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:21.049
So I know if there's something like this on the market.

25
00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:25.819
Victoria.
