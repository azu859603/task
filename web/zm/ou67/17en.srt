1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:10,339
Oh, God.

2
00:00:10,339 --> 00:00:28,089
Maybe there's power?

3
00:00:28,089 --> 00:00:29,089
Mm-hmm.

4
00:00:29,089 --> 00:00:31,239
It's okay.

5
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:32,240
I'm here.

6
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,240
Where are your circuit breakers?

7
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,240
Downstairs here.

8
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,240
I'll show you.

9
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:41,469
My battery died.

10
00:00:41,469 --> 00:00:42,469
It's okay.

11
00:00:42,469 --> 00:00:43,469
Take my hand.

12
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:45,950
I don't guide you.

13
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:48,179
I should know my way around this place by now.

14
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:51,939
This isn't so bad.

15
00:00:51,939 --> 00:00:54,380
I kind of like this power outage.

16
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:55,670
Why?

17
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:58,570
And we're both on this and you both.

18
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:01,460
But I'm afraid of the dark.

19
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:15,500
Here we go.

20
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,500
Here we are.

21
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:28,790
I'm using which one did I press?
