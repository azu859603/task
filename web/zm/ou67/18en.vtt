00:00:05.389 --> 00:00:26.989
I found it.

2
00:00:26.989 --> 00:01:02.329
You're really falling for him, but he thinks I'm Cora.

3
00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:04.480
Do you mind?

4
00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:05.480
I got you.

5
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.769
Bend down a little.

6
00:01:06.769 --> 00:01:13.299
I missed one.

7
00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:15.299
Did I mess up a button?

8
00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.299
Just one.

9
00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:17.299
Thank you.

10
00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:18.459
You're welcome.

11
00:01:18.459 --> 00:01:26.180
It's a company meeting later today and I was wondering if you'd want to come with me.

12
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.469
Why should I come to the meeting?

13
00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:36.500
You're part of the family now, right?

14
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:49.609
Then I should probably get changed.

15
00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:51.609
Am I supposed to change with you standing here?

16
00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:54.819
Remember.

17
00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:56.879
At least turn around.

18
00:01:56.879 --> 00:01:57.909
Turn around.

19
00:01:57.909 --> 00:01:59.909
Just in other way.

20
00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:11.819
Well, I have a special announcement for the past two years.

21
00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:19.849
Tristan has successfully managed both the New York and Los Angeles branches and achieve some of the highest sales in our history.

22
00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:23.849
So for that reason, I'm returning him to headquarters as the new CEO.

23
00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:27.849
His working relationship with the LC group has elevated our company image.

24
00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:31.849
Tristan's ability is evident to everyone. I have no objection.

25
00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:33.099
Thank you.

26
00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:34.229
Everyone.

27
00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:36.229
I have an objection.
