1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,419
I have an objection.

2
00:00:06,419 --> 00:00:08,640
Father?

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,820
Gentlemen.

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:15,980
Tristan has been secretly meeting with outsiders

5
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:19,129
to sell our company shares.

6
00:00:19,129 --> 00:00:22,329
I mean, someone like that shouldn't even be in the company.

7
00:00:22,329 --> 00:00:23,649
Let alone running it.

8
00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:25,570
Just stop this nonsense.

9
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,289
No, Ted.

10
00:00:27,289 --> 00:00:36,840
But for yourself, all the evidence is right here.

11
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:44,899
Signature there, there, and there.

12
00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:46,659
Tristan, what's the meaning of this?

13
00:00:46,659 --> 00:00:48,460
I don't know anything about this.

14
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:50,140
I was never informed of these documents,

15
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,979
and I would never sign anything like that.

16
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:54,460
Looks like your signature.

17
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:57,539
Going behind the company's back to sell shares, I mean.

18
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:06,430
This could lead to the media and seriously harder reputation.

19
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:09,480
Mr. Hamilton, I think you should make a conclusion

20
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:13,590
after a thorough investigation.

21
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,180
You're right.

22
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,140
We will conduct a thorough investigation.

23
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:22,569
And until this matters resolved,

24
00:01:22,569 --> 00:01:38,959
Tristan will be suspended from all company duties.

25
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:40,480
This is defamation.

26
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,200
Why don't you just explain?

27
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,879
Yes, it doesn't matter if it's true or false.

28
00:01:44,879 --> 00:02:01,099
But come on, let's go home.

29
00:02:01,099 --> 00:02:02,579
What's going on?
