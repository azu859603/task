00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
What's going on?

2
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.320
Didn't you say there was going to be an investigation?

3
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.320
Why did Josh throw out all your things? He can't do this.

4
00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.060
What's happening?

5
00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:16.250
They're throwing us out.

6
00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:45.189
You could stay here for now.

7
00:00:45.189 --> 00:00:48.740
This investigation might take a while, Mark.

8
00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.409
Stay as long as you need.

9
00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:55.409
I know it's not as nice as you're used to.

10
00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:58.409
No, it's perfect. We're just happy to have someone to stay.

11
00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:01.409
Well, I'm sure you're hungry.

12
00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:03.750
I'll cook.

13
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:04.750
Great.

14
00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.819
I'll go out, get us some supplies.

15
00:01:06.819 --> 00:01:08.819
Boss, right here.

16
00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:10.819
Come aboard.

17
00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:12.819
Sit right there.

18
00:01:12.819 --> 00:01:15.140
Make yourselves comfortable.

19
00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:24.049
What happened to your end?

20
00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:25.049
I burned my hand.

21
00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.049
Here.

22
00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:34.989
Why are you laughing?

23
00:01:34.989 --> 00:01:38.280
It's the other hand, silly.

24
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.140
I'm comfortable here.

25
00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:58.299
I can take you home.

26
00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:03.959
Do you feel I think you're a burden?

27
00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:16.099
I actually kind of like you.
