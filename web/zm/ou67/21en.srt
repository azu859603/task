1
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:07,889
If the lights weren't being so weird, I wouldn't have lit so many candles.

2
00:00:07,889 --> 00:00:11,619
You don't think I'm being wasteful, do you?

3
00:00:11,619 --> 00:00:12,880
Oh, she's not.

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,420
And a little scaredy cat is afraid of the dark.

5
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:21,629
So what are you going to do next?

6
00:00:21,629 --> 00:00:27,539
Do you have a way to deal with Josh?

7
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:31,640
Even if I had a way to take Josh down, it wouldn't make me happy.

8
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,740
He's my baby brother.

9
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:37,700
I feel like we've both just been pawns

10
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,700
and my father's schemes for the business.

11
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,920
Forget about your family.

12
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:47,100
What do you want?

13
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,899
Well, I thought I wanted to become the top perfume company in the world,

14
00:00:50,899 --> 00:00:56,549
but I feel like that was my father's dream.

15
00:00:56,549 --> 00:01:01,850
And not mine at all.

16
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:05,849
When I was five years old, my mother taught me how to make my first perfume.

17
00:01:05,849 --> 00:01:08,040
I called it Miss B.

18
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,549
I don't know if it was my mother that pushed me to be a perfumer,

19
00:01:12,549 --> 00:01:16,549
but all I know is I truly do love it.

20
00:01:16,549 --> 00:01:18,840
You'll find that too.

21
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:27,500
You just need time to discover your own path away from your family.

22
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:46,939
Well, luckily I am some time, and luckily I have you too.

23
00:01:46,939 --> 00:01:52,840
If.

24
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,030
If what?
