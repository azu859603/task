00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:09,509
Hey, Doc, can you tell me, is there any chance that my eyes will fully recover?

2
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:16,600
Your test results show signs of improvement, but what they can fully recover would depend

3
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,679
on many factors.

4
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:19,719
Okay, thank you.

5
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:45,039
Did you do all this?

6
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:46,619
Could you see it?

7
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:48,460
I'm a breakfast machine.

8
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:49,460
What can I say?

9
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:52,170
But what if you hurt yourself?

10
00:00:52,170 --> 00:01:02,310
I just wanted to make breakfast for you.

11
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:05,719
Hm, it's delicious.

12
00:01:05,719 --> 00:01:06,719
Really?

13
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:08,939
Hm?

14
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:11,730
Try it.

15
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:12,920
Oh!

16
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,560
What are you, a puppy?

17
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,560
Yours.

18
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,560
What?

19
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,650
I'm going to finish getting ready.

20
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:27,299
The screen.

21
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:31,790
Don't worry, boss.

22
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:32,790
I didn't see anything.

23
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:34,189
I know you saw everything.

24
00:01:34,189 --> 00:01:35,510
Mark.

25
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:36,510
How do you know?

26
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:38,870
Because I can see.
