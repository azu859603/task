00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.160
Now that we have evidence, why don't we just call the police?

2
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.980
No, it's not the right time yet.

3
00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:11.980
He needs to know that he's been manipulated.

4
00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.220
He has been for years.

5
00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:34.840
So I've been following up on the recent orders for this month,

6
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.840
and I kind of say it's not bad.

7
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:49.640
Tristan, what are you doing here?

8
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.640
Yeah, me and Dad are actually having a conversation right now, so can this wait?

9
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.640
You're always so anxious to get me out of the room.

10
00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.700
Are you hiding something?

11
00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:11.379
The hell are you talking about?

12
00:01:11.379 --> 00:01:14.510
It was you who caused the car accident.

13
00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.150
You who got me kicked out of the company.

14
00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.760
I'm blind because of you.

15
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.060
You've always fought for father's attention.

16
00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.989
Always followed his rules.

17
00:01:28.989 --> 00:01:36.189
Josh, you told me I've done the gas and run them all, which is just let me go.

18
00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:40.250
Well, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

19
00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.379
The automobile accident.

20
00:01:42.379 --> 00:01:43.379
You did it?

21
00:01:43.379 --> 00:01:53.700
For my whole life, all you ever gave a shit about was who I could become for you.

22
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.780
Don't blame me for this.

23
00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.939
You bastard!

24
00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:01.939
Be your brother!

25
00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:06.030
If I let you compete, you were never supposed to hurt each other.
