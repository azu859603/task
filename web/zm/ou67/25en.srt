1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I let you compete. You were never supposed to hurt each other.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,500
No. He's right.

3
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:06,030
This is your fault.

4
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:09,099
All you ever cared about is this company.

5
00:00:09,099 --> 00:00:12,099
Nothing else you compare, not even your own sons.

6
00:00:12,099 --> 00:00:14,480
You were gonna let us fight it out,

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,539
and see who could become the better tool.

8
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:19,699
Tool?

9
00:00:19,699 --> 00:00:22,239
How can you say that?

10
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:23,239
On my own.

11
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:26,269
I always trained you to take my place.

12
00:00:26,269 --> 00:00:33,240
Tristan was always your replacement.

13
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,710
Why not me?

14
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:41,850
How can you compare yourself to Tristan?

15
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,100
You've never done anything that satisfied me.

16
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,100
Then why did you let me compete?

17
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,679
Huh?

18
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:52,990
Why did you encourage me?

19
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:57,280
You always told us that you would treat us the same, right?

20
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,280
You gave me hope, time and time again.

21
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:07,060
And you denied me again and again.

22
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,060
But I get it now.

23
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:12,760
I was just a tool to sharpen Tristan.

24
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,760
You used me to train him.

25
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,760
Bullshit.

26
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,760
You'll still refuse to admit your mistakes.

27
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,760
Your mind is twisted.

28
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,760
You wanted us to compete, right, Father?

29
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,049
So let's go.

30
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:26,049
Right now.

31
00:01:26,049 --> 00:01:28,049
I'm gonna show you who the real man is.

32
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:29,079
Come on.

33
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:31,079
Let's go.

34
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:32,079
Come on.

35
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,079
Stop it.

36
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:34,079
Josh.

37
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,079
Stop.

38
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:37,079
That's enough.
