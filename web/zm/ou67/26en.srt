00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Tristan! Tristan!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Tristan!

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:36,490
You should go home.

4
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:40,490
Besides, Mr. Hamilton's eyes have recovered well in our treatment.

5
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:41,490
Thank you, doctor.

6
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:50,719
Mark, how is he?

7
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,719
His screen rests assured he's stable. He just needs rest.

8
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:00,299
By the way, the doctor said they detected nerve activity in his eyes.

9
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:02,299
He should be able to see scene.

10
00:01:02,299 --> 00:01:11,810
Really? Mark, you've been working hard. You should go home and rest.

11
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:13,810
Oh, no, no. I can stay. I can...

12
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:28,189
It's fine. Thank you.

13
00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:32,540
Tristan, one more you wake up.

14
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:37,260
Maybe when you wake up, you can see me.

15
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:43,469
If you can wake up, I'll tell you the truth.

16
00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:45,469
I want to be with you as the real me.

17
00:01:45,469 --> 00:01:47,920
That's Ashley.
