1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:09,330
Quora, something happened.

2
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:10,330
I know.

3
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:11,330
Josh blew it.

4
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:13,330
Tristan's vision is returning.

5
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:18,269
What?

6
00:00:18,269 --> 00:00:20,750
Now Josh is useless.

7
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:23,750
Who knew Blind Tristan would put up such a good fight?

8
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:26,420
Quora, what should I do?

9
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:32,170
No worries.

10
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:34,170
Tristan was never our enemy.

11
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:37,780
After all, isn't he still Quora's husband?

12
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:39,869
My husband?

13
00:00:39,869 --> 00:00:42,869
You mean, let Ashley come back?

14
00:00:42,869 --> 00:00:46,450
How can I let Ashley come back?

15
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:49,670
I want her to disappear from Tristan's side completely.

16
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:56,859
That way when Tristan wakes up, the first person he sees is me.

17
00:00:56,859 --> 00:01:01,060
The real Quora.

18
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:03,060
I'm the one who's been by his side.

19
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,060
I'm the one in love with him.

20
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:07,060
Quora, can't we just stop this?

21
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,060
Now you want to be a good mother?

22
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:09,060
No.

23
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,060
No, we're in too deep.

24
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:12,060
She's also my daughter.

25
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,060
Your sister.

26
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:16,670
What would you have us do?

27
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:20,060
Sister, she took everything from me.

28
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,060
And you.

29
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,920
I will take everything from her.

30
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:32,420
Hurry up.

31
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:33,420
We gotta go.

32
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:47,060
Perfect fit.

33
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:55,260
Tristan, Tristan.
