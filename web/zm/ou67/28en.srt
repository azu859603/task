1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,820
Is anyone there?

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:18,260
I'm going to shut your mouth.

3
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:23,070
I will shut it for you.

4
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:24,070
You.

5
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:25,070
Who are you?

6
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:28,480
What do you want?

7
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,480
Listen, you don't want to go down this road.

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,480
Do you?

9
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,479
Go to jail?

10
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:33,479
I have money.

11
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:35,479
You guys look like you like money.

12
00:00:35,479 --> 00:00:36,479
Don't come here.

13
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:37,479
Please.

14
00:00:37,479 --> 00:00:44,500
Please help!

15
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,500
Who are you?

16
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,500
Who sent you?

17
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,909
It's...

18
00:00:47,909 --> 00:00:48,909
What do you go cheeseburger?

19
00:00:48,909 --> 00:00:51,619
No cheese.

20
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:54,619
We ate the fries.

21
00:00:54,619 --> 00:00:56,619
Can we stay here quietly for a month?

22
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:05,900
All the water shrines will run away.

23
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:06,900
Alright?

24
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:20,739
Come and save me, please.

25
00:01:20,739 --> 00:01:30,829
Miss Green hasn't been home in a few days.

26
00:01:30,829 --> 00:01:32,989
It's not normal.

27
00:01:32,989 --> 00:01:38,819
Miss Green?
