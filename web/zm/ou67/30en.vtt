00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:19.850
Why does this feel wrong I still feel dizzy. I need to lay down. I'll get you a glass of water

2
00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:27.589
Thanks

3
00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:29.589
Everything is going according to plan

4
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.740
I just have one more thing to do. Cora

5
00:00:34.259 --> 00:00:37.070
Cora

6
00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.420
Yes, my love I made you a cake to celebrate your recovery

7
00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.670
Thank you

8
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.560
Why is it so dark in here? Aren't you afraid of the dark?

9
00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:56.490
I'm not that delicate

10
00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.619
Come on try some

11
00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.140
Thanks

12
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:19.299
Cheers

13
00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:29.760
Let's do this another day. I have a big meeting tomorrow. I'll see you in the morning

14
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:49.500
Okay, I wonder how he's doing. He should be awake

15
00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.579
Will he look for me? Will he even know where to find me?

16
00:01:53.939 --> 00:02:07.700
When he has decided to participate in international perfumery competition with green spice

17
00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:14.500
We call it more is to participate. So this is your plan to steal my life

18
00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.300
Although I will say we have a registration process that is closing a very

19
00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:56.159
What are you doing? I'm old place in golf and drink. I'll leave the company's affairs to you

20
00:02:56.479 --> 00:03:27.020
Don't worry dad. I can handle it Josh decided to turn himself in

21
00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:39.720
She's alive and well, no worry. I'll be right back. Don't play any tricks

22
00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:43.079
Maybe we'll get some cheese

23
00:04:45.079 --> 00:04:50.139
Cheese

24
00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:50.870
By her that worked it was a stupid one now

25
00:05:51.069 --> 00:07:04.319
Even if I can't prove my identity will he believe it when I was five years old my mother told me how to make my first perfume

26
00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:09.579
I called it miss v. I don't know if

27
00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:14.209
It's him. He knows.

28
00:07:14.209 --> 00:07:28.379
I want to register.

29
00:07:28.379 --> 00:07:30.379
Sorry. We're closed. Wait a minute.

30
00:07:30.379 --> 00:07:35.019
I know this doesn't mean anything to you.

31
00:07:35.019 --> 00:07:37.019
But this means everything to me.

32
00:07:37.019 --> 00:07:56.850
Please. Have you found her yet?

33
00:07:56.850 --> 00:07:59.839
No. These are our expertise, Madam.

34
00:07:59.839 --> 00:08:00.839
Fresh.

35
00:08:00.839 --> 00:08:04.860
They're basically asses to just lock her up.

36
00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:07.339
What?

37
00:08:07.339 --> 00:08:09.750
That's why I untied her.

38
00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:14.660
I guess I have to do everything myself.

39
00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:24.319
Are you ready? Do you mind?

40
00:08:24.319 --> 00:08:33.549
You seem nervous.

41
00:08:33.549 --> 00:08:36.669
Really? Maybe I'm just excited.

42
00:08:36.669 --> 00:08:42.870
We are attending the awards ceremony after all.

43
00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:43.870
Let's go.

44
00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:51.620
Ladies and gentlemen, after a month of fierce competition,

45
00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:56.409
the GSD has found its winner.

46
00:08:56.409 --> 00:08:57.409
It's Victoria!

47
00:08:57.409 --> 00:09:08.600
We now invite her to the stage to accept her award.

48
00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:13.529
This is some mysterious, independent perfume or Victorian.

49
00:09:13.529 --> 00:09:16.139
You should know, shouldn't you?

50
00:09:16.139 --> 00:09:19.139
Really? I want to know who it is.

51
00:09:19.139 --> 00:09:33.710
Who is that on the stage?

52
00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:36.450
Isn't this Kora?

53
00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:38.450
No, Kora is sitting in the audience.

54
00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:41.019
Sit down.

55
00:09:41.019 --> 00:09:52.370
I believe someone has recognized me.

56
00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:55.370
Yes, I have many identities.

57
00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:57.370
You may be familiar with Victoria,

58
00:09:57.370 --> 00:10:01.009
but you can also call me by my real name.

59
00:10:01.009 --> 00:10:02.009
Ashley Green.

60
00:10:02.009 --> 00:10:09.799
No matter what name I go by,

61
00:10:09.799 --> 00:10:13.629
honesty is the most important thing.

62
00:10:13.629 --> 00:10:16.629
I stand here today because someone plagiarized my work

63
00:10:16.629 --> 00:10:20.139
and tried to steal my life.

64
00:10:20.139 --> 00:10:27.450
I will not let her succeed.

65
00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:28.450
Ladies and gentlemen,

66
00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:32.450
it seems the president will present the awarder.

67
00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:36.620
Long time no see.

68
00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:45.620
Time's up.

69
00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:48.039
Give me back my life, bitch thief.

70
00:10:48.039 --> 00:10:51.539
It's not what it looks like.

71
00:10:51.539 --> 00:10:54.700
You have to believe me, Tristan. Tristan!

72
00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:57.700
You have to believe me, Tristan. Tristan!

73
00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:00.789
Kora replaced Ashley.

74
00:11:00.789 --> 00:11:03.789
Tristan, I was the one who was with you by your side when you woke up.

75
00:11:03.789 --> 00:11:04.789
I made you a cake!

76
00:11:04.789 --> 00:11:07.399
How do you not believe me?

77
00:11:07.399 --> 00:11:09.399
Ms. Kora's saving for the police.

78
00:11:09.399 --> 00:11:10.399
Come on.

79
00:11:10.399 --> 00:11:11.399
Let go of me. Let go of me!

80
00:11:11.399 --> 00:11:15.639
When I opened my eyes,

81
00:11:15.639 --> 00:11:18.919
I know she wasn't you.

82
00:11:18.919 --> 00:11:22.929
You okay?

83
00:11:22.929 --> 00:11:23.929
I burned my hand.

84
00:11:23.929 --> 00:11:27.139
Why are you laughing?

85
00:11:27.139 --> 00:11:28.649
It's the other hand.

86
00:11:28.649 --> 00:11:32.500
Does this feel wrong?

87
00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:48.330
You're a liar. Get her out of here.

88
00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:59.629
What are you looking at?

89
00:11:59.629 --> 00:12:03.100
She wasn't afraid of the dark.

90
00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:06.289
She didn't have any burn marks on her hands.

91
00:12:06.289 --> 00:12:08.350
I want to hurt about your twin.

92
00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:10.350
I have my suspicions.

93
00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:15.240
She was saying that she pretended to be you

94
00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:17.240
and then went to see Louis Carey.

95
00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:18.240
Yes.

96
00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:20.240
This is just her usual dirty trick.

97
00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:23.360
You two switch places often,

98
00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:32.529
or is this something that you did as kids?

99
00:12:32.529 --> 00:12:33.529
Okay.

100
00:12:33.529 --> 00:12:37.490
See what you can find on Kora's twin sister, Ashley.

101
00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:41.059
I need to know what's going on between them.

102
00:12:41.059 --> 00:12:43.740
You knew everything.

103
00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:44.740
Not everything.

104
00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:48.179
I didn't know where you were.

105
00:12:48.179 --> 00:12:51.740
That's why I took a chance.

106
00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:54.179
I know this.

107
00:12:54.179 --> 00:12:56.179
What if I never came?

108
00:12:56.179 --> 00:12:59.850
What if I didn't escape?

109
00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:02.070
I never want to stop looking.

110
00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:30.980
How's it coming?

111
00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:31.980
Almost ready.

112
00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:34.940
What a beautiful place.

113
00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:36.620
Yeah.

114
00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:39.159
A lot of good memories.

115
00:13:39.159 --> 00:13:40.159
Ooh.

116
00:13:40.159 --> 00:13:41.539
Here we go.

117
00:13:41.539 --> 00:13:42.539
Just some time.

118
00:13:42.539 --> 00:13:43.539
Alright, let's eat.

119
00:13:43.539 --> 00:13:53.159
It's a lot of fun memories.

120
00:13:53.159 --> 00:14:10.100
Drink up.

121
00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:11.100
Cheers.

122
00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:12.100
Cheers.

123
00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:26.870
There goes nothing.

124
00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:27.870
What's going on?

125
00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:32.299
Close your eyes.

126
00:14:32.299 --> 00:14:34.529
Then follow me.

127
00:14:34.529 --> 00:14:35.529
What for?

128
00:14:35.529 --> 00:14:36.779
Trust me.

129
00:14:36.779 --> 00:14:49.190
You got two steps coming up here.

130
00:14:49.190 --> 00:14:50.190
Okay.

131
00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:51.190
Here's one.

132
00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:52.190
Good.

133
00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:53.669
One more.

134
00:14:53.669 --> 00:14:59.620
Now this is kind of fun.

135
00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:08.850
Yeah, this seems about right.

136
00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:15.899
Where'd you go?

137
00:15:15.899 --> 00:15:19.919
Okay, now you can open up.

138
00:15:19.919 --> 00:15:21.919
Today I'd like to form any propose to you.

139
00:15:21.919 --> 00:15:24.179
That's Ashley Green.

140
00:15:24.179 --> 00:15:26.179
Will you marry me?

141
00:15:26.179 --> 00:15:29.320
Again?

142
00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:31.320
The real me says yes.
