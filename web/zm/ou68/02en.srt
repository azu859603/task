1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,560
How can I help you?

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:07,559
Heather, sir, from Creative, I'm here to get your son off on the new camping puzzle.

3
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:14,070
And as for you, I don't need employees to pull stunts like that, so...

4
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:17,070
You're fired.

5
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:20,070
When do they call you Declan Ice?

6
00:00:22,129 --> 00:00:26,129
So, Heather, what do you think about this proposal?

7
00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:32,490
I think it's good.

8
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:36,000
But it could be better.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,859
For instance, the targeted demographic could be expanded.

10
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:49,250
And here, maybe adding some interactive elements.

11
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:52,719
Don't press it.

12
00:00:52,719 --> 00:01:06,719
My money on you, Heather.

13
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:08,069
So don't let me down.

14
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:23,980
Hey, dude.

15
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:27,870
Waitressing out Wayne's party tonight?

16
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:33,870
Uh, yeah.

17
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:34,870
Yeah, I'm in.

18
00:01:35,969 --> 00:01:37,969
No, I don't mind serving those rich snobs.

19
00:01:37,969 --> 00:01:39,969
As long as the money's right.

20
00:01:40,969 --> 00:01:41,969
Okay.

21
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:42,969
You see ya.

22
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:47,980
Get me on the guest list to the Wayne's party tonight.

23
00:01:48,980 --> 00:02:00,200
Be nice to the customers.

24
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,200
Good smile.
