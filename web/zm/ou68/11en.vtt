1
00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:23.429
You can't pay up. We're gonna have to sell your part. I wonder how much your kidneys were.

2
00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:34.950
Hey, get your hands off of her. Listen, we don't want any drama. Just pay up and we'll be on our way.

3
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.549
Yeah, Princess. We're starting coming out of that fancy pit house this morning. We know you got some dough.

4
00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:45.759
That promise is not mine. How much does she owe you? How much does she owe you?

5
00:00:45.759 --> 00:01:00.979
200,000. We need to pull it out thin air. 300,000. You give her back a few hours.

6
00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:13.209
That extra 100,000 is just a freebie. This little lady here needs to blow off some steam that she needs an elephant.

7
00:01:13.209 --> 00:01:18.239
So she gets to take some swings. Do you?

8
00:01:18.239 --> 00:02:06.420
I know it's a lot of money, but I'll find a way to pay you back. I promise. I'll pay you back. I promise.

9
00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.919
I think of a way for you to make some quick cash.

10
00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:13.090
Yeah? Yeah.

11
00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.060
Does she look from a sugar daddy? And by that I mean me.

12
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.560
But no offense, Mr. Ebert. Are you crazy?

13
00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.080
Oh, come on. Those mopsies that can track you down so easily.

14
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.849
You should just stay with me to save this elephant.

15
00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:34.479
Oh, that's what he meant. At least.

16
00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:39.039
I don't want to win though. Last time I checked, I'm still the boss.

17
00:02:39.039 --> 00:03:03.840
And I say that it's no problem at all. People are saying you're this cold.

18
00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.360
You're the best boss ever. Is that so? Yeah.

19
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:13.699
You look after your employees, even the ones who aren't all that special, like me.

20
00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:20.449
I tend to save my heroics for the ones who saved Sally my bed, like you did last night.

21
00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:26.969
Speaking of which, why did you sneak out so early this morning?

22
00:03:26.969 --> 00:03:33.819
Speaking of which, what did you sneak off to this morning?

23
00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:38.319
I had a lot of work to get done. I wanted an early start at the office.

24
00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:41.319
Speaking of which, I should probably have to work.

25
00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:43.819
There's just big and boring media and you get started on.

26
00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:48.020
Well, hey. Well, hey, if it's so important then I can just give you a ride.

27
00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.240
No, no, no, that's okay.

28
00:03:50.240 --> 00:04:06.000
No, but if it's as important as you say it is, then it deserves the attention of the boss too, right?

29
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:21.079
Let's go.

30
00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:24.079
My not surprised. She's trying to sleep her way to the top.

31
00:04:24.079 --> 00:04:35.519
Hey, what happened here?

32
00:04:35.519 --> 00:04:42.600
It's nothing. Honestly, just me being my usual clumsy self-smelling crying out.

33
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.079
If somebody is...

34
00:04:45.079 --> 00:04:52.540
Honestly, Mr. Reed, I think it could survive a little coffee school.

35
00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:57.040
But let's swing by my place first so you can change into something a little less caffeinated.

36
00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:02.730
It'll tramp trying to sink her teeth into the boss.

37
00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:38.910
Need a full wardrobe. Live her here and eat it with dresses, shoes, and spare no expense. Thank you.

38
00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:43.800
Mr. Reed, this is too generous.

39
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:44.800
This is just me.

40
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.600
One of the many perks of letting me so get used to it.

41
00:05:48.600 --> 00:06:49.649
So tell me, I'm moving you with me.

42
00:06:49.649 --> 00:06:53.279
Ork emergency.

43
00:06:53.279 --> 00:06:54.279
Hey, what's going on?

44
00:06:54.279 --> 00:06:59.399
I'm meeting you at the office just got canceled, but I have to be at the office as I happen.

45
00:06:59.399 --> 00:07:05.750
Look, Heather, I want you to be honest with me. Do you really enjoy working at that office?

46
00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:11.529
It's my job, to keep pushing through.

47
00:07:11.529 --> 00:07:18.019
Then I'll call my driver and he can take you back to the office.

48
00:07:18.019 --> 00:07:38.790
Mr. Reed sure knows how to spoil his fiancé, huh?

49
00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:40.199
I know.

50
00:07:40.199 --> 00:07:42.459
He's engaged.

51
00:07:42.459 --> 00:07:47.009
What?

52
00:07:47.009 --> 00:07:48.009
He's engaged?

53
00:07:48.009 --> 00:07:51.069
What's wrong with her?

54
00:07:51.069 --> 00:07:55.069
That's just Heather, our so-called visual designer.

55
00:07:55.069 --> 00:07:57.069
Honestly, she's the weakest link on the team.

56
00:07:57.069 --> 00:07:59.069
It's just not exactly eye candy either.

57
00:07:59.069 --> 00:08:01.069
And she's a nightmare to work with.

58
00:08:01.069 --> 00:08:06.069
Doesn't even have a college degree, lazy, incompetent, always causing drama.

59
00:08:06.069 --> 00:08:13.060
And this is supposed to be, I mean, how does she even lend this job?

60
00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:16.060
Probably by batting her eyelashes at the boss?

61
00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:21.610
Well, girl, how dare you?

62
00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:24.610
I can think you can steal my man.

63
00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:37.070
Lucky guy is.

64
00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:39.070
Probably so big shot.

65
00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:41.070
Or a boss himself.

66
00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:46.720
Have you been seducing my fiancé?

67
00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:49.070
Yeah!

68
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:55.059
Hey, Cole!

69
00:08:55.059 --> 00:08:56.059
Yeah!

70
00:08:56.059 --> 00:08:57.059
Get off me!

71
00:08:57.059 --> 00:09:01.759
Open wide, you nasty stinking whore.

72
00:09:01.759 --> 00:09:02.759
I mean, whore.

73
00:09:02.759 --> 00:09:36.850
I don't know what she is.

74
00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:39.419
What?

75
00:09:39.419 --> 00:09:41.419
And my ability.

76
00:09:41.419 --> 00:09:47.350
Any lovers, check me?

77
00:09:47.350 --> 00:10:00.409
Jane, let me know.

78
00:10:00.409 --> 00:10:08.710
Rose is a real train wreck.

79
00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:11.710
I guess the rotten apple doesn't fall apart from the disease tree.

80
00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:14.710
No wonder she said to screw up.

81
00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:15.710
Yeah.

82
00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:18.710
My group of damn families, nothing, with a bunch of junkies.

83
00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:19.710
And...

84
00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:20.710
Losers!

85
00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:24.629
Just look at her.

86
00:10:24.629 --> 00:10:25.629
I'm so pathetic.

87
00:10:25.629 --> 00:10:34.870
The hell is going on here?

88
00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:41.639
Karen, you're fired.

89
00:10:41.639 --> 00:10:47.679
What the hell is going on here?

90
00:10:47.679 --> 00:10:49.679
Karen, you're fired.

91
00:10:49.679 --> 00:10:51.679
Pat your shit up and leave now.

92
00:10:51.679 --> 00:10:56.039
And consider this a warning.

93
00:10:56.039 --> 00:11:02.620
Anyone who wants to harass or bully Heather will be out on the streets with Karen.

94
00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:06.970
You know, we belong together and we still have business when you talk.

95
00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:07.970
Finish!

96
00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:09.970
That will be wrapped up soon enough.

97
00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:12.830
I want to see you.

98
00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:27.830
Why does Mr. Reed treat Heather so different?

99
00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:30.279
Chick's going to mess up my plan.

100
00:11:30.279 --> 00:11:32.279
I need to take care of her first.

101
00:11:32.279 --> 00:11:39.389
Take your time.

102
00:11:39.389 --> 00:11:40.580
Brush her up.

103
00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:43.580
And if you need to go to the restaurant, it's right through that door, okay?

104
00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:45.929
I need to go, Mr. Reed.

105
00:11:45.929 --> 00:11:46.929
My brother.

106
00:11:46.929 --> 00:11:51.190
It's probably getting a score from his dealer.

107
00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:52.190
How?

108
00:11:52.190 --> 00:12:01.120
Am I right?

109
00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:03.279
Joey, I need you to track someone for me.

110
00:12:03.279 --> 00:12:05.279
I just sent you the information on your phone.

111
00:12:05.279 --> 00:12:06.279
Make it quick.

112
00:12:06.279 --> 00:12:10.850
My nephew Joey will track him down.

113
00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:13.929
Got him.

114
00:12:13.929 --> 00:12:19.100
Thank you, Mr. Reed.

115
00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:22.549
I think I can handle it from here.

116
00:12:22.549 --> 00:12:32.549
I'm going to let you go alone.

117
00:12:32.549 --> 00:12:34.090
Not a chance.

118
00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:45.509
What are you doing here?

119
00:12:45.509 --> 00:12:47.509
I can ask you the same thing you little punk.

120
00:12:47.509 --> 00:12:49.509
Aren't you supposed to be rehab?

121
00:12:49.509 --> 00:12:50.509
I can explain.

122
00:12:50.509 --> 00:12:51.509
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

123
00:12:51.509 --> 00:12:52.509
The win's take it easy.

124
00:12:52.509 --> 00:12:53.509
Take it easy.

125
00:12:53.509 --> 00:12:54.509
Who the fuck are you old man?

126
00:12:54.509 --> 00:12:55.509
Get easy.

127
00:12:55.509 --> 00:12:56.509
Let me go.

128
00:12:56.509 --> 00:13:00.549
No!

129
00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:06.080
I'm in the center, praying.

130
00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:08.169
You only get your shit together.

131
00:13:08.169 --> 00:13:11.169
You think I asked for any of this?

132
00:13:11.169 --> 00:13:13.169
You have no fucking idea what it's like.

133
00:13:13.169 --> 00:13:17.590
It's the cravings, the pain, the emptiness.

134
00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:20.610
You don't get to judge me.

135
00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:21.610
You have no right!

136
00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:29.919
Every right is on the one who has been a roof over your fucking head since mom has died.

137
00:13:29.919 --> 00:13:32.919
Why don't we just all take a deep breath here, okay?

138
00:13:32.919 --> 00:13:33.919
Everyone?

139
00:13:33.919 --> 00:13:36.330
No, I'm taking your ass back to rehab.

140
00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:37.490
No.

141
00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:38.490
I can't.

142
00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:39.559
I won't.

143
00:13:39.559 --> 00:13:40.559
And you can't make it.

144
00:13:40.559 --> 00:13:41.559
Hey, hey, hey.

145
00:13:41.559 --> 00:13:42.559
Hold on.

146
00:13:42.559 --> 00:13:44.559
Just take a deep breath.

147
00:13:44.559 --> 00:13:45.559
Okay?

148
00:13:45.559 --> 00:13:46.559
What do you want?

149
00:13:46.559 --> 00:13:48.200
What do you want?

150
00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:49.200
Give me the money.

151
00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:51.200
Boy and Kurt, where did you get that cut?

152
00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:52.200
I swear!

153
00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:53.200
Money!

154
00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:54.519
Damn it!

155
00:13:54.519 --> 00:13:55.519
Okay, okay.

156
00:13:55.519 --> 00:13:57.519
Look, this is all I have on me right now.

157
00:13:57.519 --> 00:14:02.879
Look, I have more in my car.

158
00:14:02.879 --> 00:14:05.200
We can go there and we can talk about this.

159
00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:07.200
We can resolve everything peacefully.

160
00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:08.649
Fine.

161
00:14:08.649 --> 00:14:13.149
But no funny business.

162
00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:16.210
That's enough for you.

163
00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:32.279
Let's go.

164
00:14:32.279 --> 00:14:33.279
Sneaky old bastard.

165
00:14:33.279 --> 00:14:43.309
Your friend's been locked up so there'll be no more little meetings between you two months.

166
00:14:43.309 --> 00:14:45.110
Thank you, Mr. Reed.

167
00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:46.110
Oh, my Declan.

168
00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:47.169
I answered.

169
00:14:47.169 --> 00:14:52.009
Thank you.

170
00:14:52.009 --> 00:14:54.009
He didn't do it for you, Sis.

171
00:14:54.009 --> 00:14:56.009
He just wants to get in your pants.

172
00:14:56.009 --> 00:14:57.009
Shut up, Florie.

173
00:14:57.009 --> 00:15:01.179
Alright, let's get ready.

174
00:15:01.179 --> 00:15:15.309
I was worried sick.

175
00:15:15.309 --> 00:15:18.309
Don't let him out of your sight, not even for a second jade.

176
00:15:18.309 --> 00:15:20.820
I don't need a fucking babysitter.

177
00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:25.950
Actually, Heather, we can move Florian to a private room with 24 seven security.

178
00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:26.950
Wow.

179
00:15:26.950 --> 00:15:32.669
But it comes at a much higher cost.

180
00:15:32.669 --> 00:15:33.669
I'll pick up the bill.

181
00:15:33.669 --> 00:15:34.669
Mr. Reed, no.

182
00:15:34.669 --> 00:15:36.669
Let me do this for you, Heather.

183
00:15:36.669 --> 00:15:39.200
Please.

184
00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:40.200
Let me do this for you, Heather.

185
00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:41.200
Please.

186
00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:42.200
I'll pay you back.

187
00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:44.360
Here's my assistant's number.

188
00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:48.360
You can call him to coordinate all of the transferring of Florian here and his treatment.

189
00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:49.360
Don't worry about the cost.

190
00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:59.590
Really appreciate this, Mr. Reed.

191
00:15:59.590 --> 00:16:00.590
You don't need to thank me.

192
00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:02.590
You leave with me now.

193
00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:04.779
Still, I'll pay you back.

194
00:16:04.779 --> 00:16:07.779
I'll find a way to make more money.

195
00:16:07.779 --> 00:16:11.840
If you're so sad on it, then I know a way that you can do that quickly.

196
00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:13.070
Yeah?

197
00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:14.129
How?

198
00:16:14.129 --> 00:16:18.129
For you to be my contracted lover.

199
00:16:18.129 --> 00:16:23.179
For you to be my contracted lover.

200
00:16:23.179 --> 00:16:26.460
Mr. Reed, I'm not sure.

201
00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:29.870
Yes, she's still not into me.

202
00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:32.870
Look, look, hey, there's no need to ever think this.

203
00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:37.250
I just had a fun night the other night and I'd like to continue the fun.

204
00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:40.730
No strings attached, just purely physical.

205
00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:46.220
Come on, just think of it this way.

206
00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:48.220
I can take care of your debt.

207
00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:50.220
I can pay off your brother's treatment.

208
00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:53.220
And I can make it so you don't have to work with those lousy coworkers ever again.

209
00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:55.700
What do you say?

210
00:16:55.700 --> 00:17:05.069
Mr. Reed, I accept your proposal.

211
00:17:05.069 --> 00:17:06.549
Good.

212
00:17:06.549 --> 00:17:08.930
Now, let me give you a ride home.

213
00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:10.930
It's been a hell of a day, hasn't it?
