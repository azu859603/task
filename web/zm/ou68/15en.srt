00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,810
Declan, how did you and Maeve break up?

2
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:14,179
Maeve and I, we were together for a long time.

3
00:00:14,179 --> 00:00:26,460
And then when my dad passed, and I had to step up with the company, she, she made a love me.

4
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:39,579
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have cried.

5
00:00:39,579 --> 00:00:47,590
Contracted lovers, right?

6
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:49,590
Probably best if we keep things professional.

7
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:55,630
I'm just here to make money, nothing more.

8
00:00:55,630 --> 00:01:05,879
Well, if that's the way you want to play it, be your job.
