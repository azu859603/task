00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:09.679
Looks like she's moved on to the buses in that view now.

2
00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:10.679
Typical.

3
00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.119
Heather!

4
00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:16.850
I know.

5
00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.850
We just met, but uh, I can't get you out of my head.

6
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.850
It's like fate brought us together.

7
00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:24.839
Joey!

8
00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:25.839
It's one day.

9
00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:33.179
It's all masking.

10
00:00:33.179 --> 00:00:34.179
One date.

11
00:00:34.179 --> 00:00:37.179
As a thank you for everything you've done for me.

12
00:00:37.179 --> 00:00:38.179
You won't regret it.

13
00:00:38.179 --> 00:00:46.039
Maybe this is exactly what I need.

14
00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:50.039
A distraction from Declan and Maeve's engagement.

15
00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.140
Oh, damn, Heather.

16
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.140
Upgrading from the boss to his younger, hotter nephew.

17
00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.460
I can do whatever I want.

18
00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.460
And you should mind your own business.
