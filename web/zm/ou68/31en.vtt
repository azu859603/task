1
00:00:02.859 --> 00:00:03.859
What's she got?

2
00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:10.310
They're little princesses all out of luck.

3
00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:15.480
Get away from him, fight him!

4
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:22.910
Fuck off!

5
00:00:22.910 --> 00:01:04.019
Easy, easy now.

6
00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.140
We don't need to talk about that right now,

7
00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.140
and we need to focus on getting you rest.

8
00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.030
Lauren, where's Lauren?

9
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.030
It's fine.

10
00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.579
I took care of him.

11
00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:16.579
He won't be creating any more trouble.

12
00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:25.909
Look, Heather, I just want to ask you one thing.

13
00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:28.010
I thought you were mad.

14
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:29.010
Joey and I.

15
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:36.900
I just need to make sure that my contracted lover

16
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.900
is in good shape so she can fulfill her duties.

17
00:01:39.900 --> 00:02:14.039
I can't have you distracted by family drama.

18
00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:16.039
But there's no way you could ever feel the same.

19
00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:18.550
After everything he's done for you,

20
00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.550
he's clearly had over heels for you.

21
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.550
No, it's just business to him.

22
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:23.550
Nothing more.

23
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.680
And let's not forget about Maeve,

24
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.680
his gorgeous ex-girlfriend.

25
00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.870
Hold up.

26
00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:30.870
Maeve?

27
00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.159
As in Maeve Mitchell?

28
00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:37.500
The lady who runs the fancy rehab center?

29
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:43.539
So he asked her for help.

30
00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:53.060
They're a match made in heaven.

31
00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.060
Now that everything is figured out with Lauren,

32
00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.159
I've saved up.

33
00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:02.180
I'm going to study art.

34
00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.180
Maybe that will let me get over these ridiculous feelings

35
00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.300
for Declan.

36
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.300
Heather?

37
00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:17.580
I just got you an interview with the Top London Art Gallery.

38
00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.580
I just got you an interview with the Top London Art Gallery.

39
00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.800
Wow, wow, that's amazing.

40
00:03:27.689 --> 00:04:05.219
I've never seen her do that.

41
00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:07.219
I don't know.

42
00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:14.719
Could she be pregnant?

43
00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:29.819
We're more careful about accepting drinks from ex's baby.

44
00:04:29.819 --> 00:05:15.529
What are you doing?

45
00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:16.529
Yeah, you're gonna?

46
00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:23.800
No, Maeve.

47
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:24.800
Maeve!

48
00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.089
Maeve!

49
00:05:26.089 --> 00:05:47.579
All I need for you to help me.

50
00:05:47.579 --> 00:05:58.629
You've got yourself a deal.

51
00:05:58.629 --> 00:06:00.629
So the baby's about two weeks along.

52
00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:05.019
What's your plan?

53
00:06:05.019 --> 00:06:28.810
Wait, who's a what?

54
00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:37.079
I'm so sad when he saw me.

55
00:06:37.079 --> 00:06:40.959
Is everything okay?

56
00:06:40.959 --> 00:06:44.500
Heather, trying so hard to stay clean.

57
00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:45.860
It's a constant battle.

58
00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:47.860
Hey, I'm here for you.

59
00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:49.209
What can I do?

60
00:06:49.209 --> 00:06:52.209
Can you meet me outside the rehab center?

61
00:06:52.209 --> 00:06:54.209
I could really use my sister's support.

62
00:06:54.209 --> 00:06:56.209
The same time.

63
00:06:56.209 --> 00:06:57.269
I'm on my way.

64
00:06:57.269 --> 00:07:11.569
Well, if it is a little home locker,

65
00:07:11.569 --> 00:07:18.740
then you do it to me.

66
00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:22.600
We'll use U.S. bait to lure Declan here.

67
00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:25.139
Kill him, and then you.

68
00:07:25.139 --> 00:07:31.850
And we'll use it to panic.

69
00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:33.850
Aren't you killing for sure, Daddy?

70
00:07:35.259 --> 00:07:39.410
In order to find your donkey weather.

71
00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:40.410
Lori, please.

72
00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:54.060
What do you want, Maeve?

73
00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:57.689
We have to enter right away.

74
00:07:57.689 --> 00:07:59.779
For danger.

75
00:07:59.779 --> 00:08:00.779
No.

76
00:08:00.779 --> 00:08:02.779
And why should I care?

77
00:08:02.779 --> 00:08:11.170
And why should I care?

78
00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:21.810
When Jade told me that Lori and escaped again,

79
00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:23.810
I knew I had to tell you.

80
00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:26.019
Well, thank God you got to me in time.

81
00:08:26.019 --> 00:08:29.019
Now we have a head start on tracking her location.

82
00:08:29.019 --> 00:08:30.790
So what's the plan?

83
00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:38.779
Stupid plan's falling apart.

84
00:08:38.779 --> 00:08:40.899
Come on for this.

85
00:08:40.899 --> 00:08:45.259
No, no, no.

86
00:08:45.259 --> 00:08:48.559
Hey, hey, hey.

87
00:08:48.559 --> 00:08:49.559
Thank you.

88
00:08:49.559 --> 00:08:50.690
Look at me.

89
00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:51.690
You'll be fine.

90
00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:53.039
You're okay.

91
00:08:53.039 --> 00:08:54.330
You're fine.

92
00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:55.330
The baby's fine.

93
00:08:55.330 --> 00:09:24.820
That we've had her ups and downs.

94
00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:30.639
But I don't want to spend another day without you by my side.

95
00:09:30.639 --> 00:09:38.840
Heather Kirk.

96
00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:41.289
Will you marry me?

97
00:09:41.289 --> 00:10:07.299
Dearly Beloved, we are gathered here today to celebrate the union of Declan and Heather.

98
00:10:07.299 --> 00:10:13.809
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

99
00:10:13.809 --> 00:10:15.809
You may now kiss the bride.
