1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:03,640
So, you're your lambda son.

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:06,440
I remember you and Charlotte shared the same birthday, isn't that right?

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,440
Yes, sir.

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,929
This has been so unsafe lately.

5
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:12,230
I don't want our precious daughter in any danger.

6
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:14,730
Mom, I'm perfectly fine on my own.

7
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:17,879
Charlotte, you're almost 21 now.

8
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:20,379
Don't make your mother and I worry about you.

9
00:00:20,379 --> 00:00:22,579
I don't even know why we send you to college.

10
00:00:22,579 --> 00:00:25,079
You've shown interest in nothing other than partying.

11
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:33,149
Mr. Bolton, please don't be so hard under it.

12
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:36,969
I've actually heard that Ms. Bolton is doing quite well in school.

13
00:00:36,969 --> 00:00:40,729
Maybe just give her an opportunity to prove herself, sir.

14
00:00:40,729 --> 00:00:48,579
Mm-hmm.

15
00:00:48,579 --> 00:00:50,950
Come in.

16
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:51,950
Did you call for me, Miss?

17
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:58,770
I hate being called Miss.

18
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:02,560
Hey, thanks for what you said at dinner.

19
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,439
I really appreciate that.

20
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:07,209
My dad just doesn't get it.

21
00:01:07,209 --> 00:01:11,209
You know, the things that are important to me, he doesn't care about.

22
00:01:11,209 --> 00:01:14,489
Sorry that you had to see that.

23
00:01:14,489 --> 00:01:17,549
I understand, Charlotte.

24
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:21,379
I mean, my mom talks about you all the time.

25
00:01:21,379 --> 00:01:24,379
She says your father is very strict and your mother is very busy.

26
00:01:24,379 --> 00:01:26,379
But you just want to be yourself.

27
00:01:26,379 --> 00:01:30,590
There's nothing wrong with that.

28
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:36,230
I didn't realize Yolanda was so attentive.

29
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:38,930
She really cares about you.

30
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:40,930
Hey, why don't we just, why don't we be friends?

31
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:44,019
Call me Charlotte.

32
00:01:44,019 --> 00:01:46,019
Don't call me Miss ever again.

33
00:01:46,019 --> 00:01:48,019
If you do, I'll fire you.

34
00:01:48,019 --> 00:01:50,849
As you wish, Charlotte.
