00:00:04.429 --> 00:00:08.589
Don't touch him. He's mine. You're the Welch's daughter.

2
00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:13.330
Bridger investments went belly up. Now you're too broke to afford your own toys.

3
00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:14.529
Let's go.

4
00:00:18.559 --> 00:00:26.449
Where did she kiss you? What, like, you liked it?

5
00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:29.449
No, no, I didn't. It's just Caroline.

6
00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:31.449
Miss Welch is from the affluent family.

7
00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:35.450
I couldn't risk pushing her too hard and hurting her. They would come after me.

8
00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.340
Are you scared of them?

9
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.240
Listen, if you stick with me, I won't let them burn you.

10
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:47.630
Do you think the bulletins are scared? Don't ever talk to those girls again.

11
00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.859
You don't embarrass me like that.

12
00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:54.859
I'm sorry, okay. It's my fault, but Charlotte, you just kissed me in front of all those people.

13
00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:55.859
I mean, they...

14
00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:58.770
What? You don't want to be kissed by me?

15
00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.060
Listen, Erin, you're my servant now. I can do whatever I want to.

16
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.540
So if I want to kiss you, then I'll kiss you.
