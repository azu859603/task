1
00:00:09,869 --> 00:00:11,570
How's she doing, doctor?

2
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:14,250
Well, it seems like Ms. Bolton's allergic to seafood.

3
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:15,689
She had anaphylactic shock.

4
00:00:15,689 --> 00:00:18,010
Her airway collapsed, her blood pressure dropped.

5
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:19,489
She's in the coma.

6
00:00:19,489 --> 00:00:22,570
You weren't known until she wakes up with me brain damage.

7
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:24,649
It's a very rare condition, about 2% of people,

8
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:28,050
and likely genetic, as I have to ask,

9
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:29,570
which one used allergic to seafood?

10
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,079
This is impossible.

11
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:34,840
None of us is allergic to seafood.

12
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:36,920
Neither one of us is allergic,

13
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,500
so how could your other be?

14
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,299
Camille, did you and she don't mean that?

15
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:45,409
Oh, stop blaming me.

16
00:00:45,409 --> 00:00:47,530
I have done nothing wrong.

17
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:51,369
Hold on, Ms. Subalton, it doesn't have to be genetic.

18
00:00:51,369 --> 00:00:52,689
Okay?

19
00:00:52,689 --> 00:00:54,729
But if you're like, we could run a paternity test.

20
00:00:54,729 --> 00:00:56,530
Yes, I would like.

21
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:58,250
Let's do a paternity test.

22
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,170
If she's not my daughter, Camille.

23
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:01,049
She's my daughter.

24
00:01:02,259 --> 00:01:03,100
What?

25
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:03,939
What?

26
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:05,290
What?

27
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:07,689
Oh, she's my daughter.

28
00:01:07,689 --> 00:01:09,650
I'm allergic to seafood.

29
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:10,489
No!

30
00:01:10,489 --> 00:01:11,769
She got it from me.

31
00:01:11,769 --> 00:01:12,609
Oh, what?

32
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,250
I switched the babies.

33
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:26,459
I switched my daughter for your son.

34
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:27,299
Where is she?

35
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:28,760
How is she?

36
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,359
She's stable, son, but it looks like

37
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:37,239
they have some news for you.

38
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:43,640
What news?

39
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:48,299
I'm not your real mom.

40
00:01:48,299 --> 00:02:00,930
The Boltons are biological parents with their son.
