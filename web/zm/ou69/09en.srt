Aaron, we need to talk. I've been carrying this secret for so long, your whole life.

2
00:00:21,059 --> 00:00:26,719
I'm really sorry that you had to find out under these circumstances. Why? Why would you do that to me?

3
00:00:27,949 --> 00:00:36,640
Because I was desperate. I had to give a better life to my daughter. I'm so sorry. How could you?

4
00:00:38,109 --> 00:00:44,859
Do you have any idea what you did to be? Do you have any idea what my life has been like?

5
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,140
I was her bodyguard. Well, I was her personal servant.

6
00:00:51,020 --> 00:01:11,890
Always one step behind her, always in her shadow. Aaron, I'm begging you. Please, when you

7
00:01:12,769 --> 00:01:19,969
when you take your rightful place as the bolt in air, please be merciful to Charlotte. She's innocent

8
00:01:19,969 --> 00:01:44,689
in all this. Aaron, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Phil, as my maid, to make up for everything

9
00:01:44,689 --> 00:01:47,250
all the years that I lost.
