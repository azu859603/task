00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:04.169
I will never be yours.

2
00:00:04.169 --> 00:00:05.870
I don't care if you're a Bolton ear.

3
00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:07.710
To me, you're just a farm boy.

4
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.640
Oh, isn't that our dear Miss Bolton?

5
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:14.939
My bad.

6
00:00:14.939 --> 00:00:16.739
She's not a Bolton anymore.

7
00:00:16.739 --> 00:00:18.649
News travels fast.

8
00:00:18.649 --> 00:00:24.920
Our poor little Charlotte is just Miss homeless now, isn't she?

9
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.719
Hey, Erin, congratulations.

10
00:00:26.719 --> 00:00:28.519
Have you lost your mind?

11
00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:29.820
Caroline, I'm warning you.

12
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.519
Do not disturb us anymore.

13
00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:33.219
Even though Charlotte is no longer a Bolton,

14
00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:34.719
she's under my protection.

15
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.030
Now go.

16
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.659
And Caroline, you know, I never cared about any of the things

17
00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:46.759
that you said to me, but if you ever threatened her again,

18
00:00:46.759 --> 00:01:01.829
I will tear you apart.

19
00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.599
Why are you standing up for me?

20
00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:09.510
I thought you wanted to hurt me.

21
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.890
I told you you're mine now.

22
00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.090
Only I can harm you.

23
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.780
The Bolton's are planning my welcome ceremony.

24
00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.780
You're my man now, so you're expected to be there.
