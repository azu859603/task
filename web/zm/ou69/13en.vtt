00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.080
You're such a hypocrite.

2
00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:04.980
You weren't there for her when she gave birth.

3
00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.980
If you were there for her, none of this would have ever happened.

4
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.980
You don't care about anyone in this family. All you care about is money.

5
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.390
You know what? I'm glad I'm not your daughter.

6
00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:17.390
It seems you can't grow out of being the spoiled brat you are.

7
00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.390
The Bowdoin family doesn't need servants like you.

8
00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.579
I don't ever want to see you in my house again.

9
00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:27.030
Dad. Dad, please don't be upset.

10
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:28.030
Aaron, you're here.

11
00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:31.829
Charlotte can be arrogant sometimes.

12
00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:35.149
But for my sake, can we keep her around?

13
00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:37.149
I didn't get the best education when I was younger.

14
00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:41.539
But Charlotte is the same age as me. I believe I could learn a lot from her.

15
00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:48.000
All right. But you're definitely much better than this brat.

16
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.380
At least you know how to avoid bringing shame to your own family.

17
00:00:51.380 --> 00:01:06.609
I have no say in front of your father anymore.

18
00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:11.090
I just hope you can protect Charlotte. Keep her safe.

19
00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:28.590
Don't worry. I will. Are you okay?

20
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.780
I'm fine. And you know what? I don't want your pity.

21
00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.870
Okay? I'd rather leave here than be stuck with all of you.

22
00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:37.870
Charlotte.
