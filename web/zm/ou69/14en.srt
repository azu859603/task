00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Welcome home, my son, Ari.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,900
Let me introduce you to Andy and Clement.

3
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:17,940
They're the heirs of the Carlson's and Wilson's.

4
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:23,230
Oh, my.

5
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:25,230
That is a hell.

6
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:26,230
Why?

7
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:28,809
He just ate it with his hands.

8
00:00:28,809 --> 00:00:30,809
Oh.

9
00:00:30,809 --> 00:00:34,990
Did it come with me, Charlotte?

10
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:39,810
Why didn't you tell me about the napkin?

11
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:41,810
I didn't think you'd be that dumb.

12
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:42,810
You've been my bodyguard for years.

13
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:46,340
I thought you'd figure it out by now.

14
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:50,340
Listen, I don't want to be your maid or your babysitter.

15
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:53,340
If it weren't for you, I could have left the Bolton family.

16
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:54,340
I could have done something with my life.

17
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:56,340
I could have been someone.

18
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:59,729
Charlotte, the only way to protect you is happening by my side.
