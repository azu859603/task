00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Aaron, I have some great news.

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.679
Caroline Welch, the daughter of Aidan Welch,

3
00:00:05.679 --> 00:00:09.640
the richest man in the country, has agreed to marry you.

4
00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.900
She's agreed?

5
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.099
I never asked.

6
00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:16.699
My dear son, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity

7
00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:20.440
to be the son-in-law of the wealthiest family.

8
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.160
You start off with an engagement

9
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.579
and then eventually develop feelings over time.

10
00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:28.820
So I have to marry Caroline.

11
00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.270
The Welch family will greatly benefit our family business.

12
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.070
You will not regret this marriage.

13
00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.340
I understand your difficulties, Father.

14
00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.439
More so, I want to share the burden of Bolton family.

15
00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:46.539
So I'll agree to marry Caroline.

16
00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:48.060
When do we start the arrangements?

17
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:54.539
Next week, the arrangements will start next week.

18
00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.229
What?

19
00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:58.070
He's going to marry Caroline?
