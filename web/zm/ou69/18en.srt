1
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:16,140
I shouldn't have fallen for you, Eric.

2
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:22,289
Charlotte, are you crying?

3
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:24,050
No, I'm not. Just leave me alone.

4
00:00:24,739 --> 00:00:26,980
I'm forced into this marriage. You know this.

5
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:28,579
I don't want any part in this.

6
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:32,479
Don't refuse me.

7
00:00:33,649 --> 00:00:35,810
Why? All I am is your maid.

8
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,719
Just worn this for the past three years.

9
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:39,679
Then let's take it off.

10
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,689
Aaron, I'm serious.

11
00:00:42,689 --> 00:00:50,899
I don't want a marriage family. I'll quit for something else.

12
00:00:50,899 --> 00:00:51,859
I'm serious, Eric.

13
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:12,859
Go get ready.

14
00:01:12,859 --> 00:01:17,969
I can't wait for you to marry her.

15
00:01:17,969 --> 00:01:37,060
Look when the time comes.
