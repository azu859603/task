1
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:14,849
What are you doing?

2
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:15,849
You look incredible.

3
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:21,719
Not now, Aaron.

4
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:23,719
Ever since you stood up for me all those years ago,

5
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:24,719
what is this?

6
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:25,719
Charlotte.

7
00:00:25,719 --> 00:00:27,719
At the Welsh community ball, I'm going to disappoint everyone.

8
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:29,719
They're going to have to cancel the engagements.

9
00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:30,719
No, no.

10
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:33,719
You belong to me, and I can only be with you.

11
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:36,810
Aaron, no.

12
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:37,810
I'm serious.

13
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:39,810
Hey, listen to me.

14
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:40,969
Charlotte.

15
00:00:40,969 --> 00:00:41,969
Stop.

16
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:42,969
I don't want to marry Caroline.

17
00:00:42,969 --> 00:00:43,969
It's always been you.

18
00:00:43,969 --> 00:00:44,969
Stop.

19
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:47,350
I've already made the decision,

20
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:48,350
and I'm saving up money.

21
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:49,350
And as soon as you marry Caroline,

22
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,350
I'm taking me and my law I'm out of here.

23
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:53,350
Please don't do this, isn't Charlotte.

24
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:56,350
I've spent years bettering myself for you.

25
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:58,179
Who are you kidding?

26
00:00:58,179 --> 00:01:02,179
I could never marry a hick like you.
