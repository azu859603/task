1
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,960
Why are you not picking up your phone?

2
00:00:10,089 --> 00:00:11,089
Hey, God, you're okay.

3
00:00:11,089 --> 00:00:12,089
Hey, what's going on?

4
00:00:12,089 --> 00:00:18,089
We just got a call from someone who claimed that they've kidnapped a Bolton kid and demanded $10 million.

5
00:00:18,089 --> 00:00:20,089
Mr. Bolton?

6
00:00:20,089 --> 00:00:22,440
Where's Charlotte?

7
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,440
Didn't she come back with you?

8
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,440
No, Charlotte should be here already. She left earlier.

9
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,440
What?

10
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:32,390
Those guys could have kidnapped her.

11
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:33,390
Oh, my God!

12
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:39,560
Hey, we need to get her to the hospital right now.

13
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:43,990
She's so breathing.

14
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:44,990
But hurry.

15
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:49,420
Be here for five minutes.

16
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:54,630
Aaron, your lawn has been like a mom to you for years.

17
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:56,700
Same goes for me and Charlotte.

18
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,859
She's my little girl through and through.

19
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:03,429
And even though your dad won't say it, he feels the same way.

20
00:01:03,429 --> 00:01:08,620
Hey, Mom, I know she'll be okay, but Charlotte.

21
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:13,459
Mom, hey, I promise I will protect Charlotte, okay?

22
00:01:13,459 --> 00:01:32,379
I'm gonna go find her right now.

23
00:01:32,379 --> 00:01:33,510
Stop!

24
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:37,700
Which one of you is heading?

25
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:38,700
It's me.

26
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:39,700
Where's my son?

27
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:40,700
Where's Aaron?

28
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:41,700
Hey!

29
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,620
Oh, she dies.

30
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:48,019
She?

31
00:01:48,019 --> 00:01:50,180
Charlotte, I thought it was Aaron.

32
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:53,049
Dad, you have to help me.

33
00:01:53,049 --> 00:01:54,049
Charlotte, what are you?

34
00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:56,049
Buddy, is this your fake daughter?

35
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:58,500
I heard that she's close to Aaron.

36
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:03,500
And frankly, I don't want anything to potentially hurt my daughter's marriage.

37
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,750
Yeah, hate him.

38
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:10,289
Charlotte, I raised her as a little kid.

39
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:12,289
Dad, please.

40
00:02:12,289 --> 00:02:13,289
I can't.

41
00:02:13,289 --> 00:02:15,289
I have to save her.

42
00:02:15,289 --> 00:02:17,289
You play hero and try to save her.

43
00:02:17,289 --> 00:02:18,289
The wedding is off.

44
00:02:18,289 --> 00:02:21,289
And you know me, I don't let things goes enough.

45
00:02:21,289 --> 00:02:23,289
Bolton's family will be toast.

46
00:02:23,289 --> 00:02:24,479
For what?

47
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:27,479
A girl who's not even really your kid?

48
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:29,539
It's your call.

49
00:02:29,539 --> 00:02:30,539
Dad, please.

50
00:02:30,539 --> 00:02:31,539
Dad.

51
00:02:31,539 --> 00:02:32,580
I'm sorry.

52
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,580
Dad, please.

53
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:34,580
Dad, I'm sorry.

54
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:35,580
Dad.

55
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:36,580
Sorry.

56
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:37,580
Hey!

57
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:38,699
Get back here!

58
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:39,699
Get back!
