1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,399
If I'd never see you again.

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:07,500
What happened? Are you okay? Oh, you heard?

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,630
What's going on here?

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,179
Hayden and I have known each other for years.

5
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:16,429
His family wouldn't let us be together.

6
00:00:16,429 --> 00:00:19,429
So I left so that he wouldn't lose everything.

7
00:00:19,429 --> 00:00:24,160
You were here this whole time?

8
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,019
I'm so sorry.

9
00:00:27,019 --> 00:00:30,019
I just didn't want you to have to make the wrong choice.

10
00:00:30,019 --> 00:00:33,179
And look at your life now.

11
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:36,179
You have your family. You have your family fortune.

12
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:38,179
You have everything you ever wanted.

13
00:00:38,179 --> 00:00:42,850
Oh, I missed you so much.

14
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:50,179
This is an odd time to tell you this, but...

15
00:00:50,179 --> 00:00:54,460
We have a daughter?

16
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:56,460
Oh my God.

17
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,799
Where is she?

18
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:02,270
She's right here.

19
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,560
She's my daughter.

20
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:08,090
What?

21
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:11,090
Hayden and I are your biological parents.
