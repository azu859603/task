1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,379
Aidan and I are your biological parents.

2
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:06,929
I don't understand.

3
00:00:06,929 --> 00:00:11,369
Aidan, this is your father, honey.

4
00:00:11,369 --> 00:00:12,369
What?

5
00:00:12,369 --> 00:00:16,649
I only heard just that from your mother.

6
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:17,780
Hector.

7
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:22,780
Thank you for taking care of them all these years.

8
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:29,370
From now on, you both are under my care.

9
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:33,369
Aaron, you saved my daughter's life.

10
00:00:33,369 --> 00:00:35,369
You are good enough to marry my daughter.

11
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:36,369
Charlotte.

12
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:37,369
What?

13
00:00:37,369 --> 00:00:38,369
What?

14
00:00:38,369 --> 00:00:39,399
What?

15
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:41,460
You...

16
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,490
No, I want to.

17
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:45,810
Thank you, Mr. Worldge.

18
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:52,509
I don't want to be married.

19
00:00:52,509 --> 00:00:58,759
I don't want to be someone's bride or lover.

20
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:02,759
Charlotte, I think the molten family would be a good match.

21
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:05,549
It's okay.

22
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:16,700
If you're unable to get married, I want to insist.

23
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,700
I love you so much, Jordan.

24
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,069
I always have.

25
00:01:21,069 --> 00:01:24,900
Will you please marry me?
