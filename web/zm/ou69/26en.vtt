1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.810
Will you please marry me?

2
00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:16.339
Charlotte, just say yes for now.

3
00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:23.519
Well, that's settled then.

4
00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:24.420
It's late.

5
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.320
Charlotte needs to get her rest.

6
00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.260
We'll talk about all this later.

7
00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:38.210
Aaron, come on.

8
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.549
Will you?

9
00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:41.750
You'll be back?

10
00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:53.320
Mom, why didn't you let me refuse?

11
00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.530
I don't want to get married.

12
00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:03.310
Honey, you have to marry her.

13
00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:04.109
Why?

14
00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:10.489
A long time ago, when Aidan and I were madly in love,

15
00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:14.480
his family would not allow her.

16
00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.079
Allow it, they ripped us apart,

17
00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:21.909
and they forced him to marry Samantha.

18
00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:26.439
The Duke's daughter, because she was a Duke's daughter.

19
00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:29.629
So we lost each other.

20
00:01:29.629 --> 00:01:33.150
And now, if you don't marry Aaron,

21
00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.260
he's going to be forced to marry Caroline.

22
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.579
The whole thing happening all over again.

23
00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.719
Plus, I'm back in the picture.

24
00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:45.219
Samantha will stop it and nothing

25
00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:47.219
to destroy you and me.

26
00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:51.590
And she can do it.

27
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:52.590
I'm so sorry.

28
00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.219
I didn't realize that.

29
00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.379
I'm going to talk to Aidan

30
00:01:58.379 --> 00:02:02.379
and make sure that this wedding gets planned

31
00:02:02.379 --> 00:02:05.019
as soon as possible.
