1
00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:12.740
My favorite part.

2
00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.580
No, no, no, no, no, you can't see her before the wedding.

3
00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.019
It's bad luck, bad luck, out, long.

4
00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:21.839
Do you mind if I have a private moment with Charlotte?

5
00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:23.600
Okay, you've seen him already.

6
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:36.960
So I guess it's okay.

7
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.740
Are you really that unwilling to marry me?

8
00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.179
Listen, Erin, you might be the Bolton heir now,

9
00:00:43.179 --> 00:00:45.960
but you were always just my bodyguard.

10
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.020
It's not too late.

11
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.820
If you're unwilling, I have no choice

12
00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:50.740
than to marry Caroline.

13
00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.020
She's sitting out there right now.

14
00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.979
Stop daydreaming, Erin.

15
00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:59.759
The Welch and Bolton families have decided it has to be me.

16
00:00:59.759 --> 00:01:01.049
Okay?

17
00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:03.450
Do you have any feelings for me whatsoever?

18
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.920
Do you have any memory of what you've put me through?

19
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.060
Don't be so naive, Erin.

20
00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.849
This marriage is a collaboration between two families.

21
00:01:13.849 --> 00:01:16.810
It's for mutual interest, not love.
