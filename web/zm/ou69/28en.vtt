00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.140
Let's find out if it's known for love.

2
00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:10.300
Oops. Looks like I've walked into the wrong time.

3
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:15.769
Oh, my sister and brother-in-law are so lovey-dovey.

4
00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:17.769
I guess I don't stand a chance.

5
00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:19.929
Hello, Caroline.

6
00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:24.940
This ring is stunning.

7
00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.230
I know. Thank you.

8
00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.579
Charlotte, your makeup's mine.

9
00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:32.579
Here, let me help you.

10
00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.909
I'm sorry I didn't mean to.

11
00:00:38.909 --> 00:00:42.100
You obviously meant to, Caroline.

12
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.100
The wedding's in ten minutes.

13
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.100
Listen, don't worry. I'm gonna go get a new wedding dress from the store down the street.

14
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:57.859
I could have told him that somebody paid the store owner to close the store early today.

15
00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:00.859
Aaron will never find a new dress in ten minutes.

16
00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:06.500
What exactly are you doing here, Caroline?

17
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.010
Listen, sister.

18
00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.010
I'm supposed to marry Aaron.

19
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.010
I know you don't even want to marry him.
