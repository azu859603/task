1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,109
I'm supposed to marry Erin.

2
00:00:02,109 --> 00:00:07,669
I know you don't even want to marry him.

3
00:00:07,669 --> 00:00:13,880
Think about how he's treated you all these years.

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,880
Give me the ring.

5
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,879
And you can take Yolanda whatever you...

6
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:23,149
Yolanda?

7
00:00:23,149 --> 00:00:25,339
No. I've made up my mind.

8
00:00:25,339 --> 00:00:27,339
Yes, the sooner the better.

9
00:00:27,339 --> 00:00:29,339
We're pushing the reception back by an epinar.

10
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:31,339
I'm getting you that dress.

11
00:00:31,339 --> 00:00:35,649
Oh my God, what are you doing?

12
00:00:35,649 --> 00:00:39,409
Let's go.

13
00:00:39,409 --> 00:00:42,409
Charlotte, you were truly amazing.

14
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:45,340
I'm not stupid, Caroline.

15
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:47,340
Erin is mine.

16
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,340
You can go take your seat.

17
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:59,640
Hey everyone, before we begin, thank you for gathering here.

18
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,640
We're not only here to celebrate the wedding of my long lost daughter,

19
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,640
I have a very important announcement to make.

20
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:13,060
I have decided to leave the majority of the Welch family fortune

21
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,060
to my eldest daughter, Charlotte.

22
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:20,430
Dot this right now.
