1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:04,080
Stop this right now, Mom.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,110
Samantha, what are you doing?

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:10,220
Aiden, I am still your wife.

4
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:12,580
Don't I have the right to be here?

5
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:16,219
And besides, Erin is supposed to be marrying my daughter.

6
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:17,579
That's not your decision to make.

7
00:00:17,579 --> 00:00:19,460
Listen, it's not your wedding to crash.

8
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,640
Carolina's still young.

9
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:25,800
And she will have other opportunities to find a man.

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,920
You little slut.

11
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,660
You're just like your mom, that snake, Yolanda.

12
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:33,780
She wrecked my marriage, and now you

13
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,579
have the nerve to do the same to Caroline.

14
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:40,619
Samantha, you sabotaged my relationship with Aiden.

15
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:42,820
You almost ruined our lives.

16
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,219
But no.

17
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:46,299
Enough.

18
00:00:46,299 --> 00:00:51,689
Aiden, the Welch family owes its prominence to my family.

19
00:00:51,689 --> 00:00:55,289
And now you just decide to abandon me and Caroline

20
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:58,289
for her little slut.

21
00:00:58,369 --> 00:01:04,049
Samantha, this has nothing to do with Yolanda or Charlotte.

22
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:05,569
Just tell me what you want.

23
00:01:05,569 --> 00:01:06,930
Name your price, OK?

24
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:11,730
Just do not mess up Charlotte and Erin's special day,

25
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:14,049
any more than you already have.

26
00:01:14,049 --> 00:01:16,030
All right, then.

27
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:19,230
I want you to turn over the Welch family fortune

28
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:20,349
to Caroline.

29
00:01:20,349 --> 00:01:21,709
Absolutely not.
