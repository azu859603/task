1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:02,370
Caroline, what are you doing in here?

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:03,370
Erin.

3
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:04,370
No.

4
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:05,370
Don't tell me you don't like it.

5
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:06,879
No.

6
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:10,480
Get out.

7
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,480
Sure.

8
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,480
What's going on here?

9
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,480
Don't let me interrupt.

10
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,480
No, listen, this is not what it looks like.

11
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,120
Shh.

12
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,850
I'm not mad.

13
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:21,850
Charlotte, you're so generous.

14
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:25,010
Ben, I guess I'll continue.

15
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:27,649
I've been.

16
00:00:27,649 --> 00:00:29,899
Why not all three of us?

17
00:00:29,899 --> 00:00:30,899
Really?

18
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:32,899
It's the three of us?

19
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:33,899
Sure.

20
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:34,899
Why not?

21
00:00:34,899 --> 00:00:36,899
But you should know.

22
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:38,899
Erin has some fetishes.

23
00:00:38,899 --> 00:00:40,899
What fetishes?

24
00:00:40,899 --> 00:00:42,899
Well, Caroline, I grew up in the countryside.

25
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:44,899
We used to do it in the farm.

26
00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:49,060
We'd be rolling around in the hay and listening to all the animals.

27
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:50,060
Mm-hmm.

28
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:53,219
Especially the cows.

29
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,280
The cows?

30
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,380
Yeah.

31
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:57,380
How's knowing?

32
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,979
It really turns me on.

33
00:00:59,979 --> 00:01:01,979
Like this?

34
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:02,979
Moo.

35
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:05,590
Moo.

36
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:06,590
Is this how?

37
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:07,590
Kind of.

38
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:08,590
Maybe a little bit more.

39
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:10,140
Mm-hmm.

40
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,140
Mm-hmm.

41
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:13,959
Yeah.

42
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:14,959
Keep going.

43
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:15,959
Just like that.

44
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:29,379
Mm-hmm.

45
00:01:29,379 --> 00:01:30,379
Just go to the St. Emperor hotel.

46
00:01:30,379 --> 00:01:31,569
What?

47
00:01:31,569 --> 00:01:33,459
Mm.

48
00:01:33,459 --> 00:01:34,459
She's planning something.

49
00:01:34,459 --> 00:01:35,459
I have to stop her.

50
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:37,010
Coming with you.
