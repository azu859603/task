00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:09,210
I'm sorry to disappoint you Madam, but this really is all just a coincidence.

2
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:13,189
I was concerned about Charlotte's safety, so I had her followed by security.

3
00:00:13,189 --> 00:00:16,390
It turns out it was Adrienne and his sister Lisa staying at the hotel.

4
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:19,850
Charlotte was only there for a few minutes.

5
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:22,140
You had me followed?

6
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,989
I just had to be sure.

7
00:00:24,989 --> 00:00:28,989
Honestly Samantha, if Adrienne had only lasted five minutes, you wouldn't still be his lover.

8
00:00:28,989 --> 00:00:30,219
Now would you?

9
00:00:30,219 --> 00:00:34,700
You're the one manipulating everyone and you have the nerve to pin it on Charlotte?

10
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,579
We don't need your drama.

11
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:38,890
Get lost.

12
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:40,689
Just you wait and see Charlotte.

13
00:00:40,689 --> 00:00:51,240
I'm sorry I didn't trust him.

14
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,240
I love him.

15
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:58,189
If Aaron doesn't trust me, can I trust him to be our baby's father?
