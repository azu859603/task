1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,139
I know that's where everything is right now. There's still a lot of the ropes that I need to learn about the business

2
00:00:05,139 --> 00:00:09,380
Yeah, I'm trying about the same result. It's just why I mean I like that

3
00:00:09,779 --> 00:00:11,779
We're gonna expand that portfolio

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,359
What's wrong with her? Are you too? Okay?

5
00:00:15,099 --> 00:00:18,469
And we're fine. Mom

6
00:00:18,469 --> 00:00:21,789
If I were likely to say anything about that, that's good. Sorry

7
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:27,960
Charlotte Charlotte are you pregnant?

8
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:33,859
Of course she is and Aaron do you want kids?

9
00:00:37,259 --> 00:00:38,859
I think maybe

10
00:00:38,859 --> 00:00:41,539
Someday, but now isn't the right time

11
00:00:43,549 --> 00:00:45,979
Right. Yeah

12
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:51,500
No, I'm not pregnant. I just went to the doctor and they prescribed me some new medication

13
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:57,060
And I'm just feeling a little nauseous. That's fine then. You better go rest

14
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:05,250
Thanks

15
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:09,379
Aaron, why don't you just say it's not the right time to have children?

16
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:14,900
Because it isn't and Charlotte has to focus on getting the welcome here since

17
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,890
Kids want to help that
