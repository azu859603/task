1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:04,059
Bob, you can't go on like this.

2
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:07,759
He knows our plan and he will find out about you and Adrienne.

3
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:10,929
Just end him.

4
00:00:10,929 --> 00:00:12,929
You will get everything.

5
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:15,310
What are you eating up?

6
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:17,079
Ah!

7
00:00:17,079 --> 00:00:18,870
Oh no!

8
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:22,539
What the hell are you doing?

9
00:00:22,539 --> 00:00:23,609
The...

10
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:27,039
Wait, wait!

11
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,039
Samantha!

12
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:30,039
How could you do this?

13
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:32,039
He was always kind to you.

14
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:33,039
Kind to me!

15
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:42,299
Ain't a fortune.

16
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:43,299
Why?

17
00:00:43,299 --> 00:00:46,350
Nothing!

18
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:48,700
If anyone's to play with Adrienne,

19
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,700
we're being so unfair.

20
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,700
You want to talk about fairness?

21
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,700
Well, you can save it for the police,

22
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:58,789
because we already called them and they're on the way.

23
00:00:58,789 --> 00:00:59,789
How did it come to us?

24
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:01,789
Sir, will you kill everything with us?
