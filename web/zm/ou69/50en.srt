1
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:10,279
What are you doing here? You coming to glow?

2
00:00:10,279 --> 00:00:13,730
I'm here to let you know that Samantha's been arrested.

3
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:15,730
Charlotte, what did you do?

4
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:18,109
Oh, I didn't do anything.

5
00:00:18,109 --> 00:00:21,850
No, she actually got herself into trouble.

6
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:27,850
She's been arrested for embezzlement, conspiracy to murder, among other things.

7
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:29,910
Coldplay bitch.

8
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,909
No, that's you, my dear sister.

9
00:00:33,909 --> 00:00:39,060
The Welt fortune was meant to be mine.

10
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:41,179
As was Aaron.

11
00:00:41,179 --> 00:00:45,179
You know, Samantha always said that my mom and I took everything from you.

12
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:48,659
And actually, it was the other way around.

13
00:00:48,659 --> 00:00:50,659
You took everything from us.

14
00:00:50,659 --> 00:00:52,759
And let's get one thing straight.

15
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:56,109
Aaron? He was always mine.

16
00:00:56,109 --> 00:01:05,200
Wait, Howard, Dad, and Aaron.
