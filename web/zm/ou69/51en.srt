1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,180
Howard, Dad, and Aaron.

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:06,299
I'm surprised you remember you even have a father.

3
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:09,679
Tell me, how is he?

4
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:13,000
Ms. Bolton, your father is asking for you.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Thanks.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,410
Caroline, your schemes didn't work.

7
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:20,820
Good luck with your sentencing.

8
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,530
Oh, and one more thing.

9
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:56,659
Moon!

10
00:00:56,659 --> 00:00:57,659
I'm safe now.

11
00:00:57,659 --> 00:01:02,420
He's at home recovering.

12
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:09,920
But I don't want to leave without you.

13
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:24,500
Do you remember the day we met?

14
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:29,549
I'm so glad I saved you from those guys.

15
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:35,409
Remember I cleaned your face with my handkerchief?

16
00:01:35,409 --> 00:01:37,409
You had no idea who you were.
