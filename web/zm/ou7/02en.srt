1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,609
Ladies and gentlemen, introducing our uniquely fashionable bride.

2
00:00:14,609 --> 00:00:18,809
Mom, control yourself. She must have her reasons.

3
00:00:18,809 --> 00:00:23,410
This is our wedding day, and an important ceremony for the Grayson family.

4
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:25,410
Let's keep our poise.

5
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:34,380
As matriarch, I make the first sacrificial cut.

6
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:41,119
Back on this porch.

7
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:48,659
I'm sorry if I was rude earlier.

8
00:00:48,659 --> 00:00:50,659
I didn't know David had a brother.

9
00:00:50,659 --> 00:00:54,659
I'm sorry, let me formally introduce myself to take the pancreas.

10
00:00:54,659 --> 00:00:58,359
Formal introduction.

11
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:00,359
What? You already had an informal one?

12
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:04,420
Relax, bro. I'm here on a serial murder case.

13
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:06,739
Several clues led me here.

14
00:01:06,739 --> 00:01:10,739
Oh, Julie, your new daughter-in-law is quite different.

15
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:15,739
Growing up in such an unsavory environment, it's not her fault.

16
00:01:15,739 --> 00:01:17,739
She has this taste.

17
00:01:17,739 --> 00:01:21,189
I want to wish you a choke on that cake.

18
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,730
Julie, are you all right?

19
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:28,730
Where'd somebody get her some jolly hoes?

20
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:30,730
Oh, but it's chocolate!
