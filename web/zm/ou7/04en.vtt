00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:06.870
Where are you?

2
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.470
The hideous dress almost suffocated me.

3
00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:13.470
And then they found a dead body at my wedding.

4
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.109
I told you I was against you marrying into this crazy family.

5
00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:19.710
Daven, isn't crazy?

6
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.109
We're very happy.

7
00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:24.460
As long as my daughter's happy.

8
00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:25.420
What happened?

9
00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.500
Why do you look like you just saw a ghost?

10
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:34.030
I have still to be mean about that handsome stranger.

11
00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.729
Mom, I'm actually a kissed him.

12
00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:38.289
No.

13
00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:40.329
He kissed me.

14
00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:43.750
And then it was like I had the power of God.

15
00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:44.829
Vivy?

16
00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:45.390
No, no.

17
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.310
Daven's mom was eating some cake.

18
00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:50.469
And I wish that she would choke on it.

19
00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:52.590
And she did.

20
00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.189
I'm not crazy.

21
00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:57.549
It seems that you've awakened on your birthday.

22
00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:59.710
Awakened?

23
00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.869
Mom, what are you talking about?

24
00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:04.950
Ever wonder why your drinks are always a hit at the bar?

25
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.150
No, that's just me being good at my job.

26
00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.230
Of course you are, but there's more to it than that.

27
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.290
It's one of the many gifts you were born with.

28
00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:23.799
Gifts?

29
00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:29.920
My precious ones.

30
00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.540
Are you tired?

31
00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:32.739
Do you want to take a break?

32
00:01:32.739 --> 00:01:35.780
No, but I could use a kiss.
