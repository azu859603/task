1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
What are you doing, bastard child?

2
00:00:05,419 --> 00:00:07,419
What is wrong with your mom?

3
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,419
Don't worry, it's just a part of her practice.

4
00:00:10,419 --> 00:00:11,419
She'll be fine in a minute.

5
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:13,419
Well, she better be.

6
00:00:14,419 --> 00:00:16,420
Or I'm adding her to my list of suspects.

7
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:19,769
I need to go home.

8
00:00:20,769 --> 00:00:22,019
And talk to my mom.

9
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:26,300
Stay out of this.

10
00:00:29,940 --> 00:01:01,890
I'm a witch.

11
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:02,890
What do I say?

12
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:05,900
I'm a crocodile.

13
00:01:09,049 --> 00:01:11,049
If what I see in the movies is real,

14
00:01:11,049 --> 00:01:13,049
then it should be my birthday.

15
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,560
Twelve.

16
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,560
Twenty-five.

17
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,560
Ninety-four.

18
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:24,730
I mean, it should just open when I say open.
