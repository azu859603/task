00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:05.679
Care to explain what happened you were supposed to bring her to my room for the ritual

2
00:00:05.679 --> 00:00:12.179
I tried but the moment I reached the cabin door my wand lost its power. You're telling me that you're wand a

3
00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:18.660
Wizard King's wand just suddenly stopped working. I swear I was defenseless and

4
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.579
There were some kind of being in there. I think it was a demon

5
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:39.850
Are you telling me the truth? You haven't fallen for that pathetic girl. Have you? Yes

6
00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:44.439
Officer, I have some news about the murder case

7
00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:47.659
And now that I think of it

8
00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:53.630
During the wedding the brides mother did go missing for about two hours

9
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:08.120
I guess they don't teach knocking at the police academy good to know get out of my house

10
00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.560
We're looking for your mother. We're here to come with us

11
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.109
Going on in here. We're looking for Maggie. You're looking right at her

12
00:01:19.099 --> 00:01:22.640
Wait, why are you doing this baby and let them do their work?

13
00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:30.370
So you only got close to me so that you could take my mother away look

14
00:01:30.989 --> 00:01:36.900
Right now you're fairly being targeted until we find the killer jail is the safest place for your mother, okay?

15
00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:47.620
I'm sorry. I slapped you

16
00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:53.379
It's fine. I would have been pissed too. I thought I put my trust in the wrong person

17
00:01:54.379 --> 00:01:56.379
See you finally trust me

18
00:01:56.379 --> 00:02:16.460
Took you long enough. You're right. They're a threat to our plan. We'll do it your way. Let them die together
