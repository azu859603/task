1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,589
I heard your mom got arrested. I waited up for you all night. Are you okay?

2
00:00:10,589 --> 00:00:22,289
I'm better. No. Thanks Hank. He stayed up with me at the precinct. Sorry. I'm really tired. I just need to lie down.

3
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:28,289
Sure. I just think it's too bad. I wasn't the one there for you last night.

4
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:31,289
Who do you think reported my mom as a suspect?

5
00:00:32,539 --> 00:00:37,539
What? Hank did mention that they received a call and had to be someone at the wedding.

6
00:00:37,539 --> 00:00:41,640
Vivian, there's something you should know about Hank.

7
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:49,670
Hank didn't grow up with the gracens because of some issues between my father and his mother.

8
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:53,670
He's always had a habit of taking things from me. Like what?

9
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:58,670
Baseball caps. Even my first girlfriend. No matter what it is,

10
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:02,670
you would always show up around the things that mattered to me.

11
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:17,599
It sounds like Hank has issues. Interesting though that you would refer to your girlfriend's as things.

12
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:21,629
Hey, did you talk to me? Did you mind that you were with me last night?

13
00:01:21,629 --> 00:01:29,260
Why are you so concerned about Davin's feelings? Am I just a pawn and your brotherly feud?

14
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:34,629
Hello?

15
00:01:34,629 --> 00:01:38,629
My princess. That hasn't changed in a thousand years.

16
00:01:38,629 --> 00:01:53,099
I'm downstairs. You have to let me know what's going on.

17
00:01:53,099 --> 00:01:56,099
I promise I could explain everything.

18
00:01:56,099 --> 00:02:01,680
Hey, I didn't think you'd show.

19
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,680
I need you to tell me about Davin's ex-girlfriend.

20
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,680
Are you sure you want to talk here? My cars are annoying.

21
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,680
No. If I don't like what you're saying, I can go right back inside.

22
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,680
Davin's first girlfriend came onto me without even mentioning him.

23
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:16,680
My family, the gracens, they're magical royalty.

24
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:22,680
The gracens legacy stretches on for centuries, a family known for their extraordinary power.

25
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,680
Legend says that the king gets his power from sacrificing his first bride in a dark ritual.

26
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,680
That's insane. How are they allowed to keep doing this?

27
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:36,780
Because mere legend, everything's hidden behind veils and sealed behind doors.

28
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:41,539
What about you? You're a gracen.

29
00:02:41,539 --> 00:02:45,539
Yeah, the illegitimate son had no magical powers.

30
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:49,539
Davin's ex thought that I would be able to help her get what she wanted.

31
00:02:49,539 --> 00:02:51,539
And then she dumped you.

32
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:56,539
Yeah. When she found out I had no powers, I never saw her again.

33
00:02:56,539 --> 00:03:02,900
You don't seem surprised by this whole wizard thing.

34
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:09,219
Why would I be? I'm a witch who can speak her desires into existence.

35
00:03:09,219 --> 00:03:27,810
Well, you have an admirer. Can you at least give me a little smile? A little one? For me?

36
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:33,449
So you happy with me lady witch?

37
00:03:33,449 --> 00:03:53,139
You are my brother-in-law.

38
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:56,139
You must know now that your wedding was a sham.

39
00:03:56,139 --> 00:04:03,210
Well, Davin has been acting different since the wedding, but I can't get into a new relationship while I'm still married to him.

40
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:04,210
So stop your wedding.

41
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,210
No, your wedding was actually a sham.

42
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:09,210
Oh my God! Davin, stop!

43
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:14,210
Gee, in my house with this bastard, you slut.

44
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:17,620
Watch your mouth when you talk to her.

45
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,389
She's my wife.

46
00:04:20,389 --> 00:04:25,389
Always after what's mine. A rat scavenging for crumbs just like your absent mother.

47
00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:28,389
I wasn't ever after anything that was yours. She was never yours.

48
00:04:28,389 --> 00:04:32,389
Your wedding was a demonic ritual in disguise. Did you even want to marry her?

49
00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:35,620
What? Our wedding was a demonic ritual?

50
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:39,620
My family business is none of your concern, outsider.

51
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:43,350
I played it straight with her, unlike you.

52
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:53,180
You're walking away with lies. Sure you won't do this.

53
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,180
What is that?

54
00:04:54,180 --> 00:05:00,529
It's a wizard-dual talisman. In three days, we duel to the death.

55
00:05:00,529 --> 00:05:16,579
Oh. So you do feel pain, big hero?

56
00:05:16,579 --> 00:05:19,769
There's a lot you don't yet understand, Davin.

57
00:05:19,769 --> 00:05:21,769
Oh, you wizards and your secrets.

58
00:05:21,769 --> 00:05:26,769
All wizards know that to inherit power, there has to be a ceremony to sacrifice the bride.

59
00:05:26,769 --> 00:05:29,250
It's no secret.

60
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,250
So my wedding day?

61
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,250
I heard you and Davin were getting married.

62
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:38,339
So I got drunk wanting to cause a distraction, but I ended up kissing you instead.

63
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:41,430
I guess I couldn't help myself.

64
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:45,879
Couldn't help yourself. Sounds like you planned the whole thing.

65
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:46,879
I wouldn't dare.

66
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:50,879
I still remember you telling me about kicking my balls into the back of my throat.

67
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:59,550
Since I can desire things into existence.

68
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:10,230
I'm beginning to feel a touch envy towards you.

69
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:13,899
That was, that was crazy.

70
00:06:13,899 --> 00:06:14,899
Yeah.

71
00:06:14,899 --> 00:06:19,769
The wish-granting witches indeed power.

72
00:06:19,769 --> 00:06:20,769
Who are you?

73
00:06:20,769 --> 00:06:24,769
An ally, much stronger than you foolish son.

74
00:06:24,769 --> 00:06:27,310
Are you here to fight for her?

75
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:31,310
You can have her body for your sacrifice. I only need her power.

76
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:43,910
What are you? How can you absorb a witch's power?

77
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:45,910
Ready to die, bastard.

78
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:48,910
Bring in a wand to a duel, really?

79
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:53,180
Says the person who doesn't have one.

80
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,180
Just like your mother.

81
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,180
Always getting in over your head.

82
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:00,180
I'll leave my mother out of this, she worthless prick.

83
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:06,410
Join her and hell then.

84
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:07,410
Kill yourselves.

85
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:10,410
Make anything that threatens their lives disappear.

86
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:16,449
The legend is true. The chosen witch.

87
00:07:16,449 --> 00:07:22,009
Alright, that's not the duel's over. Leave.

88
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:23,009
Are you hurt?

89
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:26,139
I'm fine. I'm a powerful witch, remember.

90
00:07:26,139 --> 00:07:29,139
Leave in your power, it is astonishing.

91
00:07:29,139 --> 00:07:31,139
There has been very concern.

92
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:34,139
You're concerned about how powerful I am?

93
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:36,189
No.

94
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:40,829
About what others might do to take that power away from you?

95
00:07:40,829 --> 00:07:42,829
Is it me you desire?

96
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:44,829
Or is it my power?

97
00:07:44,829 --> 00:08:14,100
This game when you literally just woke up.

98
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:19,420
Didn't sleep much to begin with.

99
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:29,329
Does this mean where I'm off?

100
00:08:29,329 --> 00:08:43,139
Keep dreaming.

101
00:08:43,139 --> 00:08:45,139
Because I love this dream way too that much.

102
00:08:45,139 --> 00:08:55,259
I'm here to get my things.

103
00:08:55,259 --> 00:08:56,259
You're still my wife.

104
00:08:56,259 --> 00:08:58,259
Our wedding was a demonic ritual.

105
00:08:58,259 --> 00:09:00,259
Find another wife.

106
00:09:00,259 --> 00:09:02,259
Well, look who's back.

107
00:09:02,259 --> 00:09:04,259
The bastard and the cheating wife.

108
00:09:04,259 --> 00:09:06,259
What a perfect match.

109
00:09:06,259 --> 00:09:07,259
Enough, Mom.

110
00:09:07,259 --> 00:09:11,259
As the future wizard king, you'll have your fair share of embarrassment.

111
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:13,259
Might as well get used to it with this...

112
00:09:13,259 --> 00:09:15,360
HAG.

113
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,649
Goodbye, Julie.

114
00:09:17,649 --> 00:09:21,679
Oh, you know that exclusive champagne that you just adore?

115
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:26,679
It's sold at a farm five miles up the road for a fraction of the price.

116
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:29,679
I believe the locals call it Hillbilly Bubbly?

117
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:33,480
Let's be civil, Vivian.

118
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,480
I believe we can make a deal that benefits both of us.

119
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,480
What deal did you have in mind?

120
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,480
They never pressed any charges, right?

121
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:46,929
I tell you what, use your power to help me become the wizard king.

122
00:09:46,929 --> 00:09:48,929
And I'll get your mom out of jail.

123
00:09:48,929 --> 00:09:49,929
Don't listen to their lies.

124
00:09:49,929 --> 00:09:51,929
This has nothing to do with you, Hank.

125
00:09:51,929 --> 00:09:54,929
I'm not going to stand here and let you expose your powers.

126
00:09:54,929 --> 00:09:55,929
You know how dangerous that is.

127
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:58,929
If you weren't a contender for the throne,

128
00:09:58,929 --> 00:10:02,929
then I would buy your act of self-righteousness.

129
00:10:02,929 --> 00:10:03,929
What?

130
00:10:03,929 --> 00:10:06,929
I thought you didn't have any magic powers.

131
00:10:06,929 --> 00:10:07,929
You know what?

132
00:10:07,929 --> 00:10:09,929
This family is nothing but liars.

133
00:10:09,929 --> 00:10:13,429
Vivian, let me explain.

134
00:10:13,429 --> 00:10:14,429
Vivian!

135
00:10:14,429 --> 00:10:27,120
Once, Wizard World, picks you.

136
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,120
You shall never escape.

137
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,120
Get out!

138
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,120
I've had enough of you, you old witch!

139
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,120
Hank!

140
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,600
What are you doing?

141
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,600
What else do you think?

142
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,600
We are Wizard World.

143
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:50,559
Whoever you are, give me one reason not to kill you.

144
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:51,559
Whoa!

145
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:55,149
I thought you were.

146
00:10:55,149 --> 00:10:57,299
Don't.

147
00:10:57,299 --> 00:11:00,299
Oh yeah, and if your path to the throne is secure.

148
00:11:00,299 --> 00:11:04,860
Oh, did I hurt your feelings?

149
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:05,860
That's too bad.

150
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:08,860
I thought Wizard Kings didn't have any feelings.

151
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:13,389
Hey, on that bun me!

152
00:11:13,389 --> 00:11:18,870
Great!

153
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:19,870
What?

154
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:22,870
I know you don't want to help me become king,

155
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:24,870
or probably even see me,

156
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:27,870
but your mother is innocent.

157
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:29,870
Let's go bail her out together.

158
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:31,870
Why should I trust you?

159
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:33,870
You probably shouldn't.

160
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:36,870
But I promise I'm here in good faith.

161
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:47,460
Can you please give me a chance to make it right?

162
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,460
Vivian, what did you promise him?

163
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,460
Relax.

164
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,460
It doesn't matter what she promises me.

165
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,460
You'll never get the throne.

166
00:11:53,460 --> 00:12:07,580
Will you two please just shut up?

167
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:09,870
You let spelled in work.

168
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:43,490
Are you not human?

169
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:45,490
Lives taken by demons can't be revived.

170
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:49,500
Alright.

171
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:53,659
Then I will abuse the prophecy and send this demon back into the abyss.

172
00:12:53,659 --> 00:13:00,100
Then I will abuse the prophecy and send this demon back to the abyss.

173
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:03,259
Ready, add to an vernum, don't nail an ass!

174
00:13:03,259 --> 00:13:16,100
Your powers work on demons?

175
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,100
Do you feel weird after using that curse?

176
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,100
I don't care.

177
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:24,059
If I had known how to handle that demon earlier,

178
00:13:24,059 --> 00:13:26,059
my mother would not be dead.

179
00:13:26,059 --> 00:13:29,500
Great magic.

180
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,200
Comes great side of my soul.

181
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,200
I'm tired of your advice.

182
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,460
I can teach you how to control your magic.

183
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:46,279
Use this.

184
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:49,539
And draw the pentagram from your mother's tarot cards.

185
00:13:49,539 --> 00:13:50,539
Do this.

186
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:54,539
And you can kill whoever or whatever you so desire.

187
00:13:54,539 --> 00:14:07,220
Vivian, is enough of that.

188
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,220
Get lost.

189
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:10,220
I live my own life.

190
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,220
And what are you to me?

191
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,220
Why do you care?

192
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,220
I'm your lover.

193
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:19,929
A lover.

194
00:14:19,929 --> 00:14:21,929
I am alone in this world.

195
00:14:21,929 --> 00:14:29,399
Hey, hot stuff.

196
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:32,139
Why so sad?

197
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:33,139
Why come with us?

198
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:36,139
We've got just what you need.

199
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:38,139
Fine.

200
00:14:38,139 --> 00:14:40,139
Let's go then.

201
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:46,299
Vivian, let's go.

202
00:14:46,299 --> 00:15:00,970
I'm so sorry for everything.

203
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:03,700
It was in your fault, Vivian.

204
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,700
Mom always said, don't rush into getting married.

205
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,700
Don't rush into getting married.

206
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,700
And I did it anyway.

207
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:15,899
Now that she's...

208
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:18,539
There's no way you could have known.

209
00:15:18,539 --> 00:15:20,960
Vivian, I know what you're going through.

210
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,600
I know what it's like to lose a mother.

211
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,600
What happened to your mom?

212
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,820
My family's bound by the rules of wizard loyalty.

213
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:34,629
I was a child born out of wedlock.

214
00:15:34,629 --> 00:15:37,779
And my mom.

215
00:15:37,779 --> 00:15:40,779
She was killed by the wizard king, right?

216
00:15:40,779 --> 00:15:43,200
My dad sacrificed her.

217
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,200
So that he could become king.

218
00:15:45,200 --> 00:16:06,419
Hey, someone anonymously reports that Vivian may have committed murder.

219
00:16:06,419 --> 00:16:08,580
And a state of mental disorder.

220
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:12,080
It's a lie.

221
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,080
Dear you.

222
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,909
What are you doing here?

223
00:16:15,909 --> 00:16:20,809
Vivian, you didn't use that thing.

224
00:16:20,809 --> 00:16:23,840
That thing I gave you yesterday, did you?

225
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,100
What thing?

226
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,129
That thing.

227
00:16:28,129 --> 00:16:34,320
Oh, you mean that old wooden stick that you call a wand?

228
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,320
Old wooden stick.

229
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,320
That's an ancient heirloom.

230
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,320
A treasure of wizard royalty.

231
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,320
I used it as firewood.

232
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,320
One wizard's treasure is another which is trash.

233
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,320
But you had accepted the wand.

234
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,320
It means you still believe in me deep in your heart, doesn't it?

235
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,320
Boss, what are they talking about?

236
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,320
I think we could all see who's having the manic episode here.

237
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:04,319
Detective, will you please remove this trespasser from my home?

238
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:11,339
Is that so?

239
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:15,849
So the victims haven't been identified.

240
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:23,190
The victims have been found in question.

241
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:25,319
Slightly injured in a powerful clay attack.

242
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:28,319
They seem to be thinking they've fallen from drinking too much.

243
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:35,599
That's good news.

244
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:36,599
What are we?

245
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:41,630
Vivian, you have no idea how I worried about you.

246
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:42,630
Worried?

247
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:45,630
You were just trying to frame me.

248
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:47,630
You have to believe me.

249
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:50,630
I was trying to protect you from making a mistake.

250
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:52,630
I will wait for you to understand.

251
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:53,630
Alright, that's enough.

252
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:56,430
You want to wait?

253
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:58,660
You need to know the thousands of years.

254
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,660
Get out.

255
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:03,569
David, no one to quit.

256
00:18:03,569 --> 00:18:04,569
Nobody wants this.

257
00:18:04,569 --> 00:18:09,859
You show yourself.

258
00:18:09,859 --> 00:18:11,859
Now I can avenge my mother's death.

259
00:18:11,859 --> 00:18:13,859
A little girl.

260
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:14,859
You shouldn't hate me.

261
00:18:14,859 --> 00:18:16,859
So you can talk.

262
00:18:16,859 --> 00:18:18,859
Your mother said I was a demon.

263
00:18:18,859 --> 00:18:22,960
Demons only kill witches if they've made a pact.

264
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,960
Then who?

265
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,960
Who did you make a pact with?

266
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,960
That doesn't matter.

267
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,960
What matters is that I'm here to take your life.

268
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,500
What matters is that I'm here to take your life.

269
00:18:35,500 --> 00:19:03,009
The dagger doesn't scare you, but a teeny tiny alcohol swab does?

270
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:07,130
As terrified of losing, you mean more to me than you look.

271
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:20,430
I've been trying to piece together my dreams.

272
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:22,750
My mom said they were my destiny.

273
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,819
Have you come to any conclusions?

274
00:19:24,819 --> 00:19:25,819
No.

275
00:19:25,819 --> 00:19:30,519
After you kissed me at my wedding, my life has been a mess.

276
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:35,849
I dreamt of it before it happened.

277
00:19:35,849 --> 00:19:38,579
It was the same happening to you.

278
00:19:38,579 --> 00:19:40,579
My ancestors were wizards.

279
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:47,259
My past life very well.

280
00:19:47,259 --> 00:20:06,410
I missed you terribly today.

281
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:09,099
Art for a new life.

282
00:20:09,099 --> 00:20:10,099
Feels like century.

283
00:20:10,099 --> 00:20:23,650
We were lovers.

284
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:28,869
I'm sorry.

285
00:20:28,869 --> 00:20:30,319
I...

286
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:31,319
I need to get away.

287
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:32,319
What?

288
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:33,319
Vivian.

289
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:55,839
Love for a thousand years is too much for me.

290
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:58,130
I don't want to get hurt again.

291
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:01,430
I can't wait.

292
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:08,259
I'm quite good at it.

293
00:21:08,259 --> 00:21:11,309
What?

294
00:21:11,309 --> 00:21:13,309
It's a pity you can't kiss on yourself.

295
00:21:13,309 --> 00:21:20,910
You should trust your body.

296
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:21,910
It doesn't lie.

297
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:53,609
Did you really get hurt?

298
00:21:53,609 --> 00:21:56,960
Because you seem strong and don't think now.

299
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,410
Only my pride would fit it.

300
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:23,869
The paper would come early?

301
00:22:23,869 --> 00:22:27,380
It's not the paper.

302
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:37,579
Your prince put the spatula down first.

303
00:22:37,579 --> 00:22:42,700
Your hands are better suited, wrapped around money.

304
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,700
Breakfast could be conjured up with magic.

305
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:51,579
Well, maybe I'll start with dessert.

306
00:22:51,579 --> 00:23:03,069
What's wrong?

307
00:23:03,069 --> 00:23:05,069
A damn letter, cut my hand.

308
00:23:05,069 --> 00:23:18,440
This is a challenge from the Grayson family for you.

309
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,440
A challenge?

310
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,920
Will Devon and Julie ever stop?

311
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,920
I mean, didn't we just have a duel a few days ago?

312
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,210
A duel has winners and losers.

313
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:32,210
A challenge is about life and death.

314
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:38,980
Everyone in the wizard royal family is combative.

315
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:45,539
Peace can never be found in places away from the center of power.

316
00:23:45,539 --> 00:23:49,579
What?

317
00:23:49,579 --> 00:23:54,940
No wonder what?

318
00:23:54,940 --> 00:24:03,470
No wonder Vivian left a thousand years ago to seek the power of true love far away.

319
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:04,470
She had.

320
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:09,880
In the Imperial city, her love was just a foolish joke.

321
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:12,880
Well, putting matters of a thousand years ago aside,

322
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,880
like it's important I stay by your side to keep you safe.

323
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:21,660
Consessive proofs.

324
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,069
Proof of what?

325
00:24:23,069 --> 00:24:26,069
Your cohabitation application.

326
00:24:26,069 --> 00:24:40,609
Okay.

327
00:24:40,609 --> 00:24:46,730
I am going to buckle down and diligently practice my witchcraft.

328
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:48,730
Oh my God.

329
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:52,049
A witch calling out to a god holding a devil's book.

330
00:24:52,049 --> 00:24:54,049
You know, the only one to do so.

331
00:24:54,049 --> 00:25:00,630
I've always been a unique one, haven't I?

332
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:03,630
Vivian, you're talent shine brighter than you ever know.

333
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:06,079
Oh, I thank you, Hank.

334
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:13,529
But I still do not understand what those headache-inducing pentagrams were for at my wedding.

335
00:25:13,529 --> 00:25:14,529
Wait.

336
00:25:14,529 --> 00:25:17,099
That's not right.

337
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:18,099
Not right?

338
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:19,099
What's not right?

339
00:25:19,099 --> 00:25:21,099
The pentagram and the book has a circle around it.

340
00:25:21,099 --> 00:25:24,099
In police files of past pentagram murder serial cases,

341
00:25:24,099 --> 00:25:27,099
there's always a circle around it.

342
00:25:27,099 --> 00:25:30,930
But strangely...

343
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:33,299
What?

344
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:37,299
Strangely, the murder scene at your wedding didn't have a circle around it.

345
00:25:37,299 --> 00:25:41,779
So the killer randomly decided to change his method on a whim?

346
00:25:41,779 --> 00:25:46,039
Maybe the case that your wedding was specifically targeted for you.

347
00:25:46,039 --> 00:25:50,130
They were after me, but why?

348
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:54,130
I mean, I may occasionally kick a random drunk guy at the bar in the nuts,

349
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:57,130
but I haven't even killed a spider.

350
00:25:57,130 --> 00:26:00,319
Because Vivian, you're powerful and unique.

351
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:04,559
I think I'd rather be ordinary.

352
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:07,559
Don't kill yourself, you're far from ordinary.

353
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:10,559
No ordinary bartender would drop kick a drunk guy in the nuts

354
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:13,559
and then rip up her wedding dress and walk out in jeans.

355
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:15,559
You're far from ordinary.

356
00:26:15,559 --> 00:26:18,559
I swear that wedding dress ripped by itself.

357
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:19,619
Right, F.

358
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:32,539
There's something I've been thinking about for a thousand years.

359
00:26:32,539 --> 00:26:34,670
There must be a big thought.

360
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:41,569
Vivian, ages ago, you got the power of true love through sacrifice.

361
00:26:41,569 --> 00:26:44,750
Now you get it from my kiss.

362
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:48,220
Maybe this is just another trap.

363
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:50,220
I don't understand.

364
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:55,490
How can a gift be a trap?

365
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:57,579
Because you could get it on your own.

366
00:26:57,579 --> 00:26:59,579
You don't need any triggers.

367
00:26:59,579 --> 00:27:01,579
Just like you deserve love without anyone's validation.

368
00:27:01,579 --> 00:27:15,119
You have no idea what a jealous of me

369
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:20,009
because I was able to get a grace in you.

370
00:27:20,009 --> 00:27:27,579
But no one has ever told me that I deserved it.

371
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:28,579
You deserve better.

372
00:27:28,579 --> 00:28:01,059
Challenge-driven issues become new.

373
00:28:01,059 --> 00:28:04,059
A challenge is all this ungrateful slung girl needed.

374
00:28:04,059 --> 00:28:07,059
If you had listened to me earlier, she would have been sacrificed already.

375
00:28:07,059 --> 00:28:11,059
I'm not interested in your challenge, Devon.

376
00:28:11,059 --> 00:28:15,059
I'm just here to learn the truth about my mother's death.

377
00:28:15,059 --> 00:28:17,059
I swear I'm completely innocent.

378
00:28:17,059 --> 00:28:23,819
Still, I can't help but resent your magical prowess

379
00:28:23,819 --> 00:28:26,819
and the way my stepbrother stole you.

380
00:28:26,819 --> 00:28:29,819
Everyone has their own unique abilities.

381
00:28:29,819 --> 00:28:32,819
Devon, you have your own strengths.

382
00:28:32,819 --> 00:28:35,819
There is no need to hunger for others.

383
00:28:35,819 --> 00:28:38,910
How profound.

384
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:41,230
I never knew a bar maid could be so wise.

385
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:44,829
Oh, that crewness before just an act.

386
00:28:44,829 --> 00:28:47,930
I'm not here to argue with you.

387
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:53,960
I just want to know why a figure in a black cloak keeps trying to kill me.

388
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,279
I summoned it.

389
00:28:56,279 --> 00:28:58,279
I signed a contract with it.

390
00:28:58,279 --> 00:28:59,279
What?

391
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:03,619
Today, you're both doomed.

392
00:29:03,619 --> 00:29:16,700
How complete, Devon's succession ritual.

393
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:40,579
So fast.

394
00:29:40,579 --> 00:29:43,380
Banish the demon.

395
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:45,859
Or save your true love.

396
00:29:45,859 --> 00:29:51,029
Banish the demon.

397
00:29:51,029 --> 00:29:53,509
Or save your true love.

398
00:29:53,509 --> 00:30:06,210
I always have improved, but you are no match.

399
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:12,400
What did you expect?

400
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:27,710
Mom, how could this be?

401
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:28,710
You.

402
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:31,799
How are you still alive?

403
00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:32,799
Alive.

404
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:34,380
I'm not.

405
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,660
I clawed my way out of hell.

406
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:39,180
Where were you?

407
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,180
How...

408
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:42,819
You became a demon?

409
00:30:42,819 --> 00:30:46,819
Years ago, the old wizard king tricked me into having me.

410
00:30:46,819 --> 00:30:50,259
I didn't know he only wanted a child to sacrifice.

411
00:30:50,259 --> 00:30:53,609
Couldn't let her once I found out.

412
00:30:53,609 --> 00:31:00,460
So they threw me into the fire because they knew I wouldn't let that happen.

413
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:04,460
Crude rivalry is standard among the royal elites.

414
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:07,460
Sadly, your mailing example of what it's like to fail.

415
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:08,460
Respect him.

416
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:11,680
How about you taste if links yourself?

417
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:35,680
Go to hell!

418
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,680
My magic.

419
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:40,019
It's gone!

420
00:31:40,019 --> 00:31:42,059
My mother is dead.

421
00:31:42,059 --> 00:31:45,059
And all of you will join her.

422
00:31:45,059 --> 00:31:46,059
Mom, what are you doing?

423
00:31:46,059 --> 00:31:48,059
Killing the woman behind you.

424
00:31:48,059 --> 00:31:50,059
Her energy will bring me back to life.

425
00:31:50,059 --> 00:31:52,059
I deal with the devil.

426
00:31:52,059 --> 00:31:54,059
Murdering my true love.

427
00:31:54,059 --> 00:31:56,059
Have you ever stopped to think about me?

428
00:31:56,059 --> 00:32:04,480
Your son?

429
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,759
Fine.

430
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:09,849
If I were a mistake, you'd think wish me.

431
00:32:09,849 --> 00:32:12,099
But stay away from Vivian.

432
00:32:12,099 --> 00:32:43,599
Yes.

433
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:47,049
I'd like to report some criminal activity.

434
00:32:47,049 --> 00:33:05,720
Detective Hank, this better be important.

435
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:09,700
What?
