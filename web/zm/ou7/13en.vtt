00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:37.979
Since you're both here, you might as well come in.

2
00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:41.420
Should I call you Linda or Thorne?

3
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:42.420
Thorne.

4
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.439
Gavin's missing ex. Thorne.

5
00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:48.409
Just stick with Linda.

6
00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:49.929
Thorne had a rough history.

7
00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:53.060
No wonder you knew about my jelly allergy.

8
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:54.539
Thorne?

9
00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.299
Davin's ex who you stole?

10
00:00:57.299 --> 00:01:01.380
Don't rush off, Lucky Princess.

11
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:02.780
Lucky.

12
00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.659
Being tricked into marriage and betrayed by my friend is lucky?

13
00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.739
You have no idea what I have to sacrifice to get where I am.

14
00:01:10.739 --> 00:01:13.930
Davin and I were really worried when you disappeared.

15
00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.689
Gavin, that liar.

16
00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:22.250
I give up everything for him and he still told me I could never be his princess.

17
00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.890
If only you knew what it takes to get there.
