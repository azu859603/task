00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960
If only you knew what it takes to get there.

2
00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:06.000
You wouldn't understand what it takes to pursue wizard royalty.

3
00:00:07.679 --> 00:00:12.080
If you're so loyal, then why did you leave Daven to go after Hank?

4
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.300
Didn't you make the exact same choice?

5
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.339
The difference is I'm true to myself.

6
00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:21.179
I don't need to be anyone's princess.

7
00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:35.359
If you don't want it, you should have just let me have it.

8
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.640
It was over between Daven and me long ago.

9
00:00:40.159 --> 00:00:45.969
I don't care about that boring man.

10
00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.250
All I care about is power.

11
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.600
On your wedding night?

12
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.600
I took your place and completed the ritual with him.

13
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:57.840
What?

14
00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:01.090
So you two played me?

15
00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.290
I take what I want by any means necessary.

16
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.250
So you're a thief?

17
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.209
That's not stealing.

18
00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:10.670
What you gave my child was?

19
00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.459
What did you do at the bar that night?

20
00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:18.189
Vivian.

21
00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:19.790
Vivian, this woman's insane.

22
00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:21.069
Yes.

23
00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.909
The wedding ritual was completed with me, but I'm no chosen witch.

24
00:01:27.629 --> 00:01:30.829
So I needed Vivian's pity for some power.

25
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.900
Giving powers taboo for Vivian.

26
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.180
To hell with taboos.

27
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.659
The only thing that should be banned is the royal family.
