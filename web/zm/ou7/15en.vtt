00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.769
So everything between us is fake, you never really truly...

2
00:00:05.769 --> 00:00:18.739
What's your Harry bastard? You haven't asked what's really on your mind.

3
00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:27.550
What? He wants to know if I ever truly like to.

4
00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.549
Don't try and drive a wedge between us, Lino. You could stop the ritual right now. We could still make it happen.

5
00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:36.060
So did you truly like her?

6
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.060
Livia, now is not the time.

7
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:44.060
You said that you searched for me for a thousand years. Why then were you with her?

8
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.060
It's not what it looks like, okay?

9
00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:56.259
Look, I admit that I was frustrated about being a bastard and I wanted to compete with that in.

10
00:00:56.259 --> 00:00:59.259
But I would never intentionally use anyone.

11
00:00:59.259 --> 00:01:05.629
I don't understand how resentment leads to blind relationships.

12
00:01:05.629 --> 00:01:11.060
The allure of power, Livia.

13
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.060
This man will never put love before his own selfish desires.

14
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.060
That's rich coming from you.

15
00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:23.469
I approached you for your royal status. Leaving you was because I found out you had none.

16
00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:28.459
Love was never part of the equation.
