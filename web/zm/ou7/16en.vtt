00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.439
Do you realize how outrageous it is

2
00:00:02.439 --> 00:00:05.940
to abuse love and friendship like this?

3
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.699
Your ex-husband David, the future heir

4
00:00:09.699 --> 00:00:13.740
to the wizard throne, used women in the name of love.

5
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.649
If he could do it, why can't I?

6
00:00:16.649 --> 00:00:20.690
As long as I win, I am the truth.

7
00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:23.050
History is written by its victims.

8
00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.170
How do you plan to win?

9
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.089
By deceiving your friends,

10
00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:29.690
because I will not be fooled by you again.

11
00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:31.300
No matter.

12
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.859
Once I give birth, I will be the mother of the heir.

13
00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:37.539
The last mother of the heir, Julie,

14
00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:40.929
was almost sacrificed by her own son.

15
00:00:40.929 --> 00:00:43.810
Every throne is built on blood.

16
00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:47.630
Even your sweet, charming hank,

17
00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.509
face with power, would turn into a demon

18
00:00:50.509 --> 00:00:54.109
willing to sacrifice you without thinking it once.

19
00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:58.520
My value to my lover is not in my sacrifice.

20
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.880
It is in my presence.

21
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.619
So naive on your part.

22
00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:05.540
As your affection diminishes,

23
00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.219
your own falling will become painfully clear.

24
00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:11.299
You're wrong, Linda.

25
00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:14.219
The real fool is the one who drags others

26
00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:17.180
into their schemes.

27
00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.180
No, no, no.

28
00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.700
What is happening?

29
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.180
Why is this happening?
