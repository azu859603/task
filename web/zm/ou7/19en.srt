1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Who's there? Show yourself.

2
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:08,949
Say here. I'll go.

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,300
Why should we trust you?

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:13,300
Because going up there means certain death.

5
00:00:14,859 --> 00:00:17,359
I went through hell to carry this royal heir.

6
00:00:17,859 --> 00:00:20,859
I should have been dabbing between long ago, but wasn't for her.

7
00:00:20,859 --> 00:00:23,859
You are obsessed with becoming queen.

8
00:00:23,859 --> 00:00:26,859
If Davin can't find you, then Hank is mine. Deal.

9
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:28,550
Now!

10
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:31,839
Come on out.

11
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:33,840
Or I'll set this place ablaze.

12
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,280
Still as hot-tempered as ever.

13
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:41,590
What are you doing here?

14
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:44,100
Securing a future for my child.

15
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,810
Child.

16
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:48,350
Davin, you haven't told them.

17
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:50,670
I'm carrying your heir.

18
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,539
That's no royal heir, that's my path.

19
00:00:53,539 --> 00:00:56,780
So what is it?

20
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:58,780
Exactly that you want.
