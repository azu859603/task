1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,399
So what is it, exactly that you want?

2
00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:05,599
I want to be Davin's rightful queen.

3
00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:06,799
That's impossible.

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:08,300
Why?

5
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,300
It was me who stood by you during the ceremony.

6
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:14,500
And it was me who followed the royal family.

7
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,699
Even the power that this child has, I got from that witch.

8
00:00:18,699 --> 00:00:20,899
I earned the title of queen.

9
00:00:20,899 --> 00:00:23,100
Young lady, the power of the witch is not something

10
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,300
that the wizard royal family is willing to forego easily.

11
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,359
However, should you give birth to the child,

12
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,420
we will gladly extend our favor to you.

13
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:38,020
And if I refuse, if you behave,

14
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:41,979
you might be able to keep the title of the prince's mother.

15
00:00:41,979 --> 00:00:47,570
Otherwise, you will be left with nothing.

16
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:49,969
We've been looking in the wrong place.

17
00:00:49,969 --> 00:00:52,000
What do you mean?

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,600
This whole time that we got Davin and his mother

19
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,600
were responsible for the murders at the wedding,

20
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,140
but we can never find any evidence.

21
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:02,520
What if it wasn't them?

22
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,519
Who else could it be?
