1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Who else could it be?

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,000
She has loved you.

3
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:14,470
Prince, if you refuse to marry me, you will regret it.

4
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:39,590
I can't believe I was jealous of Gavin.

5
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,100
Hmm, of his royal status?

6
00:00:46,509 --> 00:00:49,759
No, jealous of him becoming a father.

7
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:54,960
Do I have any say in this?

8
00:00:56,659 --> 00:00:57,659
Detective, hey.

9
00:00:57,659 --> 00:01:22,140
Look, this better be so important the world's going to explode if I don't do it right now.

10
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:29,739
No, just hold on a minute.

11
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:40,900
Don't, stop. I'll miss you.

12
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:08,370
What's wrong?

13
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:10,370
There's a note here from the Wizard Royal family.

14
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,400
What does it say?

15
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:21,099
It says that the ancestors of the Wizard Royal family once tamed demons.
