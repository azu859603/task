1
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:13,589
Sorry to interrupt your honeymoon.

2
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:15,300
It's fine.

3
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,440
Why is the analysis taking so long?

4
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,039
Is this the evidence you brought from the Grayson ruins?

5
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:21,879
Yeah.

6
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:22,940
We've been there several times and we've

7
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,750
found nothing but broken stones.

8
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:30,339
Well, maybe it was just really well hidden.

9
00:00:30,339 --> 00:00:38,299
Are the results done?

10
00:00:38,299 --> 00:00:48,469
I think I need new glasses.

11
00:00:48,469 --> 00:00:54,719
So, Linda's the murderer.

12
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,679
Her fingerprints were found at several crime scenes.

13
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:00,079
All weddings.

14
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,270
Does she seem to hate weddings or something?

15
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,700
I don't know.

16
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,230
She seems like a good job, man.

17
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:13,459
Let's go.

18
00:01:13,459 --> 00:01:14,819
Vivian.

19
00:01:14,819 --> 00:01:16,099
Congratulations, Vivian.

20
00:01:16,099 --> 00:01:17,620
The evidence has emerged.

21
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:20,489
Even clear of all charges.

22
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:23,010
More like congratulations to Detective Hank

23
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:26,510
for getting his job back.

24
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:31,200
It's all right, man.

25
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,760
First day back, can you still have time to drop me home?

26
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:39,549
For you?

27
00:01:39,549 --> 00:01:44,439
Mm-hmm.

28
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:45,599
It's me, Detective.

29
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:51,680
Stay here, bullets.

30
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,200
What happened?

31
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,040
Normally, it looks like a bear rampaged in through here.

32
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,040
Roll it.

33
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,040
What?

34
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,560
Do you want to make it get bad?

35
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,560
Stop.

36
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,560
I didn't realize you were so bad.

37
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,560
Stop.

38
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,560
No, no.

39
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,560
Stop.

40
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:16,469
I, um, I did a good job cleaning.

41
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:20,550
Since when does Hell's messenger double as a cleaning lady?

42
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,879
Were you waiting for us?

43
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:29,740
I'm here to warn you.

44
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:32,400
What is this?

45
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,219
Is this what Linda really wants?

46
00:02:35,219 --> 00:02:37,219
Linda's extremely dangerous.

47
00:02:37,219 --> 00:02:42,060
The murder at your wedding was the last step of her plan.

48
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,060
What plan?

49
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:47,400
Linda completed this sacrifice and successfully conceived.

50
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,840
The power of Davenen's mother is flown to her.

51
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,960
And she's now the strongest wizard in the world.

52
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,569
And royalty at that.

53
00:02:55,569 --> 00:02:58,360
Be careful.

54
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:03,189
Is it just me or is your mother suddenly seeming human?

55
00:03:03,189 --> 00:03:06,139
Vivian.

56
00:03:06,139 --> 00:03:24,060
She just tried to kill you, didn't she resent her?

57
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,669
What are you thinking about?

58
00:03:26,669 --> 00:03:38,439
I just realized I haven't felt this comfortable in the long time.

59
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:47,669
People in my sadness were in a heat.

60
00:03:47,669 --> 00:03:51,050
The heel with their magic is it.

61
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:52,050
What are you doing?

62
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:53,050
Cut it out.

63
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:54,400
Cool!

64
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,759
Serves you right for not wanting to take off your shirt.

65
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:01,599
Now we both have to change.

66
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:08,169
You can't worry about changing later.

67
00:04:08,169 --> 00:04:10,259
One last thing.

68
00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:13,419
If you are to become a wizard king, you might need this.

69
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:15,770
We'll help off.

70
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:17,850
Maybe a little warning next time.

71
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:20,980
If you don't like this, it will help you against Linda.

72
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:27,220
Without power.

73
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:46,899
I'm starting to think it really sucks to be king.

74
00:04:46,899 --> 00:04:48,949
Don't worry.

75
00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm used to people trying to kill me.

76
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Let's leave.

77
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
What?

78
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,819
Let's leave before things get messier.

79
00:04:57,819 --> 00:05:02,459
We're already on the run to keep you from bringing branded as a fugitive on false charges.

80
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:07,259
Now that your name's cleared, let's just get out of here.

81
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:13,370
But Hank, you have a job here that you love and our memories.

82
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:23,379
You really want to leave all that behind?

83
00:05:23,379 --> 00:05:24,920
Calm down.

84
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,490
It was a misunderstanding.

85
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:31,889
I'm happy Vivian's name is cleared.

86
00:05:31,889 --> 00:05:36,290
A happy wizard prince who wanted me dead.

87
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:38,019
What do you want now?

88
00:05:38,019 --> 00:05:43,269
Vivian, I'm about to become the king.

89
00:05:43,269 --> 00:05:46,689
You don't have to be sacrificed by the royal family anymore.

90
00:05:46,689 --> 00:05:47,689
I...

91
00:05:47,689 --> 00:05:49,819
Commence that.

92
00:05:49,819 --> 00:05:52,850
Just be my queen.

93
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:57,379
If you say yes, you can have anything you want.

94
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:07,100
Can I ask the wizard royal family for a different prince?

95
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,459
He's lying.

96
00:06:08,459 --> 00:06:13,120
Do not trust those wizards.

97
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,519
He's lying.

98
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:17,079
Do not trust those wizards.

99
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:19,600
Vivian, what happened?

100
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,000
Vivian, wake up.

101
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,959
She only suffers when she's with you.

102
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:23,959
Let her go.

103
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:24,959
Damn it.

104
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:25,959
What did you do to her?

105
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:26,959
I'm warning you.

106
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:38,490
You stay away from us.

107
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:40,490
Did you give in that voice?

108
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:41,490
Voice?

109
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:42,519
No.

110
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,160
I didn't hear anything.

111
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,680
What are you talking about?

112
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,680
What voice did you?

113
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:53,480
No, it was my voice except it didn't sound like me now.

114
00:06:53,480 --> 00:07:00,740
It sounded far away like I don't know.

115
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:06,540
Could it be your past self trying to warn you?

116
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,459
We're not leaving.

117
00:07:08,459 --> 00:07:09,459
Why not?

118
00:07:09,459 --> 00:07:10,459
This place is dangerous.

119
00:07:10,459 --> 00:07:15,639
Where else in the world isn't happened to my past self?

120
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:17,959
I need to get back my powers.

121
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:31,769
You're playing with fire, Vivian.

122
00:07:31,769 --> 00:07:32,769
Fair enough.

123
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:38,379
We'll stay here in Batterton to see where the troops land.

124
00:07:38,379 --> 00:07:40,800
Vivian, be my queen.

125
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,319
You'll get closer to the truth than you ever were.

126
00:07:43,319 --> 00:08:27,180
If Vivian has to become a queen to learn the truth, then I officially challenge you to the throne.

127
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:30,430
Your act seems even more vicious than mine.

128
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:32,679
Women.

129
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,970
Hm.

130
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:39,100
With such a tough opponent, are you still going for the throne?

131
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,500
Absolutely.

132
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,500
Just for me.

133
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:49,389
And the throne on one's coveted.

134
00:08:49,389 --> 00:08:53,070
I know you're no longer the closed book I met a few weeks back.

135
00:08:53,070 --> 00:09:00,710
Well, being with you's made me realize I don't have to be shameful of who I truly am.

136
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:10,470
But what exactly is the wizard royal family and if we go for the throne, do we have a chance?

137
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,590
The wizard royal family is ruthless.

138
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:16,830
They sacrifice their own children and witches to trade for demons with power.

139
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:18,629
That seems overly cruel.

140
00:09:18,629 --> 00:09:19,919
Yeah.

141
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:26,480
Unless selfish people who try to rise up by sacrificing others are recognized by the spirits,

142
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,440
and only the cold blooded and merciless can make them few.

143
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,720
Now, something doesn't seem right.

144
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,159
What do you mean?

145
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:38,559
If our memories are correct and a thousand years ago you married a queen who could bless

146
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:43,360
her people, why then should you still need to sacrifice others?

147
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,149
That is strange indeed.

148
00:09:45,149 --> 00:09:46,149
Hm.

149
00:09:46,149 --> 00:09:50,950
Let's stay around here and try and figure out what went wrong with the wizard royal family

150
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:52,470
over the past millennium.

151
00:09:52,470 --> 00:10:01,559
I'm also curious about a queen for a thousand years ago, and what exactly happened to her.

152
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,559
Face Martos Tribon.

153
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:06,519
May time then has lacked us.

154
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:07,519
You crazy woman!

155
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:08,519
What have you done to me?

156
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:13,919
The mighty royal wizard didn't expect to be sacrificed, did he?

157
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:21,230
Face Martos!

158
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:27,090
You are useless to me.

159
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:30,490
Now it's time for my lovely bestie Vivian.

160
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:37,389
I can even smell the unending energy coming sweeter than the money.

161
00:10:37,389 --> 00:10:39,029
Crazy evil middle.

162
00:10:39,029 --> 00:10:42,309
You dare to provoke the chosen one.

163
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:44,309
Your doom is inevitable.

164
00:10:44,309 --> 00:11:07,200
You want some milk?

165
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:12,460
Yeah.

166
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,460
Mm-hmm.

167
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:18,259
King ever rebelled against the absurd idea of sacrifice, not in all those years.

168
00:11:18,259 --> 00:11:23,740
They say that when a prince ascends the wizard royal family bestows upon him and unknown.

169
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,940
Unknown power.

170
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:26,940
From where?

171
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,320
For what?

172
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,320
Oh, bastard.

173
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:34,559
Nobody tells me anything.

174
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:38,799
Does this power force the king to have to make a sacrifice?

175
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:40,539
No.

176
00:11:40,539 --> 00:11:41,539
It's, uh, Vivian.

177
00:11:41,539 --> 00:12:02,149
Not so fast, bastard.

178
00:12:02,149 --> 00:12:10,210
She finished a thousand years ago without warning, and then she vanished into that damn

179
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:11,370
castle.

180
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:14,850
Don't forget that useless and despicable royal family.

181
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:36,539
I will create a new one, also part of the wizard royal family.

182
00:12:36,539 --> 00:12:40,259
I would almost believe in true love.

183
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:41,259
What do you want?

184
00:12:41,259 --> 00:12:44,009
You two just let it go off.

185
00:12:44,009 --> 00:12:45,809
How ridiculous.

186
00:12:45,809 --> 00:12:48,210
My ex talked big.

187
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:52,809
You couldn't protect the queen a thousand years ago, and you still can't protect Vivian

188
00:12:52,809 --> 00:12:57,870
now.

189
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:01,879
Your concern is misguided.

190
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:09,889
Our royal power stems from conquest, not sentiment, wasn't this to our affection for

191
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:14,059
those commoners that led you into our trap?

192
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:21,899
If it was not for the medicine that gave me, I wouldn't have fallen for your scheme.

193
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:23,509
Yes.

194
00:13:23,509 --> 00:13:27,549
I believe it was the elixir I had pursued so fervently.

195
00:13:27,549 --> 00:13:33,549
If we were not consumed by love, how could he have brought harm to his own queen?

196
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:51,309
For me a thousand years ago, it's time to return.

197
00:13:51,309 --> 00:14:31,669
The source of the mysterious royal power that was stolen from you, I bowed to my defeat.

198
00:14:31,669 --> 00:14:32,669
I'm sorry.

199
00:14:32,669 --> 00:14:41,629
It's still worthy of your kiss.

200
00:14:41,629 --> 00:14:46,029
A pure kiss to my lover is the greatest reward there is.

201
00:14:46,029 --> 00:14:49,629
What I feel to protect you.

202
00:14:49,629 --> 00:14:59,960
About magic, and without the rules of fate, a genuine kiss is the symbol of my choice.

203
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:08,990
I love you without ever needing your protection.

204
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:25,429
Vivian, from this moment forward, I would no longer haunt you.

205
00:15:25,429 --> 00:15:31,179
You will write all along, sacrifice as a coward's way.

206
00:15:31,179 --> 00:15:34,929
How will you restore your human form?

207
00:15:34,929 --> 00:15:36,490
I won't.

208
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:42,889
Being the way I am, suits me better than my powerless old self.

209
00:15:42,889 --> 00:15:51,460
I curse you to heal, free of pain, and remain forever the perfect, grimly.

210
00:15:52,460 --> 00:16:10,809
You want to adopt Linda's child?

211
00:16:10,809 --> 00:16:14,809
We are the only ones who know his true identity.

212
00:16:14,809 --> 00:16:20,600
Vivian, you're acting like the queen from a thousand years ago again.

213
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:26,700
I'm still me, and my love for you hasn't changed in a thousand years.

214
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:29,980
Too bad in my house?

215
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:30,980
Oh?

216
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,039
Really?

217
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:37,730
I love you even more than I did a thousand years ago.

218
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:45,299
Wizard princes are known for tricking women.

219
00:16:45,299 --> 00:16:57,899
Honestly, I think the reason that Hank back then lost his queen was because he didn't understand

220
00:16:57,899 --> 00:16:59,899
what love was.

221
00:16:59,899 --> 00:17:05,740
But Hank back then had the courage to marry the woman he liked.

222
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,740
How could he not understand love?

223
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:13,660
I think someone else here doesn't get it.

224
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:16,039
So that's it.

225
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:17,039
You're just upset.

226
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:25,329
I was going to rebuild Grayson before properly proposing to you.

227
00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:27,329
Well, don't think that's a sure yes.

228
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:41,690
My dearest Vivian, I've traveled a thousand years in wrong the vast lands, just to find

229
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:45,690
out that loving someone isn't about admiring a perfect image.

230
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:54,859
I just want the real you to accept the real me.

231
00:17:54,859 --> 00:18:37,920
Can this come true?

232
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:42,920
The only type of love that is stronger than magic is the love for oneself.

233
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:46,269
Finally, I am free.

234
00:18:46,269 --> 00:18:49,299
May you find eternal happiness.
