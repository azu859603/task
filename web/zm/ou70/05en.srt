1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,279
Bitch! Get off me! Get off!

2
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:10,279
Am I in your own business, old man?

3
00:00:10,279 --> 00:00:19,800
Do you know who I am?

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,539
I will rule you in this town with a snap of my fingers.

5
00:00:23,539 --> 00:00:35,229
Are you okay?

6
00:00:35,229 --> 00:00:38,229
Thank you. I appreciate you stepping in.

7
00:00:38,229 --> 00:00:43,280
No woman should be treated the way you were, Becca.

8
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,929
Always make sure you're okay.

9
00:00:48,929 --> 00:00:49,929
Alright?

10
00:00:49,929 --> 00:00:57,210
I'm gonna remove the trash.

11
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:03,049
Party's over! Chop top!

12
00:01:03,049 --> 00:01:16,420
They said you made my dad kick up everyone for no reason.

13
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:18,519
Are you serious, Tally?

14
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:21,519
Out of all the years you've known me, what part of that makes any sense?

15
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:23,900
Fucking attacked me!

16
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:27,900
He tried to force himself on me after I repeatedly told him I wasn't interested.

17
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,900
I don't believe you.

18
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:34,640
He's a really nice guy and comes from a very wealthy family.

19
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,640
Are you fucking serious?

20
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,640
No, Becca!

21
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,640
I'm really getting sick and tired of you ruining everything.

22
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,640
It's like you can't stand anyone being happy.
