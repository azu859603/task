1
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,119
Becca, dad told me what happened.

2
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:18,589
The guy was just drunk. He's a really good guy.

3
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:22,109
I'm a good guy that assaults other people on a whim.

4
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:26,109
Talia, I told you no. Why can't you just listen to me?

5
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:30,620
After everything I went through with Chad, you know how I feel about being with another man.

6
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,219
It's okay. I'm just on timeout right now. That's all.

7
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,399
Let's go to the beach and move the party there.

8
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,700
I was just attacked, Talia.

9
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:45,729
Decreased the drama, Becca.

10
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:14,129
What do you want?

11
00:01:40,739 --> 00:01:42,659
Anytime you need something, all you have to do is ask.

12
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:47,420
You know where my office is. We'll help you in any way.
