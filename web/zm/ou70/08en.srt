1
00:00:01,419 --> 00:00:03,419
What do you want to use?

2
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:05,419
What does that even mean?

3
00:00:05,419 --> 00:00:07,419
Like, 1920s, like, she looks in a braille on.

4
00:00:07,419 --> 00:00:09,419
That's just a lot of parties with us.

5
00:00:09,419 --> 00:00:10,419
Okay.

6
00:00:10,419 --> 00:00:17,510
It's a chat call.

7
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:18,510
Hey, gorgeous.

8
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:20,539
What are you doing?

9
00:00:20,539 --> 00:00:21,539
Why do you care, Chad?

10
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:22,539
You cheated on me.

11
00:00:22,539 --> 00:00:24,539
Don't be like that, Becca.

12
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:26,539
I missed you.

13
00:00:26,539 --> 00:00:28,539
Listen, I was an idiot before.

14
00:00:28,539 --> 00:00:31,539
But I wanted to let you know I'm coming to Miami for you.

15
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:37,700
What a chat, Mom.

16
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,700
So let me know he's coming to town.

17
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,700
And he wants to see me because he misses me.

18
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:43,700
He missed you?

19
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:47,820
Don't do it, Becca.

20
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:48,820
I mean, he's hurt you once.

21
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,820
He's going to do it again.

22
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:51,820
You want my opinion?

23
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,820
Stay far away from him.

24
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,820
It's obvious some other girls claiming him now.

25
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:00,149
You need some drinks.

26
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:11,359
You're starving.

27
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:18,019
Yeah.

28
00:01:18,019 --> 00:01:19,379
Oh, I don't want that.

29
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:21,879
Alright, sit.

30
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:22,879
Sit.

31
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:23,879
Sit.

32
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:26,299
It burns.

33
00:01:26,299 --> 00:01:27,299
It burns.
