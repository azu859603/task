00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,830
Come in. Mr. Valentino, did you finish signing the J-Bird report? Yes. Here we go.

2
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:23,730
Thank you. Yes, sweetie. I'm going shopping, daddy. Remember mom's birthday soon.

3
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,309
Can I have the A-key daddy? I want to take back in some friends to the keys.

4
00:00:27,309 --> 00:00:31,829
Catherine said she can drop by in her way home and pick up the key. Sure sweetie

5
00:00:31,829 --> 00:00:43,590
enjoy her shopping. You said Catherine? I have to pick up the key. She needs to

6
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:55,399
learn her way around the city. Good morning. I'm here to pick something up from

7
00:00:55,399 --> 00:01:03,840
Mr. Valentino. Name? Becca Woods. He's expecting me. Right, of course he is. I

8
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:12,439
don't see an appointment so unfortunately you can't see him. Of course I don't have

9
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:17,439
an appointment. I'm picking something up. Not having a meeting. Can you just call

10
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:22,319
him and let him know that I'm here? Do you know how many women we get coming in

11
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:26,400
here trying to get up and see him? You are just like the others. I need to learn

12
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:35,569
to leave him alone. His taste is way above what you obviously are. Excuse me. I'll leave

13
00:01:35,569 --> 00:01:39,170
now or I'll have you thrown out.
