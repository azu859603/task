1
00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.080
We have now. We'll have you thrown out.

2
00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:09.660
Very well.

3
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.939
From now on, no questions asked.

4
00:00:13.939 --> 00:00:17.289
To walk straight up even if I'm in the meeting.

5
00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:18.289
Do you understand me?

6
00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:28.379
Yes, sir.

7
00:00:28.379 --> 00:00:30.379
Well, I have few here. I wanted to speak with you.

8
00:00:30.379 --> 00:00:31.379
About what?

9
00:00:31.379 --> 00:00:34.630
Do I make you nervous?

10
00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.270
Nervous?

11
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:46.909
You've been avoiding me.

12
00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:56.909
I don't think so.

13
00:00:56.909 --> 00:00:57.909
But I think so.

14
00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:19.390
I'm so excited.

15
00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:20.390
I love you.

16
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.450
What is he doing here?

17
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.420
Yeah.

18
00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.319
What is he doing here?

19
00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:31.319
Why did you invite him?

20
00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:34.340
He's staying with Dallas.

21
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.340
And what I can't just expect Dallas to leave his guest at home.

22
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.340
Talia, are you being serious right now?

23
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.879
I wouldn't bother coming.

24
00:01:43.879 --> 00:01:45.879
Had I known he was going to be here.

25
00:01:45.879 --> 00:01:48.230
You should know better.

26
00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.359
Becca, we're all adults here.

27
00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:53.359
I think you could maybe just ignore him and not ruin the weekend.

28
00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:56.950
Is everything okay here?

29
00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:13.099
Becca, will you wait?

30
00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:15.099
Let go of me, Chad.

31
00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:16.099
Don't I look at this.

32
00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:17.099
I told you I was sorry.

33
00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:18.099
I came here for you.

34
00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:21.099
Bullshit, you came here for yourself and I don't want anything to do with you.

35
00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:22.099
Let go of me.

36
00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:23.099
Becca, when you talk, okay?

37
00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.099
I hate when you act hysterical like this.

38
00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:28.349
Becca, what is going on here?

39
00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:33.389
Let go of her.

40
00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:35.620
What is going on here?

41
00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:36.620
Let go of her.

42
00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.900
Hey, I'm just talking to my girl, okay?

43
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.090
You know how women can be when they're upset?

44
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.090
You need to leave this area off the boat right now and have better not see you again.

45
00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:59.889
Was that your ex?

46
00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:02.530
I mean, yeah, he is.

47
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.259
Not that it honestly matters to anyone.

48
00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:07.259
It matters to me.

49
00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:08.259
Why is he here?

50
00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:09.419
Tally.

51
00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:18.219
I take it she's well aware of everything that happened between you and this man.

52
00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:19.639
Yeah.

53
00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:21.900
It doesn't matter though, I'm leaving.

54
00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.900
I want you here.

55
00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:29.180
I will handle it.

56
00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:30.889
Get some rest.

57
00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:34.389
What do you want?

58
00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:55.620
Tally.

59
00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:11.919
Oh my god, did Becca complain to you?

60
00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:13.080
No, she didn't.

61
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:18.069
I caught a man handling her in her room as she screamed at him to leave her alone.

62
00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:26.100
When he complained she was his and they were just arguing.

63
00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.100
You bring mother into this.

64
00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.100
You're the reason everything's fucked up, not her.

65
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:46.410
And if you used her and you left her.

66
00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.410
Otherwise a belief is ass in the case.

67
00:04:48.410 --> 00:05:05.310
My feelings.

68
00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.470
I was thinking you'd hang out on the beach.

69
00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:12.420
Come and join us, please.

70
00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.730
Sure.

71
00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:15.730
I'll be out there shortly.

72
00:05:15.730 --> 00:06:02.529
Hey, I'm Tally.

73
00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:03.529
Sorry, I know you're busy.

74
00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:06.620
I saw you leave the yacht.

75
00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:11.199
I was just wondering if you had a few minutes to talk.

76
00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:17.480
I saw Chad and this blonde going to a bungalow and I don't know why I'm reacting like this.

77
00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:21.819
I just... it hurts.

78
00:06:21.819 --> 00:06:28.470
Yeah, sure, because I'm the one ruining everything.

79
00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:34.579
Yeah, I'm at the bonfire.

80
00:06:34.579 --> 00:06:37.110
I...

81
00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:47.560
Anytime you need something, all you have to do is ask.

82
00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:48.560
Becca, what's wrong?

83
00:06:48.560 --> 00:07:08.160
Please tell me what's wrong with you.

84
00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.160
Make me forget James, please.

85
00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.930
Do you understand what you're requesting?

86
00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:15.699
Yeah, yeah, I do.

87
00:07:15.699 --> 00:07:17.699
There's no going back up.

88
00:07:17.699 --> 00:07:21.420
That's exactly what I want.

89
00:07:21.420 --> 00:08:10.279
And before you came to see me, why were you so upset?

90
00:08:10.279 --> 00:08:18.879
Chad, periosits overwhelming.

91
00:08:18.879 --> 00:08:23.899
I'm noticing more fatality has been acting and I don't agree with it.

92
00:08:23.899 --> 00:08:27.860
I know I lost my best friend and...

93
00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:34.779
As for the boy.

94
00:08:34.779 --> 00:09:04.059
You know, Tally, your dad's, like, super hot.

95
00:09:04.059 --> 00:09:06.539
Really?

96
00:09:06.539 --> 00:09:13.879
Because when Toni and I walked down the boat the first night here and we got lost looking for our room, we heard him.

97
00:09:13.879 --> 00:09:17.419
He was fucking the shit out of some girl.

98
00:09:17.419 --> 00:09:20.419
And she was, like, screaming his name over and over again.

99
00:09:20.419 --> 00:09:27.769
What are you talking about?

100
00:09:27.769 --> 00:09:30.799
It literally said Master Sweet on the door, Tally.

101
00:09:30.799 --> 00:09:45.730
If he didn't bring anyone there, then that means he's fucking one of your friends.

102
00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:46.730
Yeah?

103
00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:51.019
Think about Tally Mom.

104
00:09:51.019 --> 00:09:54.860
Really think he slept with someone?

105
00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:58.179
Look, you do whatever you think you should do.

106
00:09:58.179 --> 00:09:59.179
They're your parents.

107
00:09:59.179 --> 00:10:02.179
If you want to stir the pot, then so be it.

108
00:10:03.179 --> 00:10:07.779
You're one to talk about stirring the pot after the shit on the boat.

109
00:10:07.779 --> 00:10:13.330
Don't think I forgot about the drama you pulled with Chad and then getting my dad involved.

110
00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:24.080
You heard me! Did you sleep with one of my friends this weekend?

111
00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:25.080
People heard you!

112
00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:32.990
It did, didn't you?

113
00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:36.950
Why could you do this to Mother?

114
00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:38.950
Your mother and I are divorced. Nothing I do concerns her.

115
00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:42.950
And you will do your best to remember that and stay out of my affairs in the future.

116
00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:46.320
Okay, I'll tell you.

117
00:10:46.320 --> 00:11:01.990
It seems we had an audience over the weekend.

118
00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:03.990
What are we going to do about that?

119
00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:05.990
We will not do anything.

120
00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:16.580
Let Tally go around to the last person she'll suspect is you.

121
00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:45.350
Mr. Valentina?

122
00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:53.659
Good morning, Tally. Have we day, ladies?

123
00:11:53.659 --> 00:12:06.320
Forget brunch, Becca.

124
00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:07.320
We're going to lunch.

125
00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:44.139
Goodness, sweetie. You have grown.

126
00:12:44.139 --> 00:12:49.299
You're not that same plump little girl with glasses and uncapped hair anymore.

127
00:12:49.299 --> 00:12:51.820
You'd be correct.

128
00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:57.259
It also looks like you got to makeover the doctor's office.

129
00:12:58.509 --> 00:13:00.509
Do they have talented surgeons down here?

130
00:13:00.509 --> 00:13:06.149
Yes, actually they do, and I would be more than happy to set you up.

131
00:13:06.149 --> 00:13:12.149
Oh, no, thank you. I actually prefer more of a natural look, but I appreciate the offer.

132
00:13:12.149 --> 00:13:16.149
Okay, so anyway, Mommy, I have to tell you something that I found out the other day.

133
00:13:16.149 --> 00:13:23.600
Well, Daddy took us on the yacht this past weekend, and a few of the other girls on the boat were saying that two of the guests

134
00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:28.600
overheard Daddy fucking one of my friends.

135
00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:31.820
Why would he do this to me?

136
00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:36.940
What have I done to deserve to be treated like this?

137
00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:38.940
I know, it's absolutely horrible.

138
00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:43.940
Becca and I were trying to figure out who did it, but we're both so disgusted by it.

139
00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:49.940
To think one of those little bitches that I invited is or was fucking Daddy.

140
00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:55.980
Did you do it?

141
00:13:55.980 --> 00:14:03.899
Becca didn't do it.

142
00:14:03.899 --> 00:14:06.899
He barely looks at her, also just because there was another daughter.

143
00:14:06.899 --> 00:14:09.899
Trust me, I would know if Becca was fucking Daddy.

144
00:14:09.899 --> 00:14:19.169
Do you think you know your friends that well?

145
00:14:19.169 --> 00:14:27.830
So you're telling me Tally took you to lunch with her mother?

146
00:14:27.830 --> 00:14:34.779
Yeah, unless you say she doesn't like me one bit.

147
00:14:34.779 --> 00:14:38.480
I forgot how much of a bitch she really is.

148
00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:40.480
What did she say she was going to do?

149
00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:43.600
Did you tell her it was you?

150
00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:46.179
Oh, of course not.

151
00:14:46.179 --> 00:14:49.429
That's only going to cause complications.

152
00:14:49.429 --> 00:14:59.340
It doesn't seem to give a shit about you.

153
00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:01.340
It uses you when it's convenient.

154
00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:09.610
I think so.

155
00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:33.700
I will have you fired at once.

156
00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:37.009
James, she wouldn't let me see you.

157
00:15:37.009 --> 00:15:39.009
What are you doing here, Katrina?

158
00:15:39.009 --> 00:15:40.009
I told you not to come back.

159
00:15:40.009 --> 00:15:45.700
I know you didn't mean that, my love.

160
00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:48.700
I missed you and I'm tired of fighting.

161
00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:49.700
There is no fighting.

162
00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:51.700
You need to leave and not come back.

163
00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:53.700
I don't want you harassing my employees.

164
00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:54.700
Who is that girl?

165
00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:57.340
She knew fuck toy.

166
00:15:57.340 --> 00:15:59.340
Don't ex stupid.

167
00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:02.340
The girl that just came down here like ten minutes ago.

168
00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:05.009
You know how many women work in this building?

169
00:16:05.009 --> 00:16:08.009
I have no clue who you're referring to.

170
00:16:08.009 --> 00:16:12.129
But even if I was seeing someone, I knew business.

171
00:16:12.129 --> 00:16:13.129
So leave.

172
00:16:13.129 --> 00:16:20.330
I won't form a father about your choice.

173
00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:35.509
Alison, what are you doing here?

174
00:16:35.509 --> 00:16:37.509
You know you're not welcome on my property anymore.

175
00:16:37.509 --> 00:16:39.509
Come on, James. Don't be like that.

176
00:16:39.509 --> 00:16:42.539
No, I'm being serious. Why are you here?

177
00:16:42.539 --> 00:16:43.539
To get our daughter.

178
00:16:43.539 --> 00:16:45.539
We're going away for the week.

179
00:16:45.539 --> 00:16:46.539
To Orlando.

180
00:16:46.539 --> 00:16:47.539
For a fashion show.

181
00:16:47.539 --> 00:16:49.059
Okay.

182
00:16:49.059 --> 00:16:51.629
So back on Talia getting ready then.

183
00:16:51.629 --> 00:16:57.070
That little bitch isn't going anywhere near me.

184
00:16:57.070 --> 00:16:59.230
What's your mouth, Alison?

185
00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:04.410
She grew up with her daughter in this house in this Talia's guest.

186
00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:07.410
I don't understand what you issue us with her.

187
00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:11.410
Because she's a freeloader that doesn't deserve our daughter's attention.

188
00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:17.700
So why don't you do your daughter a kindness and get rid of her before Talia gets back?

189
00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:18.700
It will be good for everyone.

190
00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:27.759
I heard about your little fuck toy down at the trip from the keys.

191
00:17:27.759 --> 00:17:29.759
Perhaps we should go back to court.

192
00:17:29.759 --> 00:17:32.759
Because I think you still owe me way more money than you've given me.

193
00:17:32.759 --> 00:17:35.819
I don't owe you shit.

194
00:17:35.819 --> 00:17:40.589
You got everything you wanted into divorce agreement and it's over.

195
00:17:40.589 --> 00:17:50.430
You can't get anything else.

196
00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:52.430
Please do this for me.

197
00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:55.849
I'm not going to spy on your dad for you.

198
00:17:55.849 --> 00:17:57.849
Not for once in your life.

199
00:17:57.849 --> 00:18:59.099
Can you do something for me?

200
00:18:59.099 --> 00:19:00.099
James?

201
00:19:00.099 --> 00:19:03.319
Look at these heels.

202
00:19:03.319 --> 00:19:07.369
I think we're going to get close.

203
00:19:07.369 --> 00:19:08.369
Here we go.

204
00:19:08.369 --> 00:19:09.369
Oh no.

205
00:19:09.369 --> 00:19:11.009
What are you doing?

206
00:19:11.009 --> 00:19:12.009
I have money.

207
00:19:12.009 --> 00:19:13.230
I know you do.

208
00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:17.230
However, I was the one who asked you to come on this trip and I want to be the one to spoil you.

209
00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:23.480
Maybe you want to tell others you paid for it you can but I'm the only one spending money.

210
00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:26.480
Well, I will show you my appreciation.

211
00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:36.009
I have no doubt that you will.

212
00:19:36.009 --> 00:19:39.250
One second.

213
00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:40.250
Natalie.

214
00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:49.309
Yeah?

215
00:19:49.309 --> 00:19:51.759
I think she's lying to me.

216
00:19:51.759 --> 00:19:55.019
Why would you think Becca is lying to you?

217
00:19:55.019 --> 00:20:00.019
Because I called her dad and he said that she wasn't there.

218
00:20:00.019 --> 00:20:04.019
And she told me that she was going to stay home with family but she isn't there.

219
00:20:04.019 --> 00:20:07.750
Perhaps she had different families she was going to see?

220
00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:08.750
I don't know.

221
00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:13.490
I'm out of town for business right now overseas so there isn't much I can do.

222
00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:20.059
I invited her to come stay at our house for the entire summer and she doesn't even bother

223
00:20:20.059 --> 00:20:23.059
to let me know what she's doing when she's out in her house.

224
00:20:23.059 --> 00:20:27.420
Tilly Anna, enough you young lady disappeared on her many times if you recall.

225
00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:30.859
And I'm not tailoring you acting like this.

226
00:20:30.859 --> 00:20:33.859
Perhaps if you started being a better friend to her she'll be open with you.

227
00:20:33.859 --> 00:20:35.630
Okay?

228
00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:36.630
I have to go.

229
00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:40.259
Shall we?

230
00:20:40.259 --> 00:20:59.380
You can't fix everything James.

231
00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:02.890
You underestimate me.

232
00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:04.890
I leave in a few weeks.

233
00:21:04.890 --> 00:21:07.809
Whoa.

234
00:21:07.809 --> 00:21:14.500
Who's considering the idea of you transferring to university here?

235
00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:16.500
As flattering as that is James.

236
00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:22.779
Yale is everything to me and I plan on finishing it there to move her relationship.

237
00:21:22.779 --> 00:21:43.500
It's wonderful to see you but we're heading out.

238
00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:48.519
This is the girl from your office.

239
00:21:48.519 --> 00:21:50.519
I thought you didn't know her.

240
00:21:50.519 --> 00:21:52.319
No, no.

241
00:21:52.319 --> 00:21:53.319
This is my daughter's friend.

242
00:21:53.319 --> 00:21:56.319
She and I are discussing a surprise for Tilly.

243
00:21:56.319 --> 00:22:12.420
You do remember my daughter don't you?

244
00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:14.609
So, what are you talking about?

245
00:22:14.609 --> 00:22:17.609
I mean exactly as I said James.

246
00:22:17.609 --> 00:22:19.609
It's not like we're a couple.

247
00:22:19.609 --> 00:22:23.609
Plus I'll be laving in a few weeks to go back to school so it's simply fun while it lasts.

248
00:22:23.609 --> 00:22:30.700
Are you seriously going to stand here and act like the things that have been going on between us aren't affecting you?

249
00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:38.589
Are you going to say that they've been affecting you?

250
00:22:38.589 --> 00:22:43.700
Becca, I already explained.

251
00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:45.700
I have no interest in extending our contract.

252
00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:49.150
You've had a wonderful past 20 years together.

253
00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:52.180
But I believe it's time we go our separate ways.

254
00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:53.730
Tell you what.

255
00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:56.859
Let's talk about something else that's been on my mind.

256
00:22:56.859 --> 00:22:59.559
My daughter Kichilling.

257
00:22:59.559 --> 00:23:02.700
What about her?

258
00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:07.150
We both know she can be a difficult girl.

259
00:23:07.150 --> 00:23:11.710
Well, I communicated from the beginning.

260
00:23:11.710 --> 00:23:14.710
I'm not interested in a serious relationship.

261
00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:16.059
She knew that.

262
00:23:16.059 --> 00:23:17.059
And agreed.

263
00:23:17.059 --> 00:23:20.059
When I told her I didn't want to see her anymore.

264
00:23:20.059 --> 00:23:23.160
Because I didn't want to give her the wrong idea.

265
00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:25.960
She didn't want to accept that.

266
00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:30.150
So you can just use her and not care about her feelings?

267
00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:32.500
This is what I'm saying, you know.

268
00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:35.920
We slept together on and off for a couple of months.

269
00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:36.920
It wasn't even consistent.

270
00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:40.920
And through that time I have proof she had other lovers.

271
00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:43.690
Just none there were like me.

272
00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:46.519
She seemed fine when she left here.

273
00:23:46.519 --> 00:23:51.750
But missing the point, James.

274
00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:57.240
She is unhappy.

275
00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:02.140
Which means I am unhappy.

276
00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:12.430
So, I heard something new.

277
00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:15.549
The trip overseas.

278
00:24:15.549 --> 00:24:21.680
You take my daughter back.

279
00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:22.680
Marry her.

280
00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:23.680
Make her happy.

281
00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:26.059
I will forget contracts.

282
00:24:26.059 --> 00:24:29.059
And we will be fine.

283
00:24:29.059 --> 00:24:46.960
It's good to know that young woman you went to dinner with last night isn't actually dating you.

284
00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:48.960
She's a price to be one for sure.

285
00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:52.019
I wonder if she's seen anyone.

286
00:24:52.019 --> 00:24:55.299
But perhaps she has time for an old man like me.

287
00:24:55.299 --> 00:25:06.079
Today we are expecting sunny skies.

288
00:25:06.079 --> 00:25:08.079
To make this right with you.

289
00:25:08.079 --> 00:25:09.079
Get out.

290
00:25:09.079 --> 00:25:11.079
You have no right to tell me what to do.

291
00:25:11.079 --> 00:25:12.079
Okay.

292
00:25:12.079 --> 00:25:13.079
Do you know who I am?

293
00:25:13.079 --> 00:25:15.079
Do you know how many people line up?

294
00:25:15.079 --> 00:25:16.079
Just spend the night with me.

295
00:25:16.079 --> 00:25:18.079
You're over here being what I'm grateful.

296
00:25:18.079 --> 00:25:21.329
Love me back out.

297
00:25:21.329 --> 00:25:23.329
I suppose I'll have to show you what it is you're missing.

298
00:25:23.329 --> 00:25:24.329
Jeff.

299
00:25:24.329 --> 00:25:44.619
Mecha.

300
00:25:44.619 --> 00:25:51.460
He was watching TV and then Chad.

301
00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:52.460
Chad.

302
00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:54.710
Chad did this.

303
00:25:54.710 --> 00:26:10.240
Frank.

304
00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:11.430
Fight Chad.

305
00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:31.670
I can't wait to tell Tally.

306
00:26:31.670 --> 00:26:32.670
She's gonna flip.

307
00:26:32.670 --> 00:26:35.670
He wearing her supposed best friend is fucking her father.

308
00:26:35.670 --> 00:26:42.799
Why to give you an easy way out.

309
00:26:42.799 --> 00:26:47.240
You don't learn to you.

310
00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:51.480
Man, I was just I was fucking around.

311
00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:52.480
Let me go.

312
00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:53.480
Okay.

313
00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:55.480
I know you wouldn't sleep with that stupid bitch.

314
00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:56.480
She's beneath you.

315
00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:57.480
Frank.

316
00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:59.480
He just keeps singing himself a deeper hold.

317
00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:02.410
She doesn't deserve you.

318
00:27:02.410 --> 00:27:27.279
Okay.

319
00:27:27.279 --> 00:27:31.380
Just give me a hug.

320
00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:33.819
Pat, isn't it?

321
00:27:33.819 --> 00:27:34.819
I want you not to, didn't you?

322
00:27:34.819 --> 00:27:38.779
Don't I can't do this anymore.

323
00:27:38.779 --> 00:27:39.779
Excuse me.

324
00:27:39.779 --> 00:27:40.779
You're not leaving me.

325
00:27:40.779 --> 00:27:41.779
This was for you.

326
00:27:41.779 --> 00:27:43.779
To get you the retribution you deserve.

327
00:27:43.779 --> 00:27:51.180
For me?

328
00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:53.240
How could you let yourself do something like that?

329
00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:55.240
Because no one touches what's mine.

330
00:27:55.240 --> 00:28:10.539
I wanted to tell you.

331
00:28:10.539 --> 00:28:11.539
I did.

332
00:28:11.539 --> 00:28:12.539
I want this.

333
00:28:12.539 --> 00:28:24.549
Don't you.

334
00:28:24.549 --> 00:28:25.680
It's just sex.

335
00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:26.680
She's the adult and we were both bored.

336
00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:27.680
There's nothing more to this.

337
00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:30.680
So just stop acting like you have done the same before.

338
00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:34.190
So you're telling me she means nothing to you.

339
00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:38.210
You don't care about her?

340
00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:39.269
Of course.

341
00:28:39.269 --> 00:28:44.859
She knows it's just sex.

342
00:28:44.859 --> 00:28:45.859
I'm done, James.

343
00:28:45.859 --> 00:28:47.240
Fuck you both.

344
00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:59.740
I'm all over.

345
00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:00.740
Open up.

346
00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:01.740
It's me.

347
00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:28.109
We need a talk.

348
00:29:28.109 --> 00:29:29.980
Thank you for letting us.

349
00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:30.980
We need all that to thank me.

350
00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:33.980
Just put your stuff in the room down the hall with the blue walls.

351
00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:34.980
Come out when you're ready.

352
00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:37.130
I like her up.

353
00:29:37.130 --> 00:29:49.680
Where is she?

354
00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:50.680
Becca.

355
00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:52.839
She was here but she left about an hour ago.

356
00:29:52.839 --> 00:29:55.839
She just put some stuff down so she didn't want to carry anything around.

357
00:29:55.839 --> 00:29:58.740
She left after that.

358
00:29:58.740 --> 00:29:59.740
I have no idea where she went.

359
00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:02.759
If she comes back, will you call and let me know?

360
00:30:02.759 --> 00:30:03.759
No.

361
00:30:03.759 --> 00:30:04.759
I won't.

362
00:30:04.759 --> 00:30:06.079
Not after what happened.

363
00:30:06.079 --> 00:30:07.079
I'm not getting involved in this, James.

364
00:30:07.079 --> 00:30:09.079
You're going to have to figure this out yourself.

365
00:30:09.079 --> 00:31:51.630
I mean, I love you to death, but you fucked up.

366
00:31:51.630 --> 00:31:53.339
Thank God.

367
00:31:53.339 --> 00:31:54.339
I wanted you to meet someone.

368
00:31:54.339 --> 00:31:57.339
This is my brother new.

369
00:31:57.339 --> 00:32:11.269
That you guys were going to be here.

370
00:32:11.269 --> 00:32:14.299
I hope I'm not intruding on any plans.

371
00:32:14.299 --> 00:32:15.849
It's settled.

372
00:32:15.849 --> 00:32:16.849
Fuck James.

373
00:32:16.849 --> 00:32:18.849
You're joining us tonight.

374
00:32:18.849 --> 00:32:20.849
I don't have anything to wear.

375
00:32:20.849 --> 00:32:22.619
I got it.

376
00:32:22.619 --> 00:33:09.309
Are you enjoying yourself?

377
00:33:09.309 --> 00:33:12.880
May I have the next dance?
