00:00:11,789 --> 00:00:17,160
Good morning, beautiful.

2
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:22,579
Where are we?

3
00:00:22,579 --> 00:00:23,579
My apartment.

4
00:00:23,579 --> 00:00:31,420
I figured you wouldn't want to go back to my place, considering Talia's there.

5
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:35,740
And you were adamant about to continue my own fun, so I brought us here.

6
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:37,740
I do not remember that.

7
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:41,509
That's because you passed out in the car in the way here.

8
00:00:41,509 --> 00:00:44,509
So you had your way with me while I was passed out?

9
00:00:44,509 --> 00:00:49,549
No, Becca.

10
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:53,549
I too do have standards I live by and sleep in with an unconscious woman,

11
00:00:53,549 --> 00:00:56,549
even when I have been seeing as a no-go for me.

12
00:00:56,549 --> 00:01:27,290
What do you want like me, James?

13
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:29,290
Don't break my heart again, James.

14
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:47,640
I can't handle the heartache.

15
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,019
So, Mother says you have something to tell us?

16
00:01:51,019 --> 00:01:54,019
Yes, it seems your ex-husband is in the apartment here at River Edge.

17
00:01:54,019 --> 00:01:57,019
Now, the two of them were seeing going to the elevator.

18
00:01:57,019 --> 00:01:59,859
We're guessing to this apartment.

19
00:01:59,859 --> 00:02:01,859
So they're not going to stop seeing each other?

20
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:03,859
It seems not, miss.

21
00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:08,219
Is there anything else you need to know?

22
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:09,219
Yes.

23
00:02:09,219 --> 00:02:13,699
I want you to find out everything you can on Becca Woods.

24
00:02:13,699 --> 00:02:18,750
If James won't stop seeing her, then I'll make sure she gets the message.
