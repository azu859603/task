Holy shit. These are expensive.

2
00:00:10.859 --> 00:00:19.519
It's actually decently priced. Oh, Becca, Neil is staying a little longer. He's found

3
00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:28.320
someone he wants to pursue. Yeah. Try that off.

4
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:40.030
Well, perhaps we can find you a nice rich husband there, Talley.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:46.609
I already have a man, mother. Oh, do you? Do you mean that Northern boy? You can't stop

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:51.750
texting? Becca, will you hurry up and show me already?

Uh, yep, I'm ready. You can afford this place. What are you gonna do? Steal it?

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:15.359
I'm going to the gala auction. There is no way that you are going. James is taking you?

9
00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:19.980
You fucking bitch. That's enough. I'm tired of your shit. You can either fuck off back

10
00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.620
to your dress or you'll recluse your fucking mouth. Don't you dare talk to my daughter

11
00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:31.980
like that, you tramp? James, are you in there? Security? Please escort these two women from

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:32.420
