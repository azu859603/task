00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,009
What are you talking about?

2
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:18,510
We aren't married and my seeing her was recent. Have you been telling people I will sleep in with her while we were married?

3
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:29,859
I'm not going through this anymore Alison. Keep her assing Becca. So the hell out of you. Understand.

4
00:00:29,859 --> 00:00:41,600
Oh sweetie. I don't know what I'm doing. That's so wrong.

5
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:47,170
I mean they've been divorced for years. I don't understand it. You did nothing wrong Becca.

6
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:50,520
Honestly, I was surprised by how James acted at the event.

7
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:54,840
He's a strong-willed man and usually puts his foot down with things. I'm leaving.

8
00:00:55,630 --> 00:01:00,270
Allegra, I can't play these games with James anymore. I care about him. Yes, but I

9
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:06,670
Don't have time for this drama. This isn't what I signed up for when I came to Miami. Take some time to think about it. Okay?

10
00:01:06,909 --> 00:01:10,510
It's never good to overreact to anything. I'm done thinking about James.

11
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:15,670
Alison's the woman he wants. He showed me that tonight. But Becca. Why Allegra?

12
00:01:16,069 --> 00:01:22,099
Is he here right now comforting me? No, he's not. You are and I am grateful for that

13
00:01:22,099 --> 00:01:37,680
But I this is just too much for me. I should have enough money for it like to get home. Don't be silly. You don't need to buy a ticket.

14
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,659
It's time to go ladies.
