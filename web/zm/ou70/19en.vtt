1
00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:27.859
Telly hates me, and I think I finally hit bottom.

2
00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:35.219
15 minutes, Alison.

3
00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.469
She won't talk to me, let alone look at me.

4
00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:42.350
She moves around the beach house like I ruined her life.

5
00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:52.500
She said she hates me.

6
00:00:52.500 --> 00:01:12.620
I need help, James.

7
00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.680
Please, I want to go back to me up.

8
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.780
I want to get back up the path that I was on a couple years ago.

9
00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.060
Great.

10
00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.879
I know.

11
00:01:28.879 --> 00:01:32.000
Do you think that we can fix things between us?

12
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.439
No, there is no fixing us.

13
00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:34.799
I told you that when we got divorced.

14
00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.930
James, please!

15
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.450
Wait, wait.

16
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.849
Just, just let me get the help that I need.

17
00:01:42.849 --> 00:01:44.450
And then we can fix things.

18
00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.349
No, Alison, I'm sorry.

19
00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:50.909
But there is no way I would give us a chance again.

20
00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.120
You didn't just cheat on me.

21
00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.560
Your betrayal broke me.

22
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.769
Because you, at one point,

23
00:01:56.769 --> 00:02:04.159
were the only woman I could ever imagine loving.

24
00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:12.139
James, James, why can't you see that I tried to change?

25
00:02:12.139 --> 00:02:15.139
You said that we were changing many times.

26
00:02:15.139 --> 00:02:22.129
And after a while, one stops believing that shit could end up being true.

27
00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:23.889
I hope you do change.

28
00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:32.289
And one day, realize how much you've destroyed acting the way you do.

29
00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:34.460
Alison!

30
00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:35.500
James?
