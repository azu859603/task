00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:09.339
Holy shit, what the fuck happened to you?

2
00:00:09.339 --> 00:00:10.339
What's the commotion?

3
00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:11.339
What happened?

4
00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:13.140
It doesn't matter.

5
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:14.140
What's done is done.

6
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.140
Um, are you still going tonight?

7
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.920
Yeah.

8
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.920
I'm going to leave with Neil tonight and go to New York.

9
00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:42.909
I can't be here anymore like I got to get out of here.

10
00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:44.909
Becca, where's Becca?

11
00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:45.909
What are you doing here?

12
00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:46.909
Becca, where are you?

13
00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:48.909
Becca, where is she?

14
00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:49.909
I need to find her.

15
00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:50.909
It's too late.

16
00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:54.479
Nothing is ever too late.

17
00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:55.479
I have to find her.

18
00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:56.479
That's not what I meant.

19
00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:59.479
I mean, it's too late because she's on her way to catch a flight to New York.

20
00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:01.479
You're not going to make it there in time.

21
00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:06.930
Who?

22
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.469
Neil.

23
00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:20.579
Becca!
