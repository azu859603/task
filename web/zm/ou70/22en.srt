00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:09,169
Hello and welcome to tonight's show.

2
00:00:09,169 --> 00:00:11,990
What?

3
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:16,070
This place is not a tornado to the college party you had when I was gone.

4
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:20,109
You were gone for like a week, knowing all of the college parties.

5
00:00:20,109 --> 00:00:22,829
I appreciate you letting me stay here though.

6
00:00:22,829 --> 00:00:24,789
I love having you here Becca.

7
00:00:24,789 --> 00:00:29,589
You know, I'll turn you over for my business to feel horrible.

8
00:00:29,589 --> 00:00:32,310
Most bachelors at least are pet parents.

9
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:35,630
Yeah, to be honest, I don't really take you as a pet parent.

10
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:39,450
Oh, you and a lego have no faith in me, huh?

11
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,729
Now, have you eaten?

12
00:00:41,729 --> 00:00:44,170
Mm, I'm actually making dinner.

13
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:51,159
So, do you think I can help you with?

14
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:59,200
No, I just need you to go to your room and relax and I'll call you when dinner's ready.

15
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,270
You want to have a kind Becca, do you know that?

16
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:06,950
You've had a long trip now, it's the least I can do.

17
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:08,909
I love having you here Becca.
