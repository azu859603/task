00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
Pekka?

2
00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.189
Mr Valentino, we meet again.

3
00:00:03.189 --> 00:00:05.540
Yeah, Joel.

4
00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.339
Like Russ brother.

5
00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:09.339
How's my sister?

6
00:00:09.339 --> 00:00:11.699
Where's Pekka?

7
00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:14.699
Well, she's probably admiring the painting from the auction.

8
00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:16.920
Listen, man.

9
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.920
I'm not the type of guy who likes to win without playing fair, so...

10
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.920
Before I take her into my bed, why don't you come to New York?

11
00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.920
I'm taking her to a party on Friday.

12
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.359
What are we supposed to do, Nioh?

13
00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:31.870
Tool over her?

14
00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:34.869
I see how you lost your name, Mr Valentino.

15
00:00:34.869 --> 00:00:35.939
You lost her.

16
00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:38.939
I sent you the time and place of the party.

17
00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:39.939
Alright?

18
00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:40.939
I'll see you there, pal.

19
00:00:40.939 --> 00:01:03.649
It's too late for you to go back to work, right?

20
00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:05.379
Work?

21
00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.379
I thought I heard you talking to someone.

22
00:01:07.379 --> 00:01:10.379
Oh, no, I was just complaining about her back.

23
00:01:10.379 --> 00:01:11.379
I always gets to go.
