1
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,259
All right, take it then you let go and you'll play.

2
00:00:06,259 --> 00:00:10,539
Yes, it's beautiful and walking distance to campus.

3
00:00:10,539 --> 00:00:19,260
I must go back to home.

4
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,059
Stay a day longer.

5
00:00:22,059 --> 00:00:27,480
I'll be back soon.

6
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,480
Promise.

7
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:53,840
Becca, it's Allegra.

8
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,939
How are you doing?

9
00:00:55,939 --> 00:00:57,969
It's going okay, I guess.

10
00:00:57,969 --> 00:01:00,969
James just left and he's heading back south.

11
00:01:00,969 --> 00:01:03,969
I bet he is after this shit this morning.

12
00:01:03,969 --> 00:01:07,090
Wait, what do you mean?

13
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:09,250
Something happened?

14
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,250
Oh, damn babe, did he not tell you?

15
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,250
You need to check your phone.

16
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:15,250
You have made national news, sweetie.
