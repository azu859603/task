1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:11,339
We're going to have a very serious conversation telling because you seem to think that you're

2
00:00:11,339 --> 00:00:15,300
able to dictate to me what it is that I do and that's not going to fly.

3
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:21,379
You're screwing my best friend and then on top of all that you made me look like a complete

4
00:00:21,379 --> 00:00:23,300
fool by your actions.

5
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,300
Fool.

6
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,980
You made yourself look like a fool and how day you stand there and make such a big fuss

7
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:31,300
about me being with Becca went for over a year.

8
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:35,100
You went behind her back sleeping with her boyfriend and now you're knocked out by him.

9
00:00:35,299 --> 00:00:37,960
How dare you say something like that about him.

10
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,899
He's going to be your future son-in-law.

11
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:43,600
You know, I'm your daughter.

12
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,880
Why don't you care about me feelings and my tears?

13
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,920
You have no idea how to take care of yourself.

14
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,320
You don't clean up after yourself.

15
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,320
You don't cook.

16
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,039
You don't even wash your own laundry.

17
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:00,399
So how in the hell are you going to take care of yourself, let alone someone else?

18
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:05,840
You think that you are so much better than everyone at everything, but you know Chad?

19
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:11,359
He's actually a really nice guy and comes from a very nice family and I just, you know,

20
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:16,159
I really don't understand what makes you hate him so much when you're willing to screw

21
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,280
someone like Becca.

22
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:23,299
If you marry that boy, your trust fund money is gone.

23
00:01:23,299 --> 00:01:24,859
Remember?

24
00:01:24,859 --> 00:01:28,540
The day you turned 18 I told you I will pay you a monthly allowance while you went to school

25
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:33,219
and after you graduated while you got set up in your career until you could support yourself,

26
00:01:33,219 --> 00:01:35,700
I will stop doing that.

27
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,019
Fine.

28
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:40,030
Then I'm going to move in with Mother.

29
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:43,510
You are not my father, that bitch.

30
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:44,510
She changed you.

31
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:49,269
And I'm going to make her paper everything that she's done to me and this family.

32
00:01:49,269 --> 00:01:53,200
Do what you must do.

33
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,920
Of course I will set something up for my grandkids so that way they have money when they turn

34
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,069
18.

35
00:02:00,069 --> 00:02:03,670
But I'm not giving you another penny if you marry that boy.

36
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:38,129
Where do you want me to start?

37
00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:45,090
I could explain how all my teachers were giving me nasty looks or how the Dean seems

38
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:46,770
to always have a snarky comment.

39
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:50,930
We're better yet how the entire school knows that I'm sleeping with you and everyone finds

40
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:53,930
me horrible for sleeping with my best friend's dad.

41
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:57,830
Oh, it was that kind of day, huh?

42
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:05,400
When are you coming home, James?

43
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,080
I hope to be the weather weekend sweetie.

44
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,219
I'm almost done with things here and then I should be able to come up for a few days.

45
00:03:12,219 --> 00:03:18,979
I know.

46
00:03:18,979 --> 00:03:23,550
My business isn't the concern of your boss anymore.

47
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:26,129
See, that's where you're wrong.

48
00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:29,199
You don't get to decide when business is over.

49
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:30,800
Sergei respects you.

50
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:34,030
He doesn't want things to end badly with you.

51
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:40,270
So he's sent to me to talk some sense into you, considering how close we used to be.

52
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:43,729
Close.

53
00:03:43,729 --> 00:03:51,819
I would consider what we used to do as being close.

54
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:56,580
Sergei and Allison, they may have gotten lunch together the other.

55
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:00,930
He felt bad for the woman that was cast aside for being too old.

56
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:05,360
Cast aside for being too old.

57
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,719
Allison cheated on me, which is why I divorced her.

58
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:12,400
But I find it interesting that Sergei took the time to speak with her.

59
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,780
What did he think he would get from it?

60
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:19,199
This won't end well for you, James.

61
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,879
A man like Sergei isn't forgiving.

62
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:25,379
The very fact that he's even giving you a chance to reconsider should shine in your eyes like

63
00:04:25,379 --> 00:04:32,290
the illuminating factor that it is.

64
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:33,610
I was trying to help.

65
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:35,250
I didn't think that you knew.

66
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,250
What?

67
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,769
That you went behind my back and met with Sergei?

68
00:04:38,769 --> 00:04:41,970
Crying wolf to a man I'm trying to get my family away from?

69
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:44,889
All because I'm sleeping with a woman that isn't you?

70
00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:47,569
Have you lost your fucking mind, Allison?

71
00:04:47,569 --> 00:04:50,019
You, James!

72
00:04:50,019 --> 00:04:52,240
I did everything right.

73
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,959
You are the reason that everything went bad.

74
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:04,180
All I have wanted is for you to pay attention to me, for you to love me and want to make

75
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,180
things work.

76
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:08,879
But all you cared about was your business.

77
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:11,399
You didn't care about the family that you were losing.

78
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:12,399
So it's my fault.

79
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:13,399
My fault.

80
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:16,639
The only thing that was my fault was ever being with you.

81
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,600
I should have listened to everyone back then.

82
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,800
I sort of left your ass in the front steps of that house and walked away, never looking

83
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,800
back.

84
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,800
You ruined everything.

85
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,759
Don't you stay in there and you put this all on me.

86
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:33,980
I had no idea that your business is with him or over.

87
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:39,259
But, James, if you don't continue, he's going to kill you and I don't want to put

88
00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:41,259
our daughter in that position.

89
00:05:41,259 --> 00:05:45,310
Do you really want to risk her life?

90
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:47,230
Stay away from me, Talia and Becca.

91
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:49,449
You need to grow up, Allison.

92
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:50,550
But you know what?

93
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:55,620
You'll be happy to know that I have no idea where Talia is so I can't exactly stay around

94
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,620
her.

95
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:57,939
What?

96
00:05:57,939 --> 00:05:58,939
You don't know where she is.

97
00:05:58,939 --> 00:06:03,379
You're all fucking your little bitch up north.

98
00:06:03,379 --> 00:06:04,379
She ran off.

99
00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:09,439
And I have no idea where she is or who she's when.

100
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:15,310
The beach house is dirty but it's empty and I even went to your place.

101
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:18,029
My housekeeper has no idea where she is.

102
00:06:18,029 --> 00:06:20,230
When was the last time you saw her?

103
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:25,199
Last week, after you guys got on to a fight.

104
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,480
I'll find her.

105
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:53,439
If I now stay the fuck away from all of us, you're not wanted.

106
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,439
James, a man just?

107
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:56,040
Hey, what's going on?

108
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,040
I'm in the middle of something.

109
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,230
Oh, I'm sorry.

110
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:00,670
I didn't mean to bother you.

111
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:04,040
I was checking in on you.

112
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:08,459
I haven't really heard from you today and you're supposed to be here tomorrow so I just

113
00:07:08,459 --> 00:07:13,579
wanted to figure out what time so I could plan something.

114
00:07:13,579 --> 00:07:15,540
I'm not going to be able to make it tomorrow.

115
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:19,519
There are a lot of things going on and they are just very complicated at the moment and

116
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:24,540
as much as I would love to be there with you, I honestly can't.

117
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,079
It's okay.

118
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,079
I completely understand.

119
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:31,399
I'll just figure something else out to do.

120
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:34,420
Do you know when you might be up here?

121
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:38,860
No, I don't know what I'm going to make it up there but I do really have to go.

122
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:41,699
So can we pick up this conversation tomorrow morning?

123
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:42,860
I have some free time.

124
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:43,860
I can schedule you in.

125
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:55,680
You guys tell me, are you ready to do it?

126
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,279
Come in.

127
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:02,360
Well, besides the fact that the entire campus knows that I'm screwing James and they also

128
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,699
think I'm sleeping with you too.

129
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:07,019
Ah, let's think.

130
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:10,939
Well, James is supposed to say me this weekend but he can't.

131
00:08:10,939 --> 00:08:14,800
Yeah, I guess that's all that's really going on.

132
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,240
Oh, I did forget.

133
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:23,439
I now have to schedule in order to have conversations with James because he's too busy to deal with

134
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:24,439
me.

135
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:26,720
You know what?

136
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:35,450
I know that being there, I'll make a call.

137
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:36,570
Can you believe it?

138
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:40,690
I absolutely cannot believe that he got that little bitch pregnant and then brought her home

139
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:45,519
to me like I was supposed to do something about it.

140
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,889
Look who it is.

141
00:08:47,889 --> 00:08:52,480
The little slut who thought she could get into my family.

142
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,879
You heard what I said.

143
00:08:55,879 --> 00:08:58,879
I heard through the grapevine that you weren't coming back to Yale this year.

144
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:01,240
So what are you doing here?

145
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:05,590
I don't know who you heard that from but that definitely is not right.

146
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:09,590
It's my final year and I plan on finishing with honors just as I started.

147
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:13,470
You know, I've got to make sure I get those grades and then I'll take myself on to bigger

148
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,659
and better things.

149
00:09:15,659 --> 00:09:18,940
I wish I could say the same for your son.

150
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:21,940
I wish you had had that kind of fire in you before.

151
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:26,059
Maybe I would have actually considered you a match for him.

152
00:09:26,059 --> 00:09:28,559
As much as I would have liked that before, Barbara.

153
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:30,440
That will never happen now.

154
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:34,840
I'd rather be single than with an arrogant prick who likes to beat on your mind.

155
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,840
But what can I say?

156
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,840
Like father like son.

157
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:48,669
Film tonight.

158
00:09:48,669 --> 00:09:49,669
Yay.

159
00:09:49,669 --> 00:09:51,629
I can't wait.

160
00:09:51,629 --> 00:09:57,789
I spoke to Barbara today and I used the term talked loosely.

161
00:09:57,789 --> 00:10:04,440
But I think Tali might be living with her or at least staying at his apartment here.

162
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:26,419
Let me get Frank on that immediately.

163
00:10:26,419 --> 00:10:48,590
And we need to call the hospital.

164
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:50,879
You need an ambulance.

165
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:51,879
No.

166
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:55,799
I can't go to the hospital.

167
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:56,799
I'll be okay though.

168
00:10:56,799 --> 00:11:00,360
This isn't the first time it's happened to me.

169
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,870
He never hurts the baby though.

170
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:08,759
I just need my face.

171
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:11,259
How did you find me?

172
00:11:11,259 --> 00:11:12,740
Oh.

173
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:15,299
It's not hard considering the rumors trickling around.

174
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:18,769
You have a keycard to get in here.

175
00:11:18,769 --> 00:11:28,919
How late are you downstairs with me?

176
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:29,919
Just getting on the plane now.

177
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,799
I'll be there in a few hours.

178
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:34,200
I need to find Tali.

179
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,200
That's actually why I'm calling.

180
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,820
What do you mean?

181
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:40,580
Have you seen her?

182
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:44,419
You could say that.

183
00:11:44,419 --> 00:11:45,549
James.

184
00:11:45,549 --> 00:11:46,549
Becca.

185
00:11:46,549 --> 00:11:47,549
Where is she?

186
00:11:47,549 --> 00:11:48,549
Okay.

187
00:11:48,549 --> 00:11:49,750
There's no need for the attitude.

188
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,440
Well, don't act the way you are.

189
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,919
You said that you had seen her now.

190
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:54,919
How am I acting?

191
00:11:54,919 --> 00:12:00,600
She's on the couch in our living room.

192
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:47,500
You made the wrong choice.

193
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,299
Daddy, you're only going to make it worse, Daddy.

194
00:12:50,299 --> 00:12:52,360
Please stop it, Becca.

195
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:57,360
He's only going to make it worse.

196
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,360
Becca, say out of this.

197
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,360
What the fuck is going on?

198
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,559
It's none of your business.

199
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:02,080
I am your girlfriend, James.

200
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:05,279
We're supposed to be a team and you involved me in all of this.

201
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,240
So yes, it does have to do with me.

202
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,279
Your daughter's in my apartment wearing my clothes.

203
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:16,720
And after everything she has done to me, I gave her a safe space to be, yet this doesn't

204
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,720
concern me.

205
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,720
Sha, did that to her.

206
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:28,600
So you plan to go and beat him up.

207
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,000
Acting irrational about this, that's how you want to handle it.

208
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,940
I'm not a good person, Becca.

209
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:36,340
I'm dangerous and I do dangerous things.

210
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:39,830
You would do well to remember this.

211
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:43,389
My life isn't legal and neither are my actions.

212
00:13:43,389 --> 00:14:20,419
Your daughter needs you.

213
00:14:20,419 --> 00:14:27,759
You need to start from the beginning and tell me everything that happened.

214
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:34,360
So after I left Miami, I went with Chad to stay with his parents for a few weeks, and

215
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:40,320
his mom really didn't want us to be together, and then his family tried to force me to get

216
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,919
an abortion, even though I didn't want to.

217
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:48,710
And then they realized after I went to the doctor how far along I was, and that's what

218
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:51,659
I got really bad.

219
00:14:51,659 --> 00:14:55,799
How far along are you?

220
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:56,799
Six months.

221
00:14:56,799 --> 00:15:16,720
Do you understand the complications of what you've done with all the partying and drinking?

222
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:24,009
The damage you could have done to that child?

223
00:15:24,009 --> 00:15:25,570
We need to get you to a doctor.

224
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:26,570
No.

225
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:28,009
No, I can't go to a doctor.

226
00:15:28,009 --> 00:15:48,200
I don't want him getting arrested.

227
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,159
I need to apologize to you.

228
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:56,080
I shouldn't have spoken to you like that earlier.

229
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,809
I was just so angry by everything that happened.

230
00:15:59,809 --> 00:16:03,169
But Chad had done to her.

231
00:16:03,169 --> 00:16:07,049
I lost control of myself and lashed out at the one person I shouldn't have.

232
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:12,159
I don't know what you expect me to say.

233
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:17,240
Everything has been so chaotic since the moment I met you this summer.

234
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:22,610
And even though we're together and we have these amazing moments, it's become nothing

235
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:23,610
but toxic.

236
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:24,610
No.

237
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:29,820
We can make this work.

238
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:51,509
We'll figure it out as we have been.

239
00:16:51,509 --> 00:16:54,909
Right tomorrow morning, you and Tal, you're going to be back in Miami.

240
00:16:54,909 --> 00:17:02,940
I've done a lot about things in my life, Becca.

241
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:13,839
One of them was making shady deals to build my empire, illegal things, that caused people

242
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,819
to get hurt.

243
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:17,819
Okay.

244
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:26,309
I mean, I knew you did things that was obvious, but why not explain that to me to help me understand?

245
00:17:26,309 --> 00:17:32,940
I made deals with a Russian leader named Sperda who heard some years ago when I was just

246
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:36,259
a young man trying to build my empire.

247
00:17:36,259 --> 00:17:44,740
My business with him led me to do very shady deals, mix with the wrong people, and make

248
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:45,740
a lot of enemies.

249
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:53,279
Now that I'm older, I try to pull away from the business dealings I did before, but now

250
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:56,039
I've created an enemy of Sir Dave.

251
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:59,319
Wait, do you mean like the mafia?

252
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:03,289
Yes.

253
00:18:03,289 --> 00:18:11,869
I mean the mafia, because I'm refusing to re-sign a deal, say I'm making threats that

254
00:18:11,869 --> 00:18:18,119
they could potentially risk the safety of the people around me.

255
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:20,960
I wouldn't allow them to get anywhere near you.

256
00:18:20,960 --> 00:19:08,700
I can spend some time together, not fun.

257
00:19:08,700 --> 00:20:29,160
James, please, just go take care of yourself, maybe we can talk in the future.

258
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,119
This better be good for you to call me right now.

259
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:35,390
It's nice to talk to you as well.

260
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:38,990
I just wanted to call to see if you've heard anything about Becca.

261
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:44,400
Come on James, that's not what you want to know now, is it?

262
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,339
I haven't spoken to her in a bit.

263
00:20:47,339 --> 00:20:50,579
We've traded some texts, however.

264
00:20:50,579 --> 00:20:52,660
I hear studying can be torturous.

265
00:20:52,660 --> 00:21:00,880
I've been friends for some time.

266
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,079
I get what you're putting down, James.

267
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:53,880
You're a wonderful cook, Becca.

268
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,880
Thank you.

269
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,890
Maybe next time I can cook something you like.

270
00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:03,029
I'll eat your wonderful cooking after I age out of modeling.

271
00:22:03,029 --> 00:22:04,990
I imagine James has been busy.

272
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:08,630
He's been caring for Tali, which is a full-time job.

273
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:12,730
Now that he's out of the way, I can fairly compete for you.

274
00:22:30,369 --> 00:22:35,619
You need to see a doctor.

275
00:22:35,619 --> 00:22:38,819
Now we've been after Sergey for 10 years now,

276
00:22:38,819 --> 00:22:42,690
but no matter what we do, we can't seem to get close enough to him.

277
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:45,250
However, he's made a point multiple times

278
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:50,720
to get a hold of you, so we want to strike a deal,

279
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,319
because we could put you away for 15, 20 years with everything

280
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:56,000
we have on you.

281
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:06,119
Oh, that is unless Sergey kills you first.

282
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:09,559
I'd under one condition.

283
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:12,710
I want to make sure that my family,

284
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:18,039
my daughter, all of them are protected and kept safe.

285
00:23:18,039 --> 00:23:23,339
That pretty girl up in New York?

286
00:23:23,339 --> 00:23:24,900
I want her protected, too.

287
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:38,339
We get a call soon.

288
00:23:38,339 --> 00:23:41,359
Sure.

289
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:43,319
Have a good night, Mr. Valentino.

290
00:23:43,319 --> 00:24:13,099
Tali needs me.

291
00:24:13,099 --> 00:24:15,579
Tali doesn't need a mother in your condition.

292
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:17,779
Her daughter needs her mother.

293
00:24:17,779 --> 00:24:19,059
Leave, Allison.

294
00:24:19,059 --> 00:24:20,059
No, James, you can't.

295
00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:21,259
I'm praying.

296
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:57,440
Allison, it's OK.

297
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,200
Becca, just in case you don't read my texts,

298
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,640
Tali needs you.

299
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,950
She's gone into a premature labor.

300
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:06,630
You don't have to go, Becca.

301
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,069
Don't influence her, Neil.

302
00:25:08,069 --> 00:25:09,269
It's her choice.

303
00:25:09,269 --> 00:25:14,170
It's too early for Tali to give birth.

304
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:16,009
She must be freaking out.

305
00:25:16,009 --> 00:25:19,730
She has parents that type of situation is for family only.

306
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:23,089
We can see why you're still single, Neil.

307
00:25:23,089 --> 00:25:25,339
You have a good life here.

308
00:25:25,339 --> 00:25:31,269
New York's been good to you.

309
00:25:31,269 --> 00:25:34,750
Tali needs me.

310
00:25:34,750 --> 00:26:04,930
After I help her, I'm going to tell James that I'm pregnant.

311
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:07,130
How long have you been standing there?

312
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:09,109
More enough.

313
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:15,269
I can tell you've gotten the hang of it.

314
00:26:15,269 --> 00:26:18,430
Did I hear the phone earlier?

315
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:25,109
Becca, I know how much you've been missing her.

316
00:26:25,109 --> 00:26:30,900
I'm unhappy you are.

317
00:26:30,900 --> 00:27:25,769
I'm sure she's moved on, Tali.

318
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:27,509
Well, hello there, Rebecca.

319
00:27:27,509 --> 00:27:30,309
It's funny seeing you in these parks.

320
00:27:30,309 --> 00:27:33,190
What the fuck are you doing here?

321
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:35,990
You better watch yourself, Rebecca.

322
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:38,829
You're sadly mistaken if you think you can get James,

323
00:27:38,829 --> 00:27:40,680
or that he walks you.

324
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:43,640
He's already been with me twice since you've been out of the picture.

325
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:47,660
And he was more than satisfied both times.

326
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:51,640
Go to hell.

327
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,589
You know Rebecca.

328
00:27:53,589 --> 00:27:56,549
Well, I think it's happened to people who don't know how to mind their business.

329
00:27:56,549 --> 00:28:00,180
You better watch her back.

330
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:02,099
Enjoy New York train.

331
00:28:02,099 --> 00:28:21,630
I hope this is the last time we'll see each other.

332
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:23,619
What are you doing in my office?

333
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:25,819
Oh, James.

334
00:28:25,819 --> 00:28:28,460
Is that any way to greet no lover?

335
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:30,259
I know you missed me.

336
00:28:30,259 --> 00:28:33,980
I thought I'd clarify that I didn't want to see you in my office again.

337
00:28:34,059 --> 00:28:39,359
Oh, well, it isn't like you have a chance here, is it?

338
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:41,400
Daddy wanted to come kill you.

339
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:45,140
But I persuaded him to let me see you instead.

340
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:48,140
Why would your father want to kill me over not giving him a contract?

341
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:50,049
Oh, that isn't why.

342
00:28:50,049 --> 00:28:53,569
He thinks you're doing deals with the Feds.

343
00:28:53,569 --> 00:28:55,329
I told him you must be mistaken.

344
00:28:55,329 --> 00:28:58,039
We all know what kind of man you really are.

345
00:28:58,039 --> 00:29:02,799
So, he sent me here to talk sex in here.

346
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:05,900
The Feds?

347
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:08,940
Why the fuck would he think that?

348
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:11,329
Get back with me, James.

349
00:29:11,329 --> 00:29:13,970
Father will forgive you if you do.

350
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:20,170
Thanks.

351
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:26,579
Good note, thanks.

352
00:29:26,579 --> 00:29:48,450
Security.

353
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:49,569
Excuse me.

354
00:29:49,569 --> 00:29:54,349
Thank you.

355
00:29:54,349 --> 00:30:16,150
I can't wait to see Becca dad.

356
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:18,400
Christmas, my dog.

357
00:30:18,400 --> 00:31:05,299
Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.

358
00:31:05,299 --> 00:31:07,569
It's, um...

359
00:31:07,569 --> 00:31:08,930
He uses me.

360
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:12,789
I can't believe it.

361
00:31:12,789 --> 00:31:14,710
I did so many horrible things.

362
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:16,190
No doubt.

363
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:18,549
Do not think about the past.

364
00:31:18,549 --> 00:31:23,390
He is healthy, he's beautiful, he's perfect.

365
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:32,900
Yeah, he is, because he has always been such a good friend to me through everything, even

366
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:35,430
when I didn't deserve a...

367
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:48,559
Tell you the past is the past.

368
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:50,430
Follow me.

369
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:51,630
I want to show you something.

370
00:31:51,630 --> 00:32:02,299
Did you put the nursery in here, James' room?

371
00:32:02,299 --> 00:32:03,299
Something like that.

372
00:32:03,299 --> 00:32:08,619
Don't you think my dad would be the best person to watch after him in the middle of the night?

373
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:10,779
Alright.

374
00:32:10,779 --> 00:32:12,779
Are you really Becca?

375
00:32:12,779 --> 00:32:15,069
I'm not sure.

376
00:32:15,069 --> 00:32:40,269
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

377
00:32:40,269 --> 00:32:45,559
Disturfing me.

378
00:32:45,559 --> 00:32:47,119
I'm so happy you're back.

379
00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:51,460
There's something I want to talk to you about.

380
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:53,910
I thought it would be later.

381
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:57,660
It now seems better than later.

382
00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:04,799
You're pregnant?

383
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:14,730
I think you know how someone gets pregnant, James.

384
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:20,849
May I?

385
00:33:20,849 --> 00:33:28,759
I didn't walk us.

386
00:33:28,759 --> 00:33:40,559
There's so much to talk, James.

387
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:49,009
You've known about this pregnancy longer than I have.

388
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:53,799
May I have some time to enjoy the moment, please?

389
00:33:53,799 --> 00:34:11,829
Yeah.

390
00:34:11,829 --> 00:34:12,829
I'm Mr. Valentino.

391
00:34:12,829 --> 00:34:13,829
This just came for you.

392
00:34:13,829 --> 00:34:36,750
It wouldn't hurt her.

393
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:38,389
My grandchild.

394
00:34:38,389 --> 00:34:39,480
Shh!

395
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,480
No!

396
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,480
You brought it!

397
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,639
No, I was seeing it.

398
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,639
You all need for all the emotions.

399
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,030
You all this?

400
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:49,650
You all the consequences of dealing with the devil.

401
00:34:49,650 --> 00:35:16,400
Did I miss something?

402
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,489
Yeah.

403
00:35:18,489 --> 00:35:21,099
Our entire dinner.

404
00:35:21,099 --> 00:35:23,820
Keep thinking you're going to shoot anyone that walks past the table.

405
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:28,360
I hope you understand that you're pregnant and I've put you in a very dangerous issue.

406
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,280
I understand, James.

407
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:33,119
But can we please enjoy our dinner?

408
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:38,980
At this rate, I think I'm going to get sour lemons for dessert.

409
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:41,480
I must protect you.

410
00:35:41,480 --> 00:36:01,570
I have never felt more protected.

411
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:04,289
Give us some more time, Mr. Valentino.

412
00:36:04,289 --> 00:36:05,289
Everything's going to work out.

413
00:36:05,289 --> 00:36:08,159
No, I have no more time.

414
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:11,679
We've done everything we promised, Mr. Valentino, and everything should be over at a few weeks

415
00:36:11,679 --> 00:36:12,679
at best.

416
00:36:12,679 --> 00:36:16,079
I have a pregnant girlfriend.

417
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:18,079
Do something to capture a surrogate.

418
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:35,389
Becca, I'm not angry that you're pregnant with my future brother or sister.

419
00:36:35,389 --> 00:36:38,030
You're going to make an amazing mother.

420
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:40,510
You're already an amazing person already.

421
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:41,510
So you don't hate me?

422
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:44,349
Because I don't hate you.

423
00:36:44,349 --> 00:36:49,039
I hate what got us to this point, you know?

424
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:54,659
Ever since having a baby, I'm a changed woman.

425
00:36:54,659 --> 00:37:00,559
And so what that brings me to my next point is, if anything would ever happen to me, you

426
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:04,519
want you to take full custody over my son.

427
00:37:04,519 --> 00:37:10,320
My dad would be a wreck, and my mother is obviously out of the question, so I hope that's

428
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:14,360
okay.

429
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:22,559
Tell me, if anything ever happens to you, I promise you, I will take care of your son.

430
00:37:22,559 --> 00:37:24,559
But enough of the heavy stuff, okay?

431
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:27,610
Tell me what else is going on.

432
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:34,309
Well, okay, mom, mom journeys, you know?

433
00:37:34,309 --> 00:37:36,150
Nancy, take my son to the panic room.

434
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:37,150
Okay, we have to get up.

435
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:38,150
I can help you.

436
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:39,630
Come on.

437
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:48,880
Let's go.

438
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,159
You finally return my call.

439
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:51,519
Mr. Valentino.

440
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:53,079
It's my ass on the line, Greg.

441
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:54,800
It's my ass.

442
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,179
I need your help.

443
00:37:57,179 --> 00:38:00,219
Mr. Valentino, FBI's operation is my...

444
00:38:00,219 --> 00:38:01,619
Do it, Greg.

445
00:38:01,619 --> 00:38:28,429
Tonight, no excuses.

446
00:38:28,429 --> 00:38:34,269
Mr. Valentino, big timeless car.

447
00:38:34,269 --> 00:38:39,800
Oh, my daughter's love.

448
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:51,539
There's no match for a man's desire for his womb.

449
00:38:51,539 --> 00:38:54,429
We go home.

450
00:38:54,429 --> 00:38:56,150
Greg, this is James Valentino.

451
00:38:56,150 --> 00:39:00,090
Sergey has Talia and Becca tied up at my home.

452
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:11,039
We're leaving.

453
00:39:11,039 --> 00:39:12,300
No, no.

454
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,300
Lower your hands.

455
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,300
I'm not the cops.

456
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:18,150
Worse.

457
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:19,559
No, no.

458
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:23,090
Forget about me.

459
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:26,269
Hmm?

460
00:39:26,269 --> 00:39:27,840
Oh.

461
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:33,670
What's your choice, James?

462
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:34,670
Hmm?

463
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:41,820
This could have been so easy.

464
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:45,300
All you had to do was continue your relationship with Khatsui.

465
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:50,050
The chosen one means what?

466
00:39:50,050 --> 00:40:40,170
Sergey!

467
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:41,170
The target, repeat.

468
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:46,039
I lost sight of targets.

469
00:40:46,039 --> 00:40:48,639
I need a bus to the Valentino house.

470
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:49,639
Victims appear fine.

471
00:40:49,639 --> 00:40:52,920
One of them appears pregnant and he transports to the hospital.

472
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,480
Taking Miss Valentino to the ambulance.

473
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,760
I need Miss Wood soon, all right?
