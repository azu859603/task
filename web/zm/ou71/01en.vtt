00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.050
DARREN, you steal my necklace!

2
00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:11.240
What do you mean?

3
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.240
It's mine, it was left to me by my parents.

4
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.750
You're just a servant of a black wind tribe.

5
00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.750
How could you afford such an expensive necklace?

6
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.750
You must have stolen it.

7
00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.379
Please give it back.

8
00:00:27.379 --> 00:00:30.480
This is the only memory I have left of my parents.

9
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.479
Kristen, you're just an orphan without a wolf.

10
00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:36.479
Still dreaming of finding your parents?

11
00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:41.560
How ridiculous.

12
00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.560
Oops, had Amelia again.

13
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.820
Justin, this wretched Kristen stole my necklace.

14
00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.820
Oh, but Justin, it's not like that.

15
00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.820
This necklace belongs to me.

16
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.820
All right, Amelia, stop bullying her.

17
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:53.820
It's just a necklace.

18
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:54.820
Give it back to her.

19
00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.189
And remember to come to the office to see me later.

20
00:00:59.189 --> 00:01:04.340
As if I'd give it back to you.

21
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:33.790
Your Majesty, what's wrong?

22
00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.549
I just ascended the throne.

23
00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:40.549
And already the elders are impatient for a new queen

24
00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:42.549
to be in the lycan palace.

25
00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:45.549
Your Majesty, you still don't have a partner.

26
00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:47.549
It's normal for the elders to be anxious.

27
00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.549
Why don't you go visit the Magia Alpha tribes and have a look?

28
00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:51.549
Hey.

29
00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:54.549
Maybe Lady Luck will step in and you'll find your partner.

30
00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:57.950
Fine.

31
00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.459
Arrange it.
