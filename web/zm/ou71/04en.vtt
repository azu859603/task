00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.799
Yes, that's right. Your partner is me, and there's a knowing fact I've known for such a long time.

2
00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.400
You knew I was your partner all this time, and you're still flammable!

3
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.800
Know your place, Christine. I've already given you a favor.

4
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:29.000
I'm willing to sleep with you. You're still dreaming to become my Luna. Amelia, she is the daughter of the Elders. From head to toe, she's more noble than you.

5
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Justin, why waste time talking to her? If she dares to defy, you just throw her out of the tribe. Let her become a lone wolf.

6
00:00:38.159 --> 00:00:40.159
What? You don't know how to knock?

7
00:00:40.159 --> 00:00:44.509
King Ellen has come to inspect our tribe. Please go meet with him.

8
00:00:44.509 --> 00:00:49.509
Justin, Justin, you should go. I heard this new lycan king is a ruthless tyrant.

9
00:00:49.509 --> 00:00:54.509
Lock this bitch in the warehouse. After the king leaves, I'm gonna have my way with her.
