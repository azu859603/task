1
00:00:03,379 --> 00:00:11,300
Hmm, so her name is Kristin, and the coming of age ceremony is next month.

2
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:19,879
Your Majesty, Ms. Kristin still doesn't have a partner, why don't you go and grab her, directly?

3
00:00:19,879 --> 00:00:24,339
Cassius, you know very well just how bad my reputation is outside.

4
00:00:24,339 --> 00:00:26,980
If I approach her directly, she'll be scared to death.

5
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:30,899
Those people, they're always spreading rumours about you making you have to be a tyrant

6
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:37,899
and when the actual fact, every order that you've been given, and every order that you're giving, has been to eliminate the assassins.

7
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:41,899
Cassius, I have no experience in pursuing women.

8
00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:52,700
Do I send her flowers? Cassius, I want you to arrange 999 roses and have them send to her on her coming of age ceremony.

9
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:55,500
Yes, your Majesty.

10
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:00,950
And Cassius, don't worry, I haven't forgotten the promise I made.

11
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:03,179
I have people looking for your sister.

12
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:05,719
Thank you, Majesty.

13
00:01:05,719 --> 00:01:24,859
Father, as the Alpha on the Silver Moon tribe, we're falsely accused of rebelling and cruelly killed by traitors.

14
00:01:24,859 --> 00:01:27,140
I will never again this humiliation.

15
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:33,069
One day, I will seek justice for my parents and bring my sister back.

16
00:01:33,069 --> 00:01:37,329
With this necklace, I will find her.
