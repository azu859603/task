1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,529
Cassius, I'm just remembered.

2
00:00:02,529 --> 00:00:04,530
It's Kristin's coming of age ceremony today.

3
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:07,940
Such an on-day, I've got to go and see her.

4
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:11,939
Your Majesty, Elder Roy is already waiting for you in the reception area.

5
00:00:11,939 --> 00:00:15,939
I know, I know, look, you go over to the Blackwind tribe and take care of Kristin, okay?

6
00:00:15,939 --> 00:00:18,940
The last time I saw her, she did not look happy.

7
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:20,640
I've got it.

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,079
In the meantime, I'm gonna go and see Elder Roy.

9
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:27,079
Once I've finished, I'll join you.

10
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:30,100
We've got this.

11
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:46,369
There are holes everywhere.

12
00:00:46,369 --> 00:00:47,460
Oh my God.

13
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,909
This is my only dress.

14
00:00:49,909 --> 00:00:54,070
It looks like I'll have to wear it to the queen of age ceremony.

15
00:00:54,070 --> 00:01:18,239
Oh my God.

16
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:23,239
Everyone come and see, how can someone dare to dress like this for the coming of age ceremony?

17
00:01:23,239 --> 00:01:26,239
Her dress is torn, so pathetic.

18
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:28,239
If I were her, I would rather be crying right now.

19
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:30,819
No, my dress was fine.

20
00:01:30,819 --> 00:01:32,819
But someone just cut it right before the ceremony.

21
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:34,819
Stop pretending, Kristin.

22
00:01:34,819 --> 00:01:36,819
Everyone knows you're an orphan.

23
00:01:36,819 --> 00:01:38,819
Too poor to even afford a dress.

24
00:01:38,819 --> 00:01:40,819
Hurry up and get out of here.

25
00:01:40,819 --> 00:01:42,819
What do you mean this is my ceremony?

26
00:01:42,819 --> 00:01:44,819
A she will flex you attending the ceremony?

27
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:47,819
It's embarrassing for our black wind try.
