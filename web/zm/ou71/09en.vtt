Wow, Amelia. So many beautiful roses. They must be from Justin.

2
00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:07.910
Wow, it's so romantic. I envy you so much.

3
00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.910
Justin, why did you send so many flowers?

4
00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.910
These are 999 flowers. Send to Miss Kristin. Please sign here.

5
00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.910
What? Kristin? You must be mistaken. Who sends flowers to an orphan like her?

6
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.910
Yeah, the roses must be for Amelia. Probably a mistake on the label.

7
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.640
It's true, but it's for me. Yeah, it says my name.

8
00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.640
Kristin, have you gotten mad? They're mine.

9
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:37.619
What is going on here? These flowers are up on Miss Kristin.

10
00:00:37.619 --> 00:00:41.299
Oh my. Isn't that Anfa Cassius?

11
00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:45.299
Oh my God. He's even more handsome in person than on TV.

12
00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:49.299
Just a few worthless flowers. Who cares?

13
00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:52.869
Thank you for standing up for me, Anfa Cassius.

14
00:00:52.869 --> 00:01:00.299
You're welcome, Miss Kristin. You know, you remind me a lot of my long-lost sister.

15
00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:05.590
She'll be about your age now. We've been looking for her for a long time.

16
00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.489
Hope you're fine.

17
00:01:07.489 --> 00:01:16.709
Yeah. It's just as you said, you had to see. They'd bring a new dress.
