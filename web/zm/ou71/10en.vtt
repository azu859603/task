00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:06.309
Justin, someone sent 999 roses for that wench, Kristen.

2
00:00:06.309 --> 00:00:07.309
What?

3
00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:10.810
This wench, I don't know where she's seduced wild men.

4
00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:14.189
Christine, you are really despicable.

5
00:00:14.189 --> 00:00:18.190
Everyone in the black wind tribe knows you're a homeless orphan,

6
00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:20.690
but lonely servant girl.

7
00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:22.190
Who gave you flowers?

8
00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.190
You must have slept with other werewolves behind my back.

9
00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:28.190
Justin, steps not near me. I would never do such a thing.

10
00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.190
Alpha Justin, watch your words.

11
00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:34.189
I personally vouch for the integrity of Kristen,

12
00:00:34.189 --> 00:00:38.579
and the king sent her these flowers himself.

13
00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.579
King Lyca? He sent her those flowers.

14
00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.899
Alpha Cassius stopped joking.

15
00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:46.899
His Majesty King Alan is too noble to be interested in Kristen,

16
00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:50.899
in this low light. She's not even worthy to polish his Majesty's shoes.

17
00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:55.899
Exactly. Her partner is me, and I've refused her for such a long time.

18
00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:59.899
She's a worthless mother wolf. Nobody wants.

19
00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:04.120
Justin, let go of me, and I will reject the deal.

20
00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.120
Justin, you are disrespecting King Lyca.

21
00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:13.540
I won't believe this nonsense, until his Majesty King Alan admitted himself.

22
00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:20.079
His Majesty King Alan has arrived.

23
00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:24.560
Alpha Justin, what are you doing?
