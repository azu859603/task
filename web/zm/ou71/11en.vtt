1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Alpha, just it! What are you doing?

2
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.820
Your Majesty King Alan, we're honored to have you graze our tribe's ceremony.

3
00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.019
It's nothing, just some lowly people who don't know their places.

4
00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:24.920
You Majesty Alan, this woman has been disrespectful to her Alpha all along,

5
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.019
and she even dares to claim that these roses are all from you.

6
00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.920
These roses are indeed from me, because I am pursuing Miss Kristin.

7
00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.929
Miss Kristin, I apologize for being so late,

8
00:00:36.929 --> 00:00:40.189
and I hope that I've not caused you too much distress.

9
00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:43.189
Miss Kristin Alan, oh my god, these roses are actually from King Alan.

10
00:00:43.189 --> 00:00:44.189
I came to Kristin.

11
00:00:44.189 --> 00:00:47.189
Justin has really offended King Lykin.

12
00:00:47.189 --> 00:00:50.189
No, no, this wench, how could you?

13
00:00:50.189 --> 00:00:56.189
Miss, unless you want to make enemies with the King, I suggest you mind your words.

14
00:00:56.189 --> 00:01:02.189
Alpha Justin, I sincerely hope that this is the last time I see you disrespecting Miss Kristin.

15
00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:06.790
Miss Kristin, when I heard that your dress had been torn,

16
00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.920
I prepared you a new dress.

17
00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.920
Please, take it and go and get changed and enjoy this ceremony.

18
00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.920
Kristin accepted quickly.

19
00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.920
He's the new partner bestowed upon us by the moon goddess.

20
00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.239
So what you're so kind?

21
00:01:20.239 --> 00:01:41.739
Wench, she actually embarrassed me in public.

22
00:01:41.739 --> 00:01:53.530
Justin, Justin?

23
00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.530
Kristin, today you're the moon's dazzling queen of the adult family.

24
00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:07.920
Kristin, no, I can't accept it.

25
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:19.020
You could only be mine. I won't let you go.

26
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.020
May I call you Kristin?

27
00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.020
Kristin, I just stand in my king.

28
00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.120
You do not have to keep calling me your majesty.

29
00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.009
When you're with me, I just want you to see me as your partner.

30
00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:34.139
But I'm sure your wolf already told you that.

31
00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:37.139
I know that you haven't had it easy with Black Wind Tribe.

32
00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:39.139
Come and stay with me in my palace.

33
00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:40.139
Be my queen.

34
00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:46.919
I know that you haven't had it easy with Black Wind Tribe.

35
00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:48.919
Come and stay with me in my palace.

36
00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:49.919
Be my queen.

37
00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:52.879
No, I'm not good enough.

38
00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:57.039
I don't think I have what it takes to be a good queen.

39
00:02:57.039 --> 00:03:00.039
Kristin, in the very first moment I saw you,

40
00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:03.080
I knew why I was born into this world.

41
00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.080
It was to meet you.

42
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.360
I don't care what the others say.

43
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.620
To me, you are such a unique treasure.

44
00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:11.780
Come with me.

45
00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:18.099
What are we waiting for?

46
00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:20.159
This is already prepared the car.

47
00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:22.409
Let's go.

48
00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:25.469
There's one more thing I need to do, people.

49
00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:34.879
I'll be right back.

50
00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:46.219
My necklace.

51
00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:47.219
This wench.

52
00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:49.280
Don't be so pleased.

53
00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.280
I will make you pay.

54
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.389
It's all over now.

55
00:03:56.389 --> 00:03:58.389
A fending king lichen.

56
00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:03.569
This bitch will badmouthe behind me.

57
00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:05.569
And he will kick me out of the wolf pack.

58
00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:08.569
Darling, don't worry too much about this bitch.

59
00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:09.569
She doesn't have that much power.

60
00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:10.569
You forget.

61
00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:12.569
King Allen is known as the tyrant.

62
00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:14.569
Those women he picks.

63
00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:15.569
He kills them all.

64
00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:18.569
Kristin won't have a good ending.

65
00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:19.699
You're right.

66
00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:20.699
How can I forget it?

67
00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:24.399
By the way, he just plays with her now.

68
00:04:24.399 --> 00:04:27.399
And when he finds a real queen, he'll quickly abandon her.

69
00:04:27.399 --> 00:04:30.750
So sweet.

70
00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:38.740
Darling, can you accompany me to pick up another day?

71
00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:39.740
An engagement ring?

72
00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.740
I want a pink one.

73
00:04:41.740 --> 00:05:00.439
Whatever you want.

74
00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:05.660
Kristin, I've prepared a few gifts here to welcome you into the palace.

75
00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:09.170
I selected all these myself in the treasury.

76
00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:10.170
Do you like them?

77
00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:29.189
Kristin.

78
00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:33.019
I've prepared a few gifts here to welcome you into the palace.

79
00:05:33.019 --> 00:05:36.019
I selected all these myself in the treasury.

80
00:05:36.019 --> 00:05:42.310
Do you like them?

81
00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:43.310
Too extravagant.

82
00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:45.310
I can't take it.

83
00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.839
These were all meant for you.

84
00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:53.839
Here, I want you to be the most prestigious queen of the entire wolf pack.

85
00:05:53.839 --> 00:05:55.839
Try these crystal shoes.

86
00:05:55.839 --> 00:05:57.839
I had the maiden secret the first day I met you.

87
00:05:57.839 --> 00:06:09.819
Not to use to bring any of you.

88
00:06:09.819 --> 00:06:24.899
I'm so sorry.

89
00:06:24.899 --> 00:06:29.589
This is Lily from now on.

90
00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:33.589
She will be your personal maid and you can ask her for anything you like.

91
00:06:33.589 --> 00:06:36.589
Ladies, please give us a moment.

92
00:06:36.589 --> 00:06:38.589
I'd like to speak with Kristin here.

93
00:06:38.589 --> 00:06:40.879
Everything is horrible.

94
00:06:40.879 --> 00:06:51.459
That was my first kiss just now.

95
00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:24.430
I just remembered I have some official business that I need to do and I should.

96
00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:28.430
Why don't you go to sleep and I'll see you tomorrow.

97
00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:55.639
What?

98
00:07:55.639 --> 00:07:56.759
There's something wrong.

99
00:07:56.759 --> 00:07:58.759
How could that be?

100
00:07:58.759 --> 00:08:01.759
Although I also thought something should have happened.

101
00:08:01.759 --> 00:08:06.699
You've been so brave.

102
00:08:06.699 --> 00:08:11.240
No, he probably thinks that I'm that kind of woman.

103
00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:13.240
Don't do I think I'd Kristin.

104
00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:28.480
Good night.

105
00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:33.100
You know very well what happened.

106
00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:34.100
I'm just so excited.

107
00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:36.100
I think I'm gonna mess the whole thing up.

108
00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:40.210
She doesn't know I'm a virgin.

109
00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:43.440
I'm just worried that I'm gonna perform poorly.

110
00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:46.519
You apologize tomorrow.

111
00:08:46.519 --> 00:09:41.899
She must have misunderstood.

112
00:09:41.899 --> 00:09:42.899
You're a little boy.

113
00:09:42.899 --> 00:10:02.570
I'm afraid I won't perform well.

114
00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:03.570
Make an announcement.

115
00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:09.149
I want the entire nation to know that Kristin is to be my future queen.

116
00:10:09.149 --> 00:10:10.149
Yes, my lord.

117
00:10:10.149 --> 00:10:12.980
Then I'll please don't do this.

118
00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:13.980
I'm not ready yet.

119
00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:16.429
I don't want to be extravagant.

120
00:10:16.429 --> 00:10:17.429
All right, fine.

121
00:10:17.429 --> 00:10:19.460
If you don't want to do it now,

122
00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:22.070
we'll do it before the wedding.

123
00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:23.070
And after dinner,

124
00:10:23.070 --> 00:11:03.409
we're gonna go shopping and get more clothes and jewelry.

125
00:11:03.409 --> 00:11:09.860
Yes, I'm sorry.

126
00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:11.860
I have a meeting I have to attend to.

127
00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:14.019
But for now, here.

128
00:11:14.019 --> 00:11:15.019
Take this.

129
00:11:15.019 --> 00:11:17.019
This card has no spending limits.

130
00:11:17.019 --> 00:11:18.019
Buy whatever you like.

131
00:11:18.019 --> 00:11:21.019
You go shopping first and I'll catch up with you after the meeting's done.

132
00:11:21.019 --> 00:11:24.169
Thank you so much.

133
00:11:24.169 --> 00:11:25.169
Don't worry about me.

134
00:11:25.169 --> 00:11:38.240
I can take care of myself.

135
00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:40.240
Am I saying things right?

136
00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:41.240
Is that Kristin?

137
00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:51.700
Was it possible Kristin and that poor alone wolf couldn't possibly afford to shop at such a high-end mall?

138
00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:52.700
Let's go, darling.

139
00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:55.700
You have to buy me the most beautiful diamond ring.

140
00:11:57.049 --> 00:11:58.049
Okay, let's go.

141
00:11:58.049 --> 00:12:03.090
You should get something for me.

142
00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:12.830
Looks like one of those poor people who can't afford a single branded item.

143
00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:13.830
Excuse me.

144
00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:15.659
The luxury store.

145
00:12:15.659 --> 00:12:18.299
People like you are not loud in here.

146
00:12:18.299 --> 00:12:24.679
It can't be that expensive.

147
00:12:24.679 --> 00:12:26.679
Do you see yourself dressed like that?

148
00:12:26.679 --> 00:12:28.679
Let me tell you something.

149
00:12:28.679 --> 00:12:31.679
The cheapest tie in here cost 15,000.

150
00:12:31.679 --> 00:12:36.039
So, why would you choose you that I don't have that kind of money?

151
00:12:36.039 --> 00:12:39.039
Don't judge a book by its cover.

152
00:12:39.039 --> 00:12:41.769
How much for this ring?

153
00:12:41.769 --> 00:12:44.769
Well, this ring costs more than you can imagine.

154
00:12:44.769 --> 00:12:46.769
It is a limited edition.

155
00:12:46.769 --> 00:12:52.769
If you damage it, even if you sell everything that you own, you won't be able to afford it.

156
00:12:52.769 --> 00:12:55.769
You are so out of line.

157
00:12:55.769 --> 00:13:04.100
I'm going to speak to your manager and tell them that I want to buy this earrings.

158
00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:32.129
Someone, I'm the alpha of the Black Wind Tribe and I want to buy some jewelry for my future Luna.

159
00:13:32.129 --> 00:13:34.129
Am I mistaken?

160
00:13:34.129 --> 00:13:35.129
Christine?

161
00:13:35.129 --> 00:13:38.360
What are you doing in such a luxury shop?

162
00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:40.360
What can you pay with your money?

163
00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:41.360
The air?

164
00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:48.639
Kristen, it's really you.

165
00:13:48.639 --> 00:13:50.639
What are you doing here, bitch?

166
00:13:50.639 --> 00:13:53.149
They're so escaping you to scumbacks.

167
00:13:53.149 --> 00:13:56.110
Haven't been shopping.

168
00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:57.110
What in luck?

169
00:13:57.110 --> 00:14:00.200
How dare you talk to me like that?

170
00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:02.200
You're looking for some trouble?

171
00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:03.649
Oh, darling.

172
00:14:03.649 --> 00:14:04.649
I like this one.

173
00:14:04.649 --> 00:14:05.649
The earrings.

174
00:14:05.649 --> 00:14:06.649
Let's take it.

175
00:14:06.649 --> 00:14:07.940
You like it?

176
00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:08.940
Alright.

177
00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:09.940
How much is that?

178
00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:12.639
What?

179
00:14:12.639 --> 00:14:13.669
What?

180
00:14:13.669 --> 00:14:16.669
I think I'll choose a different design.

181
00:14:16.669 --> 00:14:20.759
This one doesn't quite match to my future Luna.

182
00:14:20.759 --> 00:14:29.450
Oh, can I afford such expensive earrings?

183
00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:30.450
Maybe I should buy it.

184
00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:32.450
I actually saw it first.

185
00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:34.450
I didn't say we couldn't afford it.

186
00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:37.450
I said it isn't suitable for her.

187
00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:39.450
Kristen, stop pretending.

188
00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:42.450
You're just a lowly maid from our tribe.

189
00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:46.450
The stench of poverty radiates from you even from three blocks away.

190
00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:51.610
And now you dare to boast about buying such expensive shit?

191
00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:54.610
Forget about $1,500,000.

192
00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:58.379
I doubt she could even put up $50,000.

193
00:14:58.379 --> 00:15:04.690
Othering my customers and hindering my business, please leave immediately.

194
00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:14.720
How about this?

195
00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:15.720
How is that possible?

196
00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:17.720
Justin, don't be fooled.

197
00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:18.720
It just must be fake.

198
00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:25.750
Give me the card reader.

199
00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:27.750
I knew it.

200
00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:28.750
It's fake.

201
00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:32.750
Christine, you have the nerve to pretend to be a black card member.

202
00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:35.960
Someone arrest this bitch.

203
00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:48.639
Oh, Kristen, stop lying, you bitch.

204
00:15:48.639 --> 00:15:50.639
You're just a shameless gold digger.

205
00:15:50.639 --> 00:15:54.399
You dare to deceive people with counterfeits?

206
00:15:54.399 --> 00:15:56.620
I really thought she could come up with all that money.

207
00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:58.840
Turns out it was all of an act.

208
00:15:58.840 --> 00:15:59.840
How shameful.

209
00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:04.289
I almost fell for your acting skills.

210
00:16:04.289 --> 00:16:05.289
Too bad.

211
00:16:05.289 --> 00:16:08.289
But show have to end up here.

212
00:16:08.289 --> 00:16:09.580
No!

213
00:16:10.899 --> 00:16:14.049
Look, you don't trust me.

214
00:16:14.049 --> 00:16:15.049
Let me prove it.

215
00:16:15.049 --> 00:16:19.179
This is the receipt that I got in other stores when I was buying things, right?

216
00:16:19.179 --> 00:16:21.179
So look at the amount of the date.

217
00:16:21.179 --> 00:16:26.340
And tell me, if this card is fake, how was I able to use it?

218
00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:29.519
I don't believe this.

219
00:16:29.519 --> 00:16:32.419
So if the card is not a problem.

220
00:16:32.419 --> 00:16:41.559
Our reputation is this in store.

221
00:16:41.559 --> 00:16:47.019
I think this card reader doesn't work.

222
00:16:47.019 --> 00:16:51.019
You find another card reader right now to swipe my card and prove my innocence.

223
00:16:51.019 --> 00:16:53.399
Because why possibly be fake?

224
00:16:53.399 --> 00:16:54.399
Fine.

225
00:16:54.399 --> 00:16:55.399
Let's just swipe it.

226
00:16:55.399 --> 00:16:59.480
Let her be thoroughly disappointed.

227
00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:05.480
I want to see how a lowly maid like you can come up with $1,500,000.

228
00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:06.480
Huh?

229
00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:07.480
Do it.

230
00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:37.220
What?

231
00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:38.960
Possible.

232
00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:40.960
The black card is actually real?

233
00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:43.960
How could a maid like you have a black card?

234
00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:46.019
You must have stolen it.

235
00:17:46.019 --> 00:17:47.019
Nonsense.

236
00:17:47.019 --> 00:17:50.019
King Alan himself gave me this card.

237
00:17:50.019 --> 00:17:53.019
King Alan's status is so noble.

238
00:17:53.019 --> 00:17:56.019
How could you possibly be his partner?

239
00:17:56.019 --> 00:17:59.019
No wonder now she has black cards.

240
00:17:59.019 --> 00:18:02.019
The royal family money is practically limitless.

241
00:18:02.019 --> 00:18:11.119
Christine, you were a bond pretending that you were innocent.

242
00:18:11.119 --> 00:18:12.119
Pure.

243
00:18:12.119 --> 00:18:15.119
Turns out you were just holding out for a better price.

244
00:18:15.119 --> 00:18:18.119
King Alan was really satisfied with you.

245
00:18:18.119 --> 00:18:21.309
He even gave you a black card.

246
00:18:21.309 --> 00:18:23.309
Don't make yourself cry.

247
00:18:24.309 --> 00:18:25.309
Give me a filthy hand.

248
00:18:25.309 --> 00:18:32.230
Show me.

249
00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:34.410
You.

250
00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:35.410
Funny it's worth it.

251
00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:36.410
I ever heard.

252
00:18:36.410 --> 00:18:39.890
King Alan's status is so noble.

253
00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:41.890
How could you possibly be his partner?

254
00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:43.890
You don't sell her nothing.

255
00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:46.890
Otherwise, I will tarnish your reputation.

256
00:18:46.890 --> 00:19:06.490
Did you hear this woman?

257
00:19:06.490 --> 00:19:08.490
She said she's the partner of the Wolf King.

258
00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:09.490
Such a big deal.

259
00:19:09.490 --> 00:19:11.490
Why didn't we hear about it in the news?

260
00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:15.519
It's because we didn't want to announce it so soon.

261
00:19:15.519 --> 00:19:16.519
Ugh.

262
00:19:16.519 --> 00:19:18.000
Sing excuses.

263
00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.089
I'm embarrassed for you.

264
00:19:21.089 --> 00:19:30.740
If you're really his Majesty's companion, why did he let you wander around them all alone?

265
00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:32.740
The slut dearest to call King Lycan by name.

266
00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:34.740
Justin, you're the boss.

267
00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:35.740
Charge her.

268
00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:36.740
On your knees.

269
00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:47.319
Alan, here is supposed to spare you.

270
00:19:47.319 --> 00:19:49.890
They've fallen into my head.

271
00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:52.369
Tonight, I'm going to screw to death.

272
00:19:52.369 --> 00:19:58.369
Justin, what about we just disfigure your pretty face so she can't seduce men anymore?

273
00:19:58.369 --> 00:19:59.400
No.

274
00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.400
Take her to Black Wind Tribe.

275
00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:02.950
Look.

276
00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:06.000
I have a plan.

277
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000
Kristen, I sense that Alan is coming quickly.

278
00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:17.119
You can scream all you want.

279
00:20:17.119 --> 00:20:19.190
Nobody will save you, bitch.

280
00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:33.359
Who dares to insult the future Lycan Queen?

281
00:20:33.359 --> 00:20:36.359
Your Majesty, this is a misunderstanding.

282
00:20:36.359 --> 00:20:38.359
Kristen, are you hurt?

283
00:20:38.359 --> 00:20:40.720
Tell me what happened.

284
00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:43.319
I tried to find some earrings.

285
00:20:43.319 --> 00:20:46.319
But then the clerk told me that I'm not qualified to buy jewelry from this store.

286
00:20:46.319 --> 00:20:48.319
And more so.

287
00:20:48.319 --> 00:20:52.740
Who started questioning the authenticity of the black cards you gave me?

288
00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:56.789
She's lying right here.

289
00:20:56.789 --> 00:20:58.789
Yeah, I asked for your input.

290
00:20:58.789 --> 00:21:01.130
This is my fault.

291
00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:04.200
But I'm not publicly announcing your identity.

292
00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:06.740
Have you found her multiplying?

293
00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:11.160
You said that she was unqualified to purchase from this store, correct?

294
00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:16.259
Yes.

295
00:21:16.259 --> 00:21:19.259
Purchase this mall and its entirety in Kristen's name.

296
00:21:19.259 --> 00:21:22.990
Your Majesty.

297
00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:25.079
The mall has been transferred to Kristen's name.

298
00:21:25.079 --> 00:21:31.539
From now on, you can come here whenever you wish.

299
00:21:31.539 --> 00:21:33.539
Take whatever you like, without pain.

300
00:21:33.539 --> 00:21:36.299
Your Majesty, hear me.

301
00:21:36.299 --> 00:21:43.259
You are fired.

302
00:21:43.259 --> 00:21:46.259
And if I ever as much see your face again,

303
00:21:46.259 --> 00:21:49.259
I'll have you banished from the werewolf tribe.

304
00:21:49.259 --> 00:22:02.619
Who judge others by their appearance?

305
00:22:02.619 --> 00:22:05.619
I really not fit to work in sales.

306
00:22:05.619 --> 00:22:12.480
I forgive you.

307
00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:19.359
And us for you.

308
00:22:19.359 --> 00:22:23.359
Your Majesty, it's just a misunderstanding.

309
00:22:23.359 --> 00:22:27.359
You will face the consequences of your actions.

310
00:22:27.359 --> 00:22:48.609
Get ready for the coronation as soon as possible.

311
00:22:48.609 --> 00:22:52.339
First, you must meet the elders.

312
00:22:52.339 --> 00:22:59.829
Somebody, make an announcement to the entire werewolf tribe.

313
00:22:59.829 --> 00:23:03.829
I want everyone to know that Kristen is to be my future queen

314
00:23:03.829 --> 00:23:06.829
and the future mother of the tribe.

315
00:23:06.829 --> 00:23:08.829
All right, your grace.

316
00:23:08.829 --> 00:23:13.529
Kristen, I will make this coronation happen as soon as possible.

317
00:23:13.529 --> 00:23:16.529
But first, you have to meet the elders.

318
00:23:16.529 --> 00:23:25.240
Bitch, Christine.

319
00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:27.240
How could she become queen of the lichen?

320
00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:28.240
Damn whore.

321
00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:30.240
It's all because of you.

322
00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:32.400
The queen tribe is finished.

323
00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:34.400
She'll poison Ellen's mind.

324
00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:36.400
Come down, Chief.

325
00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:38.400
Don't forget, she's not about for blood.

326
00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:42.400
I have a way to ensure that woman doesn't become queen.

327
00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:43.660
Yes.

328
00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:45.660
Why did I get this idea?

329
00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:47.660
I'm so clever.

330
00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:48.660
You're so good.

331
00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:52.009
When I finish with Christine, I'll marry you.

332
00:23:52.009 --> 00:23:54.009
I'll make you my Luna.

333
00:23:54.009 --> 00:24:13.880
Yes, the elders are respected, but they're also my subordinates.

334
00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:17.259
They will respect you.

335
00:24:17.259 --> 00:24:32.220
It's your Majesty Ellen.

336
00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:35.700
Please, no need for formalities.

337
00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:44.650
I believe we all know why I've called for this council.

338
00:24:44.650 --> 00:24:47.720
I have finally found my destiny made.

339
00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:49.880
Kristen.

340
00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:52.880
Kristen, these are the three elders that assist me with governing.

341
00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:57.799
Adam, Anthony, and Roy.

342
00:24:57.799 --> 00:25:01.599
Your Majesty Ellen, we have heard that Miss Kristen,

343
00:25:01.599 --> 00:25:05.599
is originally from the Black Wind Tribe.

344
00:25:05.599 --> 00:25:06.599
Is this true?

345
00:25:06.599 --> 00:25:10.210
Well, not anymore, elders.

346
00:25:10.210 --> 00:25:12.400
What does that mean?

347
00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:13.400
Are you not anymore?

348
00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:23.440
Alpha Justin of Black Wind Tribe insulted me and mistreated on numerous occasions, so...

349
00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:30.440
Does this mean Miss Kristen that you do not have alpha bloodline?

350
00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:32.509
Oh, well.

351
00:25:32.509 --> 00:25:34.509
I'm afraid that's correct.

352
00:25:34.509 --> 00:25:37.630
I don't.

353
00:25:37.630 --> 00:25:41.630
I oppose this woman becoming Queen of the Worlds.

354
00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:45.630
She's a bloody idiot, and she does not even have alpha bloodline.

355
00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:54.880
How could she be worthy of your Majesty Ellen?

356
00:25:54.880 --> 00:26:00.880
Elder Anthony, must I remind you that accusing Kristen is disrespecting me.

357
00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:03.299
I dare not.

358
00:26:03.299 --> 00:26:05.299
Your Majesty Ellen.

359
00:26:05.299 --> 00:26:06.299
Do I not speak the truth?

360
00:26:06.299 --> 00:26:08.299
She is not an alpha.

361
00:26:08.299 --> 00:26:14.490
Your Majesty, throughout history, every Queen of the like and dynasty has had alpha lineage.

362
00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:16.519
Please reconsider.

363
00:26:16.519 --> 00:26:18.519
Do not make this woman a Queen.

364
00:26:18.519 --> 00:26:23.519
If you are to be the ruler of a nation, you must not be swayed by personal emotions.

365
00:26:23.519 --> 00:26:29.519
She is the companion that has been chosen by the Moon Goddess, and I love her.

366
00:26:29.519 --> 00:26:32.519
She naturally fits to be my Queen.

367
00:26:32.519 --> 00:26:36.890
I'm here for you.

368
00:26:36.890 --> 00:26:38.890
Your Majesty Ellen.

369
00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:41.890
We fully understand your sentiment.

370
00:26:41.890 --> 00:26:50.079
Of course, you can marry this woman, but there is no need to make her mother of this nation.

371
00:26:50.079 --> 00:26:52.079
That's just ridiculous.

372
00:26:52.079 --> 00:26:54.079
Making her a simple console will suffice.

373
00:26:54.079 --> 00:26:56.079
What?

374
00:26:56.079 --> 00:26:57.079
Enough!

375
00:26:57.079 --> 00:26:59.079
The three elders are clear on my intentions.

376
00:26:59.079 --> 00:27:03.119
I shall marry Kristen and make her my wife, meeting adjourned.

377
00:27:03.119 --> 00:27:07.240
Your Majesty Ellen, of course we cannot stop you.

378
00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:15.240
However, have you forgotten that the late King Lycan had entered you into a marriage contract?

379
00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:17.240
What's a woman named Anna?

380
00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:22.970
Of course, I've not forgotten, but this woman has been deceased for many years.

381
00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:24.970
No, Your Majesty.

382
00:27:24.970 --> 00:27:26.970
She is still alive.

383
00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:27.970
Someone!

384
00:27:27.970 --> 00:27:29.970
Bring this Anna in!

385
00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:54.660
Greetings, Your Majesty Ellen.

386
00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:55.660
I'm Anna.

387
00:27:55.660 --> 00:28:00.660
We went to great lengths to locate the last Miss Anna.

388
00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:07.660
She carries pure Alpha lineage, unlike someone like Kristen.

389
00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:08.660
Silence!

390
00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:12.660
If you wish to remain an elder, you will retract that statement.

391
00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:20.740
Kristen, Anna is my father's foster daughter, and we were betrothed to be married once I was younger.

392
00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:22.740
This was not my original intention.

393
00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:32.140
Your Majesty, the late King left a testament when he appointed you as heir.

394
00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:40.140
If Miss Anna is to be found, you are to marry her and take her as your queen.

395
00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:42.140
Indeed, Your Majesty.

396
00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:48.619
Do you intend to defy this testament and offend the late King, even in the afterlife?

397
00:28:48.619 --> 00:28:49.619
Enough!

398
00:28:49.619 --> 00:28:51.619
I've heard enough of this today.

399
00:28:51.619 --> 00:28:52.619
This is over.

400
00:28:52.619 --> 00:28:54.720
We shall pick this up another day.

401
00:28:54.720 --> 00:29:01.779
Your Majesty, I have no intention of breaking you and your partner apart, but please don't drive me away.

402
00:29:01.779 --> 00:29:04.779
I have nowhere to go and no family left.

403
00:29:04.779 --> 00:29:09.839
Your Majesty, out of our childhood bond, will you let me in?

404
00:29:09.839 --> 00:29:11.839
Childhood bond?

405
00:29:11.839 --> 00:29:19.160
But her state seems like she has nowhere else to go.

406
00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:25.430
Cassius? Your Majesty?

407
00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:28.430
Please, I scored Anna downstairs.

408
00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:29.430
Find her room. She needs to rest.

409
00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:31.430
There's Your Majesty.

410
00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:40.400
Why do I feel like an outsider?
