1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,779
Kristen, I am so sorry. I didn't expect the elders to get agitated.

2
00:00:08,779 --> 00:00:12,779
Because of what? Because you're not the alpha of a bloodline?

3
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:17,480
Look, I should have told you much sooner about the engagement.

4
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:24,940
I understand, really. I do. It's just all so sudden.

5
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:37,920
I'm so confused right now. I don't know what to do.

6
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,920
Calm down, Kristen. Alan doesn't seem to have any feelings for that woman.

7
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,920
The engagement is from the past generation.

8
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:51,920
But how can I not be upset? I don't have an alpha bloodline. And I almost became a long move.

9
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,920
Kristen, don't be sad. You have me, ain't it?

10
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,920
Thank you, Alice.

11
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,920
No matter what happens, I promise. I will not become Alan's mistress.

12
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:08,340
So, you are Kristen? Yes, Miss Anna. How can I help you?
