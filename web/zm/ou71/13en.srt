1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:03,020
Yes, Miss Anna, how can I help you?

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:07,750
A lowly she-wolf like you isn't worthy of Alan's attention.

3
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:10,750
If you know what's good for you, you'll leave him.

4
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:12,750
Alan is just passing a fancy for you.

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,750
I believe when he's done playing, he'll reject you and come back to me.

6
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:18,750
That's so.

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:23,750
Well, if you didn't know, me and Alan are partners, and we love each other.

8
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:26,070
Really?

9
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,070
But Alan once said that he wanted to marry me.

10
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,070
I was his first love after all.

11
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:32,070
What?

12
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:34,070
Like I said, you have no royal blood.

13
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:37,070
Alan would never take you for a wife.

14
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:38,070
Are you done?

15
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,200
If you love him so much, go tell him yourself.

16
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,200
Don't bother talking to me.

17
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:50,429
Hello, did it work?

18
00:00:50,429 --> 00:00:52,590
Alan didn't suspect a thing.

19
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,200
Can a queen will be mine?

20
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,189
Don't be so confident.

21
00:00:58,189 --> 00:01:01,189
All the documents forged by Justin if they're discovered.

22
00:01:01,189 --> 00:01:03,189
We're all down for.

23
00:01:03,189 --> 00:01:04,189
What's there to fear?

24
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:06,189
I'm the daughter of an alpha.

25
00:01:06,189 --> 00:01:08,189
What can Kristen do against me?

26
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:11,799
I'll show Alan what a real woman is like.
