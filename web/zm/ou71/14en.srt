1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:05,750
Alice, I'm going to make his favorite dessert and bring him to his office.

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:08,230
I shouldn't have lost my temper with him today.

3
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:09,750
That's the spirit.

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:10,750
You too, partners.

5
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:26,449
No one can go between you.

6
00:00:26,449 --> 00:00:28,649
Is there anything I can help with?

7
00:00:28,649 --> 00:00:31,649
I'm so grateful that his majesty took me in.

8
00:00:31,649 --> 00:00:33,090
I want to do what I can.

9
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:34,850
Oh, no need Miss Anna.

10
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:42,359
No need to bother you.

11
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:44,880
Is this his majesty's dinner for tonight?

12
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,880
It smells delicious.

13
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,880
Yeah, his majesty loves tomato soup very much.

14
00:00:57,619 --> 00:01:02,340
Since I can't be as much help, I can deliver this personally to his majesty.

15
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:03,500
Of course, no problem.
