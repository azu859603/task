1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:04,769
Come in.

2
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:09,830
Your Majesty, you must be hungry. Please, if you saw before.

3
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:12,830
Miss Anna, why am I seeing you rather than one of the other servants?

4
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:18,829
Oh, please don't blame the servants. It's just that I wanted to do something for you to repay your kindness.

5
00:00:18,829 --> 00:00:21,829
That's very kind of you. Please, just leave the soup there.

6
00:00:21,829 --> 00:00:24,829
Oh, please, eat it quickly before it gets cold.

7
00:00:24,829 --> 00:00:35,009
Miss Anna, please, you don't have to do this.

8
00:00:35,009 --> 00:00:40,009
Your father already saved the king, and for that, I'm in your debt and I will take care of you.

9
00:00:40,009 --> 00:00:45,009
But I shall not marry you as the queen. I already have somebody else in my heart.

10
00:00:45,009 --> 00:00:51,130
Oh, no, Your Majesty. I just wanted to show how grateful I am.

11
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:56,130
Miss Anna, if there's nothing else, please, could you leave my office? I have work to do.

12
00:00:56,130 --> 00:01:00,539
Strange. Why do I feel a bit feverish?

13
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:04,579
Your Majesty, am I not as attractive as her?

14
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:07,579
Miss Anna, please behave.

15
00:01:07,579 --> 00:01:10,579
Your Majesty, but isn't it what you want?

16
00:01:10,579 --> 00:01:12,609
Get out.

17
00:01:12,609 --> 00:01:13,609
But your Majesty...

18
00:01:13,609 --> 00:01:16,659
We're late tonight, so...

19
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:22,890
Could you?
