1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:04,019
Perhaps you should find a chance to explain it to Kristin properly.

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:05,269
You're right.

3
00:00:05,269 --> 00:00:08,330
Cassius!

4
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:11,330
Majesty, what can I do for you?

5
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:13,330
I want this bowl of soup testing.

6
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:16,329
I'm pretty sure that something has been added to it.

7
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:18,710
Of course, Majesty.

8
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:21,899
Bring me the results as soon as you get them, OK?

9
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:22,899
And one more thing.

10
00:00:22,899 --> 00:00:26,899
Tell Anna she's not welcome anywhere near my office ever again,

11
00:00:26,899 --> 00:00:28,899
unless strictly ordered by me.

12
00:00:28,899 --> 00:00:29,899
Of course, Majesty.

13
00:00:29,899 --> 00:00:31,899
It seems the rumors are true.

14
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:34,899
His Majesty and Miss Kristin had a fight because of Anna.

15
00:00:34,899 --> 00:00:42,189
Where have I seen this necklace before?

16
00:00:42,189 --> 00:00:52,479
So familiar.

17
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:53,479
Miss Anna?

18
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:55,119
Miss Anna?

19
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:59,170
Cassius.

20
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:02,170
And I'm here on his Majesty's orders.

21
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:04,170
Open the door.

22
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:07,159
What now? I haven't done anything.

23
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:09,159
If his Majesty wants me to leave, I'll leave.

24
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:13,159
Miss Anna, when his Majesty gives you an order, you listen.

25
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:16,159
Otherwise you are disrespecting the royal family.

26
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,159
Do you understand it?

27
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,900
Fine.

28
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:20,900
What do you want?

29
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:21,900
I'm listening.

30
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,900
Isn't this necklace only for those of the direct bloodline of the silver moon tribe?

31
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:28,180
Could it be Anna?

32
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:30,180
Is the sister I've been searching for?

33
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,180
Always is.
