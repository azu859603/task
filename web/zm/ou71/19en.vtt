00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.269
Kristen, why are you eating alone? Where's his Majesty Allen?

2
00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:16.899
Excuse me, what's with all these questions?

3
00:00:16.899 --> 00:00:21.460
Oh, I get it. You don't like me because I'm His Majesty's fiancee.

4
00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:27.300
But you know, the engagement wasn't even my decision, and I only admire His Majesty Allen.

5
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:34.890
Goodness, why is Miss Kristen so mean to Miss Anna? Miss Anna is also a beautiful soul.

6
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.600
If you have something to say on the matter, you can say it to my face and not the gusset behind my back.

7
00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.229
I'm not deaf.

8
00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:45.829
Kristen, if you're mad at me, you may hate me or hit me.

9
00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:51.539
But why take it out on poor servants? Your help is not needed right now. You may go.

10
00:00:51.539 --> 00:01:02.020
Who is this your definition? Miss Anna?

11
00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:14.420
Kristen, you're all minus? Myself.

12
00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:29.450
I'll be before you go. Make me do!

13
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:30.650
What's going on here?
