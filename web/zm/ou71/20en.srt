1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
What's going on here?

2
00:00:02,029 --> 00:00:08,529
Your Majesty, I don't know what I've done to offend Kristen, but I just wanted to give her coffee, but you pushed me away.

3
00:00:09,029 --> 00:00:10,529
What are you talking about?

4
00:00:10,529 --> 00:00:14,029
I didn't even touch you! You just spilled it by yourself!

5
00:00:14,529 --> 00:00:18,030
Alpha Cassius can testify for me. Your Majesty.

6
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:20,530
Cassius, can't you explain?

7
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:25,030
Alpha Cassius, you were right there. You saw everything. Please tell his Majesty the truth.

8
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:33,030
Perhaps as Miss Anna said, Miss Kristen accidentally bumped into her and spooked the coffee.

9
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:36,030
Why are you lying? You saw everything!

10
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:39,530
Then perhaps it was just an accident. Sit down and finish your meal.

11
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:43,030
I didn't push her! Why don't you believe me?

12
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:46,289
Like you didn't believe me last night, Kristen?

13
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:59,990
Alan, you don't have to be angry with me or Kristen. She just lost her temper of it.

14
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:06,209
You do not have the right to call me by my name, Miss Anna.

15
00:01:06,209 --> 00:01:12,480
Do you really believe this woman of uncertain origin?

16
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:16,480
Of course not, but I can't let the elders find out they're investigating.
