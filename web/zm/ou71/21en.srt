1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,589
I haven't said really well that she just pops up.

2
00:00:03,589 --> 00:00:06,589
Maybe accepting Alan in a first place was a mistake.

3
00:00:06,589 --> 00:00:09,589
Oh, like Kristen. Don't think like that.

4
00:00:09,589 --> 00:00:11,589
Alan misunderstood because Cassius lied.

5
00:00:11,589 --> 00:00:14,589
After all, Cassius is his right-hand man.

6
00:00:14,589 --> 00:00:16,589
You're right.

7
00:00:16,589 --> 00:00:18,589
But why would Cassius help Anna?

8
00:00:18,589 --> 00:00:20,820
Could it be...

9
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,820
He likes her. Not that's absurd.

10
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,820
And you can't give up on Alan like this, Kristen.

11
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,820
I thought woman not only was Alan's first love,

12
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,820
but she also got a reaction from him.

13
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,170
I feel like he's lying to me.

14
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:37,170
There must be some misunderstanding.

15
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,170
You can talk openly with Alan, Kristen.

16
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,170
You canceled this alone.

17
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:46,460
You're right. Okay, I'll go see him tonight.

18
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:52,759
Christine, if you want to know about your origins,

19
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:55,759
come alone to Blackmin tribe.

20
00:00:55,759 --> 00:01:00,659
What? Justin claims to know about my origins.

21
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:03,490
Why he didn't tell me before.

22
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:05,489
Don't believe him.

23
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:07,489
Kristen, he's definitely trying to deceive you.

24
00:01:07,489 --> 00:01:10,489
He's seen you going to the Queen and fears her retaliation.

25
00:01:10,489 --> 00:01:13,489
What if he really has some clues about my parents?

26
00:01:13,489 --> 00:01:16,489
I have been searching for mom and dad for so many years.

27
00:01:16,489 --> 00:01:18,489
I just want to know the outcome.

28
00:01:18,489 --> 00:01:20,489
Christine, don't act impulsively.

29
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:25,030
Why don't you ask Alan to send someone to four, you secretly?

30
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:29,129
No. This is my own business. I'll handle it myself.

31
00:01:29,129 --> 00:01:30,959
Okay.

32
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:32,959
But don't find me tricks.

33
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:34,959
All in some Alan I can see.
