00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:12,900
Come in, Christine. Long time no see. I knew you'd come.

2
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:21,199
Cut to the chase, Justin. What do you know? And don't even dare to trick me, or I will call Alan immediately.

3
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:31,449
Let me look at you. This is a majesty pamper you every day. You look much sexier than before.

4
00:00:31,449 --> 00:00:40,899
Justin, I don't want to hear any of this nonsense. What do you want? To chop off your feet.

5
00:00:40,899 --> 00:00:50,399
You won't make me afraid of Alan. Recently, I heard about his affair with his fiancÃ©, Miss Anna.

6
00:00:50,399 --> 00:01:02,590
You won't be that arrogant bitch anymore. You see this emblem? Christine, you're a descendant of traitors.

7
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:14,430
What do you mean, Justin? This is a symbol of traitors tribe, like your old family.

8
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:21,939
No, no, this can't be. If Alan knows about this, you're finished.

9
00:01:21,939 --> 00:01:29,670
You will never become a queen. He'll put you in the prison and torture you.
