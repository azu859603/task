1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:03,020
Your Majesty, may I come in?

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:06,940
The test results of the suit.

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:07,940
The back.

4
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:15,099
Ah, take a look.

5
00:00:15,099 --> 00:00:18,100
They're dared to add aphrodisiacs to the suit.

6
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:23,100
Your Majesty, is it true that it's possible and are tampered with your suit?

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:28,769
This necklace is identical to one Kristen while the other day.

8
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:30,929
You seem to care a lot about Anna.

9
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:32,929
She's so pitiful, I feel.

10
00:00:32,929 --> 00:00:34,600
Sorry for her.

11
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,600
The suit is fine.

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,100
You may leave.

13
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:51,689
Your Majesty.

14
00:00:51,689 --> 00:00:54,770
What?

15
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:56,770
Am I really betrayed his daughter?

16
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:58,770
No, I don't believe it.

17
00:00:58,770 --> 00:00:59,770
I have to find Alan.

18
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:00,770
Kristen, look over there.

19
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:02,770
Aren't those palace guards?

20
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:04,769
Did Alan send someone to find you?

21
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:08,219
We're here on orders from King Alan to apprehend Kristen.

22
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:09,219
Have you seen her?

23
00:01:09,219 --> 00:01:11,219
Oh, no. I haven't seen her.

24
00:01:11,219 --> 00:01:12,219
What?
