00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
Kristen, my red footsteps, they seem to be searching for you.

2
00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:05.000
Hurry, run!

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Thank you, Alice. I'm so glad to have you on my side.

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.000
So where is she?

5
00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.320
If we can't even find a woman, we are worthless.

6
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.320
Stop talking nonsense and find her.

7
00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.320
If this traitor escapes, we'll all be in trouble.

8
00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:23.260
Why do I feel such a strong headache?

9
00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.760
Ever since I'm so Justin, I've felt something's wrong.

10
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.260
I'm not Kristen. You're probably awakening your powers.

11
00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.259
Congratulations!

12
00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.340
Wait! I heard something!

13
00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:41.590
She must be there. Let's go together. She can't escape.

14
00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:52.320
Agreed.

15
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.350
You too.

16
00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:59.409
But you have always had my people secretly taken. When you left the palace, it reported to me.

17
00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:01.630
You frightened me, Kristen.

18
00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.950
If something happened to you, how could I live on?

19
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:09.019
So there was God. You didn't actually send them to capture me.

20
00:01:09.019 --> 00:01:12.019
Kristen, why would I send my guards to capture you?

21
00:01:12.019 --> 00:01:15.340
Stay here. Don't move. I will handle this.

22
00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.340
I will handle this.
