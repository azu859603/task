00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:08,449
What is this guy I do not recognize you three as part of my guard service shut up. What are you now?

2
00:00:08,449 --> 00:00:10,449
Are you the light and king get up

3
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:18,219
Unfortunately for you, I am the like in King

4
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:25,440
Sorry, I'm at his seat. We're late. Take these away for interrogation. Find out who's behind this

5
00:00:29,859 --> 00:00:30,899
Kristen

6
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:36,710
Kristen I shouldn't have got angry at you the other night and about Anna. She put something in my soup

7
00:00:37,109 --> 00:00:40,009
That's the reason that I I reacted the way I did

8
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:47,649
She also told me that she was your first love, Alan. It's that true. I haven't seen Anna since I was barely eight years old

9
00:00:47,909 --> 00:00:52,329
So that's it. I shouldn't have doubted you. I

10
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:57,880
Went to the black wind trap to see Justin because he told me, you know something about my parents

11
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:03,299
He also told me that I'm a descendant of traitors. So I didn't dare come see you as to a friend. Kristen

12
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:07,640
Justin's words are not trustworthy and even if they were

13
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:13,909
It's not your fault. No, it is my fault as well. I shouldn't have doubted you
