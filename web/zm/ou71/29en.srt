1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
Ms. Anna is my biological, long lost sister.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:11,250
My word! With Anna's merits and with his Majesty, Alan?

3
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,730
What? It's a match made in heaven!

4
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:17,710
No wonder he was covering up for Anna's lies earlier.

5
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:19,870
Cusius, do you have proof?

6
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:21,710
Of course I do your Majesty.

7
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:27,070
This token only loaves that our direct descendant of the silver moon tribe

8
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:29,469
can possess such a token.

9
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:30,750
The King knows this.

10
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,950
He also knows I possess one and who else possesses one.

11
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:38,049
Ms. Anna, my sister, it's identical.

12
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,960
Krista, what's the matter?

13
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,600
Oh, that's impossible. That's my necklace.

14
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,119
Kristan, how could you say that?

15
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:51,039
This clearly belongs to me.

16
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,960
I've had it for many years and Cassius just happened to see it a few days ago.

17
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,880
Ms. Kristan, please stop lying.

18
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,240
I'm not lying.

19
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,560
Do you think I wouldn't recognize a necklace?

20
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:07,120
I've been wearing my whole life and I actually lost it just yesterday.

21
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,840
I've been searching all over the palace for it.

22
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,640
And to my surprise, I find it on you, Ms. Anna.

23
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,000
Do you have any proof?

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,959
Everybody knows, Kristan, that you're from the Black Wind Tribe.

25
00:01:19,939 --> 00:01:22,180
If you've been wearing it all this time,

26
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:25,379
people who know you should have seen it, right?

27
00:01:25,379 --> 00:01:28,019
I happen to know someone from the Black Wind Tribe.

28
00:01:28,019 --> 00:01:29,219
I can ask her.

29
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:32,260
You're Majesty Allen, esteemed elders.

30
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:35,540
I'm Amelia, the future lunar of the Black Wind Tribe.

31
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:39,620
I testify that this woman has been on our tribe for many years.

32
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:43,409
And I've never seen her with this necklace.
