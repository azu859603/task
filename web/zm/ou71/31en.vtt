1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
If you insist, but I shall not give up on Kristen.

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
She's my destined mate, and nobody shall separate us.

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
We shall not let some third person ruin what we have.

4
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.699
I used to doubt Alan. I feel so ashamed.

5
00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.929
No, I don't want to be burned.

6
00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:22.949
Oh, my Kristen.

7
00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.949
You're pressuring Alan.

8
00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:26.949
This isn't good.

9
00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:31.109
Alan, hearing you say this, it's already enough.

10
00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.179
I'm willing to leave this palace as long as I know that you have me in your heart.

11
00:00:36.179 --> 00:00:39.179
Please, for your own sake, just reject me.

12
00:00:39.179 --> 00:00:43.179
Kristen, no. Nothing can separate us.

13
00:00:43.179 --> 00:00:46.179
You are my partner.

14
00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:52.189
Cassius, I am very disappointed in you.

15
00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:57.189
Majesty, just because of some necklace, you believe in all of Anna's lies.

16
00:00:57.189 --> 00:01:00.189
Your Majesty, how can you say such things?

17
00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:02.189
I really am his sister.

18
00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:06.500
Bring the evidence.

19
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:19.849
Alpha Justin from the Blackwind tribe found Kristen just a few days ago,

20
00:01:19.849 --> 00:01:22.849
claiming that she had treacherous blood.

21
00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:28.849
This made me suspicious and immediately reminded me that perhaps she's from the Silvermoon tribe.

22
00:01:28.849 --> 00:01:31.849
Then I remember you and your search for your sister.

23
00:01:31.849 --> 00:01:38.849
So I had someone examine a cup, taking your DNA and finding a match with Kristen.

24
00:01:38.849 --> 00:01:41.849
The results are all there. See for yourself.

25
00:01:41.849 --> 00:01:54.069
The DNA matches. You lied to me.

26
00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:57.069
And where did you get that necklace from?

27
00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:00.069
I didn't deceive you. This really is my necklace.

28
00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:04.069
Maybe, maybe we're just lost siblings, you know?

29
00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:10.870
I lost my parents when I was nine years old, and I don't remember having two sisters.

30
00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:15.139
It's Kristen, please.

31
00:02:15.139 --> 00:02:18.430
Sister, I didn't know.

32
00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:27.289
I'm just so happy to have a brother.

33
00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:32.020
Now, can you accept Kristen as your queen?

34
00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.020
She's also a descendant of an Alpha.

35
00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.020
Your Majesty, I was wrong. I did lie.

36
00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:43.020
I found this necklace in the garden, but I wanted to have a family so badly.

37
00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:48.629
Please, your Majesty, please forgive me for the sake of my deceased father.

38
00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:50.629
I genuinely like you.

39
00:02:50.629 --> 00:03:01.889
Indeed, your Majesty, regardless of anything, her father was a lifesaver to the late King. Please spare her.

40
00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:12.770
Hmm. Even if I can't become queen, I will still be Alan's woman, enjoying wealth and prosperity.

41
00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.770
Fine. I won't punish you. But this is the last time.

42
00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:22.770
You've already lied to me once about being my true love. You have crossed my bottom line.

43
00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.770
Your Majesty, there's something else I need to tell you.

44
00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.770
Because I thought she was my sister, I was protecting her.

45
00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.770
A few days ago, she said Kristen accidentally bumped into her and spilled the coffee. That's not true.

46
00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:39.770
She did it deliberately. She lied. The so did I. Please forgive me, your Majesty.

47
00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:43.469
What I can't believe is.

48
00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:52.469
Even if you have feelings for King Alan, you mustn't resort to such low tactics.

49
00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:57.469
As the future queen of the lichens, you must be dignified.

50
00:03:57.469 --> 00:04:11.939
I'm sorry, your Majesty. I got confused.

51
00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:14.939
Kristen, she's lying. I can feel it.

52
00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:23.579
I was told you no, Kristen. It's our ability. True heart. Once we hear a lie, we get a headache.

53
00:04:23.579 --> 00:05:00.970
Miss Anna, I knew your father. Tom, he was a brave man, and when I was in danger, he stood in front of me without hesitation.

54
00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:07.970
If you were his daughter, you would have inherited some of his courageous traits, not playing these silly games.

55
00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:09.970
Your Majesty, you...

56
00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:15.970
Understand your Majesty, you're right. I will remember your teachings and strive to learn from my father.

57
00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.970
I swear I will never do anything to dishonor my father's reputation again.

58
00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:22.800
You imp...

59
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:28.350
Elder Anthony, what wrong?

60
00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:37.670
Have met Alpha Tom, because Alpha Tom passed away long before his Majesty Alan was even born.

61
00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:46.300
You don't know when your old father died? Not be the real Miss Anna, almost.

62
00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:55.500
Your Majesty, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to deceive you, but I was instructed to do all this by someone...

63
00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:01.860
Tell me who instructed you to do this, and be honest, confess, and I shall be lenient.

64
00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.300
I was instructed.

65
00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:28.319
Must have activated when she tried to reveal the mastermind behind her plans.

66
00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:34.319
Who would do such a thing? Who could be so ruthless? She didn't deserve to die like this.

67
00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:39.819
I shall investigate this further for now, meeting adjourned.

68
00:06:39.819 --> 00:06:49.699
Yes, Your Majesty.

69
00:06:49.699 --> 00:06:54.850
I already have a suspect in mind. It must be the person that tried to get...

70
00:06:54.850 --> 00:07:05.110
Only he and Amelia wish me dead. And the other day he tried to convince me that I'm a traitor.

71
00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:11.240
It's most likely him. But we can't just accuse him and start a war with them.

72
00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:14.240
With that, Black Wind tried without having any solid evidence.

73
00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:17.240
But don't worry, Cassie and I will take care of you.

74
00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:21.240
Sister, I will protect you. You can trust us.

75
00:07:24.639 --> 00:07:35.189
Brother, I'm not afraid. I trust you.

76
00:07:35.189 --> 00:07:41.189
Didn't you say the plan was going to succeed? Why, as Christine become the lunar?

77
00:07:41.189 --> 00:07:49.350
The idiot you found almost exposed us. If Allen figures it out, we're all going to war.

78
00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:57.339
Justin, we still have one last resort. This time, it will definitely work.

79
00:07:57.339 --> 00:07:59.339
I know some powerful witch.

80
00:07:59.339 --> 00:08:05.980
I will go find her. She has some black magic to deal with King Allen.

81
00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:18.790
I smell a scent of a werewolf. How dare a werewolf, trust pass to my territory.

82
00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:25.050
Aren't you afraid of death? Great witch. I've come to seek in cooperation.

83
00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:29.209
I'm willing to sell my soul and seek your hell.

84
00:08:29.209 --> 00:08:31.209
I know what you want, child.

85
00:08:31.209 --> 00:08:53.669
Grip your blood on this crystal ball and I will give you what you desire.

86
00:08:53.669 --> 00:08:57.669
These are potions that can fulfill your wishes. That's great.

87
00:08:57.669 --> 00:09:01.669
Remember, after you go to hell, I will come for you.

88
00:09:03.669 --> 00:09:24.379
In his Kristen, his Majesty Allen has ordered a new batch of clothes for you.

89
00:09:24.379 --> 00:09:26.470
Do you want to try them on immediately?

90
00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:30.470
That's all I've been doing lately, Ray. Just try not on your clothes.

91
00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:33.470
I'm not sure that King Allen has been sent in with me instead.

92
00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:37.470
Your Majesty, Kristen. His Majesty Allen is working overtime for you.

93
00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:40.470
He'll be delighted. Shall we?

94
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:42.470
Courage. Take it to my bedroom.

95
00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:58.539
Excuse me? He'll look kind of familiar. How about you seeing you somewhere?

96
00:09:58.539 --> 00:10:04.370
Hi, Miss Kristen. You must have mistaken me with someone else.

97
00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:21.179
My ability is activated. The man is lying. He's suspicious.

98
00:10:21.179 --> 00:10:22.179
Is the vehicle Allen?

99
00:10:22.179 --> 00:10:30.279
Oh, he's too busy investigating Justin. I probably just thought we're thinking.

100
00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:41.190
Of course. I know such lowly tricks won't fool you.

101
00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:45.440
But, my target this time is not you, Kristen.

102
00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:49.440
With Kristen's hair, I can transform into her through witchcraft.

103
00:10:49.440 --> 00:11:00.850
Kristen, what brings you here?

104
00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:04.879
Oh, I made courage for Allen, and I wanted to give it to him.

105
00:11:04.879 --> 00:11:11.370
That's so sweet. Go ahead.

106
00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:25.129
This is indeed, but Cassius didn't recognize me as a fan.

107
00:11:25.129 --> 00:11:27.220
Kristen, I thought you were resting.

108
00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:30.450
Darling, how can I not come in and keep you company?

109
00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:33.450
Well, you're working. You must be hungry.

110
00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:35.450
I made you some porridge.

111
00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:57.289
This is delicious.

112
00:11:57.289 --> 00:11:58.289
That's it.

113
00:11:58.289 --> 00:11:59.320
That's it. That's it.

114
00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:01.320
That's it. Is Allen there? I have something to tell you.

115
00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:04.320
Kristen, what are you doing here? You were just with the king, Miss.

116
00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:06.320
What? No, I just arrived.

117
00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:16.490
Assassin, behind us. Emergency. Help me, Mark.

118
00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:19.129
Help me, Mark. Help me, Mark.

119
00:12:19.129 --> 00:12:23.149
The assassin's gone through the window. Do you stay with him here?

120
00:12:23.149 --> 00:12:26.149
Call the doctor. I'm going to go after the assassin.

121
00:12:26.149 --> 00:12:44.669
Don't worry, Miss Kristen. King Allen is healthy.

122
00:12:44.669 --> 00:12:46.669
He's just unconscious for now.

123
00:12:46.669 --> 00:12:51.620
Sister, we searched the entire area looking for suspicious characters,

124
00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:53.620
but we didn't find anyone. I'm sorry.

125
00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:58.259
The assassin disguised as you has got away.

126
00:12:58.259 --> 00:13:17.460
Next on water, I'm Kristen, your partner. Ask your wolf.

127
00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:23.309
My wolf. He's not responding.

128
00:13:23.309 --> 00:13:26.440
How is this possible? Doctor, please examine me.

129
00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:35.299
Yes, Alpha Cassius. It's a very rare dark magic.

130
00:13:35.299 --> 00:13:38.299
His wolf has fallen into a deep sleep.

131
00:13:38.299 --> 00:13:44.200
Miss Kristen, please, don't get upset. We will find a solution.

132
00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:47.580
Allen, please look at me. Look at me, Allen.

133
00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:50.220
I'm Kristen. Martin, do you remember?

134
00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:55.110
Cassius, who is this? Your Majesty, it's true.

135
00:13:55.110 --> 00:14:00.110
Miss Kristen, indeed, is your partner. You are deeply in love.

136
00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:02.559
Is that so?

137
00:14:02.559 --> 00:14:06.559
You've had a spell put on your mind, and that's why you can't remember her.

138
00:14:06.559 --> 00:14:13.659
I trust only my wolf, and so my wolf arises.

139
00:14:13.659 --> 00:14:17.659
You let nobody near me, and escort this lady away from me.

140
00:14:17.659 --> 00:14:22.659
Your Majesty, no, no. You and Miss Kristen are deeply in love.

141
00:14:22.659 --> 00:14:26.659
You cannot do this. We will find a solution very soon.

142
00:14:26.659 --> 00:14:30.139
Cassius, do not disobey me.

143
00:14:30.139 --> 00:14:34.779
So you really don't trust me, don't you? Fine.

144
00:14:34.779 --> 00:14:55.279
Kristen, don't be so impulsive. I know you're upset.

145
00:14:55.279 --> 00:15:01.659
Kristen, you can stay in the palace. You'll be safe. Kristen, you're my only sister.

146
00:15:01.659 --> 00:15:06.399
Why, he doesn't believe me. I just can't take this anymore.

147
00:15:06.399 --> 00:15:12.399
Since my fault, I did the assassin get close to you because he was impersonating you.

148
00:15:12.399 --> 00:15:17.559
I didn't know it was my fault. His Majesty will remember you again.

149
00:15:17.559 --> 00:15:24.820
I can't stay in this house anymore. I'm leaving.

150
00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:28.100
Kristen, you have to stay here, Kristen. I am the alpha.

151
00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:34.100
I am His Majesty's right-hand man. If I declare for you to be safe here, you are safe.

152
00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.139
Stay here with me.

153
00:15:36.139 --> 00:15:52.129
Stop right there. What's the matter?

154
00:15:52.129 --> 00:15:58.129
You bunch. You used a flange in front of us, thinking you could become a queen.

155
00:15:58.129 --> 00:16:02.129
Too bad. His Majesty only sees you as a plaything.

156
00:16:02.129 --> 00:16:06.220
Move aside. I don't have time for pity people like you.

157
00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:10.220
You humiliated us before. Now you want to leave? No way.

158
00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:14.220
I didn't humiliate you. You were the ones blinded by people like Anna.

159
00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:18.220
Even gossiping about me. Put her head in the dirt.

160
00:16:32.399 --> 00:16:37.460
His Majesty abandoned her. Tear her and throw them in the river.

161
00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:40.460
His Majesty will not protect you now.

162
00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:46.009
Is going on here.

163
00:16:46.009 --> 00:16:49.009
Anyone disrespecting Princess Kristen is fired.

164
00:16:49.009 --> 00:16:56.379
Is going on here.

165
00:16:56.379 --> 00:16:59.379
Anyone disrespecting Princess Kristen is fired.

166
00:16:59.379 --> 00:17:05.420
Alpha Cassius, what if we do wrong? His Majesty has announced her departure.

167
00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:07.420
She's not the future queen.

168
00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:11.420
First of all, His Majesty has not rejected Princess Kristen.

169
00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:16.420
Second of all, I forbid you from engaging in baseless gossip.

170
00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:20.829
Finally, even if she's not the queen, she's my sister.

171
00:17:20.829 --> 00:17:29.069
Go. Go.

172
00:17:29.069 --> 00:17:35.380
I'm sorry, Kristen. I never expected them to disrespect you.

173
00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:43.380
Brother, I still want to leave the palace.

174
00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:47.380
Helen doesn't love me anymore. And I can take care of myself.

175
00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:51.380
I don't want to hear this rumors. I have my pride.

176
00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:55.380
Kristen, I'll send the guards to protect you, but be careful.

177
00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:58.920
I'm going to find the assassin and the antidote.

178
00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:14.779
Perficient.

179
00:18:14.779 --> 00:18:16.029
Please.

180
00:18:16.029 --> 00:18:21.029
But it's sparsely populated here. I've always been unsafe, Kristen.

181
00:18:21.029 --> 00:18:27.259
Let's go back. It's getting late. What's that?

182
00:18:27.259 --> 00:18:43.140
Finally, I'll get you. You can't escape my grip.

183
00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:57.019
Christine, you didn't expect to see me, huh?

184
00:18:57.019 --> 00:19:01.490
It's you!

185
00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:06.099
Tell me. How does it feel to be abandoned?

186
00:19:06.099 --> 00:19:09.099
His Majesty threw you away like garbage.

187
00:19:09.099 --> 00:19:13.099
If you hadn't rejected me before, it wouldn't end like this.

188
00:19:13.099 --> 00:19:19.259
You asshole. See you were orchestrating those whole things right from the beginning.

189
00:19:19.259 --> 00:19:23.259
Now even if I knew I would end up like this and become this long wolf,

190
00:19:23.259 --> 00:19:27.259
I would still reject you a thousand times over.

191
00:19:27.259 --> 00:19:31.539
Even now, you dare to tell you like this.

192
00:19:31.539 --> 00:19:35.240
I will show you my real power.

193
00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:37.240
You're nothing.

194
00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:50.059
Fuck you.

195
00:19:50.059 --> 00:19:51.599
Alpha.

196
00:19:51.599 --> 00:19:55.039
His Majesty is coming to inspect our tribe.

197
00:19:55.039 --> 00:19:57.039
Again?

198
00:19:57.039 --> 00:20:06.750
Lucky bitch. Wait until I put out the fire. I will come after you.

199
00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:12.750
Don't expect his Majesty, Alan, to save you. He doesn't even know who you are.

200
00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:21.170
Kristen, we must escape while we have the chance.

201
00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:35.640
Your Majesty, King Alan. What brings you back to our tribe?

202
00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:37.859
Inspection again?

203
00:20:37.859 --> 00:20:40.220
Again?

204
00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:43.309
What do you mean? So are you saying that I've been here before?

205
00:20:43.309 --> 00:20:49.539
No. I forgot that Alan forgot about Christine. I can't let him remember that bitch.

206
00:20:49.539 --> 00:20:55.140
It's my mistake here. Majesty hasn't had your dinner yet, have you?

207
00:20:55.140 --> 00:21:00.900
I have prepared for you a big feast. You may like it.

208
00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:06.900
I'm here investigating the assassin that poisoned me, and since then my wolf has been in a deep sleep.

209
00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:09.900
All clues point to your tribe, Alpha Justin.

210
00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:18.799
How is that possible? Is there a traitor in our tribe? Rest assured, I will take care of it.

211
00:21:18.799 --> 00:21:21.279
Justin, that bitch escaped.

212
00:21:21.279 --> 00:21:30.880
Can't you see that I'm hosting his Majesty? Get out.

213
00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:35.099
I didn't know. I'm sorry your Majesty. I will leave now.

214
00:21:35.099 --> 00:21:41.839
Stop. What was that you were saying about? A Kristen? Who is this?

215
00:21:41.839 --> 00:21:45.839
Just a criminal in our tribe. Your Majesty, you don't need to worry about her.

216
00:21:45.839 --> 00:21:51.099
Yes, she's just a criminal, Your Majesty. Shall we continue with dinner?

217
00:21:51.099 --> 00:21:57.099
If there is a criminal on the loose, I suggest you go and find her and bring her back for questioning.

218
00:21:57.099 --> 00:22:08.380
Yes, yes, Your Majesty. Better not mess it up. Otherwise we're all finished.

219
00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:21.440
He already forgot her. We should be fine. Your Majesty, you see it's her, but she's definitely not the criminal who tried to kill you.

220
00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:24.569
We've had her locked up here for over a month.

221
00:22:24.569 --> 00:22:29.700
A month? Then why does she still have his face covering? Remove it immediately.

222
00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:33.700
Your Majesty, there's no need. Criminal will only dirty your eyes.

223
00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:55.849
Are you deaf? I said remove it. What crime has she committed?

224
00:22:55.849 --> 00:23:01.849
Your Majesty, Alan, it's nothing serious. You don't have to worry since you've seen her. I'll take her away.

225
00:23:01.849 --> 00:23:07.519
No. Untie her. I have questions that I would like to personally ask her.

226
00:23:07.519 --> 00:23:12.660
Alan, it's me, Kristen. Don't you remember me?

227
00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:21.400
I have to take this call. Offer Justin. Question her.

228
00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:27.400
As you wretch, how dare you scream in front of his Majesty, Alan? He doesn't even recognize you anymore.

229
00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:34.400
Only you and Justin can stood to such disgusting measures to get back at me. You poisoned him.

230
00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:38.400
So what if it is? What can you do to us now, huh?

231
00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:45.009
Do what you want with me. But King Alan never did anything bad to black and try.

232
00:23:45.009 --> 00:23:52.000
What dare you poison him? If not this way, how could we make him forget you, wench?

233
00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:57.000
Amelia, finish her off. If it's Majesty asks, we say she committed suicide.

234
00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.000
Stop or you'll face the ultimate punishment.

235
00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:19.210
I heard everything. Alpha Justin of the Black Wind Tribe admitted to conspiring with his mistress Amelia to assassinate the King Lyakin.

236
00:24:19.210 --> 00:24:27.210
They poisoned his Majesty Alan, hoping to prevent Princess Kristen from becoming queen.

237
00:24:27.210 --> 00:24:34.210
Your Majesty Alan, have mercy, have mercy. It was not my idea. It was all Justin's doing.

238
00:24:34.210 --> 00:24:37.210
Bitch, how dare you drag me down with you.

239
00:24:37.210 --> 00:24:42.210
Arrest these two criminals. They'll meet their fate in our justice system.

240
00:24:42.210 --> 00:24:49.640
Of course I didn't. The werewolf, Poison, has been wearing off for some time.

241
00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:55.640
Cassius came up with a clever plan, and how to expose these traitors as soon as possible.

242
00:24:55.640 --> 00:25:01.640
In future, you won't use such unethical methods, and I'm sorry that we had to put you from such distress.

243
00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:12.660
Creaminess will give up either serve. After the trial is over, I'll make you my queen.

244
00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:30.710
Alpha Justin, you have violated the werewolf constitution, abused personal power, mistreated the werewolf community,

245
00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:33.710
and conspired with your lover to assassinate King Lyakin.

246
00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:39.710
You are sentenced to lifelong exile, expelled from the wolf pack to become a lone wolf.

247
00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:46.710
As for werewolf Amelia, you poisoned King Lyakin, colluded with witches and aggravated crime.

248
00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:48.710
You deserve the death penalty.

249
00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:55.710
But due to forgiveness certificates issued by the victims, his Majesty King Lyakin and Miss Kristen,

250
00:25:55.710 --> 00:26:00.710
you will also be sentenced to lifelong exile, becoming a lone wolf.

251
00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:06.920
What? No, I sacrificed everything, refused to accept.

252
00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:07.920
Court adjourned.

253
00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:19.000
Christine, I've read everything that I've done to you. I really loved you.

254
00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.410
Your love is a joke.

255
00:26:23.410 --> 00:26:29.369
It's a little bit late for that, Justin. I accept your apology.

256
00:26:29.369 --> 00:26:47.490
Your Majesty, you look absolutely stunning today.

257
00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:57.660
King Allen will be amazed.

258
00:26:57.660 --> 00:26:59.660
Actually, maybe King Allen.

259
00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:04.660
Go on, my queen. Don't keep Emperor Allen waiting for too long.

260
00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:27.940
Our King Ly and his Queen Kristen leading out of better future.

261
00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:43.369
I swear by the moon goddess that from this day forward I shall entrust my life and my heart to you entirely.

262
00:27:43.369 --> 00:27:46.369
I shall love you more each day until the end of my days.

263
00:27:46.369 --> 00:27:49.779
And you'll be the stars that illuminate my remaining life.

264
00:27:49.779 --> 00:27:52.299
Will you be my queen?

265
00:27:52.299 --> 00:27:54.609
Yes, I'll be right on.

266
00:27:54.609 --> 00:28:01.039
Your Majesty, kiss the queen.

267
00:28:01.039 --> 00:28:36.309
Because he's in.

268
00:28:36.309 --> 00:28:39.400
And I'll try harder.
