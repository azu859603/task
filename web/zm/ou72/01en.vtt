00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:18.179
Can you, stranger, smell like a veil of whiskey was dumped on you?

2
00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:19.179
Haha.

3
00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:44.890
So the possibility of me and Celine work it together?

4
00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.530
I mean, I am literally dying with Jelzi.

5
00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.170
You too get to work for the male Miranda Priestley.

6
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.170
I mean...

7
00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.170
Yeah.

8
00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.490
Again, please.

9
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:00.490
Oh, thank you.

10
00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:01.490
Oh, Jelzi.

11
00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.489
It's a good boss.

12
00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.170
I understand the pressure that you are under right now.

13
00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.849
You are a top-notch designer, well-known model, very successful businessman.

14
00:01:13.849 --> 00:01:18.329
It's a lot on the plate, sir, but all eyes are on you right now.

15
00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:20.250
You have to get some rest.

16
00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.170
All I do is work.

17
00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:24.170
I can't sleep.

18
00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.010
My mind goes 10,000 miles an hour and, at least with this, I can drink this and it will

19
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:41.540
lead me something to sleep for a while, okay?

20
00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:42.540
We should dance.

21
00:01:42.540 --> 00:02:00.340
My favorite song just came on, so I will take this and I will do is that, you know, shit's

22
00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:06.939
getting a girl dead, so my favorite song, I'm going to have to investigate.

23
00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:14.750
You don't care if anyone sees you, do you?

24
00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.629
I see you short to care about what people think.

25
00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:19.979
Who are you?

26
00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:29.289
It doesn't matter, and me, and you, are you, and now, we're dancing.

27
00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:32.340
I know what you're hearing.

28
00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:39.599
You know this, and you are exactly what I need, and what if I want to tell you that I want

29
00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:40.599
you?
