1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,960
So, do you have any questions about my resume?

2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:11,019
We have a saying in the fashion world.

3
00:00:11,019 --> 00:00:15,019
You wear who you are, and honestly with your presentation right here,

4
00:00:15,019 --> 00:00:18,019
I feel like I don't even need to read your resume.

5
00:00:18,019 --> 00:00:21,019
Does it remember me from last night? That's a good thing.

6
00:00:21,019 --> 00:00:26,019
But I know I've not majored in fashion.

7
00:00:26,019 --> 00:00:30,019
I apologize for not making myself presentable.

8
00:00:30,019 --> 00:00:36,020
Today, due to personal reasons, but I'm a hard worker and I'm smart.

9
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:40,020
I graduated top of my class at CalArts.

10
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,020
I understand the creative process.

11
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,020
And I'm not applying for a designer job here, am I?

12
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:52,020
Isn't it better for your assistant to be more keen on learning and catering to your needs

13
00:00:52,020 --> 00:01:00,170
as opposed to spending the day thinking about how to climb up the corporate ladder?

14
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:05,170
Unfortunately, wanting to be in the fashion world is a pre-work with it.

15
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:10,170
So, I am unable to extend you an offer today at this time, Miss.

16
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,170
McCartney, you can call me Nia.

17
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:14,969
Sure.

18
00:01:14,969 --> 00:01:16,969
Thank you for the opportunity.

19
00:01:16,969 --> 00:01:25,700
Yes. Wait, you drew this.

20
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:36,230
Today is your lucky day. You're hired.

21
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:40,650
Miss, wrinkly hoodie and dirty sneakers.
