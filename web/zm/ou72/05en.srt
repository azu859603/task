00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Miss wrinkled hoodie and dirty sneakers.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,160
You know, I should be happy that I got the job, but...

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,160
Condescending tongue really gets on my nerves.

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,160
I mean, he's not wrong though.

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,800
Well, still.

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,800
Plus, you could take one look at him and you know he's a playboy,

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,800
that he sleeps with random women on a daily basis.

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,800
You know, you shouldn't talk about his private life.

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,800
He's our boss after all.

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,800
Yeah, I should probably tell you something.

11
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,800
I have a boyfriend now.

12
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,800
What?

13
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,799
When?

14
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:37,799
And most importantly, who is the unbelievably lucky bastard?

15
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:39,799
You don't know him.

16
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:42,799
But you're gonna introduce him to me in Qatar, right?

17
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:44,020
Hello.

18
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:45,020
Be at that.

19
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:47,469
Of course.

20
00:00:47,469 --> 00:01:03,320
Mr. Lynn.

21
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,319
My presume.

22
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,829
Been sent here to pick you up on a date.

23
00:01:07,829 --> 00:01:11,250
I was unaware of this, but sure.

24
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:15,700
Kind of boyfriend you got there, the Prince of England.

25
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:24,420
Where are we going?

26
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:35,980
What's wrong?

27
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:37,980
We didn't see him this last night.

28
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:39,170
I...

29
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:42,700
I'll just...

30
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:46,599
I'm sorry, I'm just a little clumsy.

31
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:48,599
Look, she's looking for you.
