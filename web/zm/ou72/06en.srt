1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,980
Why don't you see what he looks like?

2
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:06,980
Is he handsome?

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:07,980
Yeah he is.

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,980
Next time I'll choose him to become.

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:11,980
Just to sneak.

6
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:12,980
Yay!

7
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:13,980
Yay!

8
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,980
I just started dating him again.

9
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:17,980
He's not the most beautiful person, so...

10
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:18,980
Next time...

11
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:19,980
Talk soon.

12
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,980
Which guy did that woman?

13
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,050
Got it.

14
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:26,050
Why are they always the same?

15
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:28,050
Go.

16
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:30,050
I...

17
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:32,049
Enjoy your day.

18
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:33,049
That's it.

19
00:00:33,049 --> 00:00:34,460
Good for you.

20
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:36,460
For securing your financial future.

21
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:40,460
While the rest of us still have to work.

22
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:47,549
So you're two of friends?

23
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:50,579
Yeah, is that a problem?

24
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:51,579
No, it's...

25
00:00:51,579 --> 00:00:55,189
Just both of you wear the same perfume.
