1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,860
Yeah, we both tend to like the same things.

2
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:11,099
Nia, to dreams coming true.

3
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:13,099
To jobs that pay the rent.

4
00:00:13,099 --> 00:00:14,099
Yeah, okay.

5
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:16,100
I wish you could have been there.

6
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,100
And the girls that work there,

7
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:20,100
they're all saline.

8
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,100
So beautiful, so fashionable.

9
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,100
You know, I'm not the insecure type,

10
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:29,100
but it made me feel really so conscious.

11
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,100
What are you talking about?

12
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:33,100
You are so beautiful, and you are fashionable,

13
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,100
and above all else, you are talented.

14
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:39,100
I mean, Nia means purpose, right?

15
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,100
And like you said, it's a job that pays the rent.

16
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:45,100
So you finish my graphic novel at night.

17
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,100
Yeah.

18
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:49,100
I always need you in my corner.

19
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,679
You're not unique.

20
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:53,679
Mr. Holzer, I thought you already found a girl

21
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:54,679
you might hear the other night.

22
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:55,679
I did.

23
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:56,679
Something just doesn't feel right.

24
00:00:56,679 --> 00:00:58,679
I can't put my finger on it.

25
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:02,130
That's the new assistant you just hired.

26
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:06,439
It looks like we're not making the job demanding enough for her.

27
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:10,439
We got time for doodles and dates with our boyfriend.

28
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:26,239
Where is the pitch deck that I asked you to prepare?

29
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:28,590
I'm supposed to have advice.

30
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,590
Good evening, Mr. Holzer.

31
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:34,590
To be fair, you said you wanted it to be finished soon.

32
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:38,590
If you change your mind, I could go back to the office

33
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:42,829
and finish it tonight.

34
00:01:42,829 --> 00:01:44,829
No, don't go to the office.

35
00:01:44,829 --> 00:01:46,180
Go to my house.
