1
00:00:04,429 --> 00:00:07,490
No, I...

2
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:11,490
This couch was a gift from somebody very important to me.

3
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:14,490
I'm very sorry.

4
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:16,129
Get out.

5
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:17,800
What?

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,800
You bumped into me. It was my sharpie, but it wasn't my fault.

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:32,729
Get out before I make you get out.

8
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:36,729
Let's make it chic, but tasteful to echo our new line.

9
00:00:36,729 --> 00:00:38,729
And I think the themes can be black and white.

10
00:00:38,729 --> 00:00:43,109
Black and white meet and greet party for peak capital.

11
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:45,299
Cut it.

12
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:48,909
We can decorate the space and totally make it chic.

13
00:00:48,909 --> 00:00:49,909
When do you want to do it?

14
00:00:49,909 --> 00:00:50,909
Tomorrow.

15
00:00:50,909 --> 00:00:57,539
Tomorrow? That's... I'll get right on it.

16
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:01,100
No, I prefer to do it.

17
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:12,060
And leave that blank.
