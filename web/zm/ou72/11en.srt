1
00:00:01,139 --> 00:00:12,919
Don't mess it up by dressing like an idiot. Again. How about this one?

2
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:18,589
No, it's too formal. I mean, you're not going to funeral, right?

3
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:26,989
No, it's too casual. I mean, it wouldn't even let you down a tennis court right now, huh?

4
00:00:26,989 --> 00:00:29,629
You really don't know how to dress for the occasion, do you?

5
00:00:30,309 --> 00:00:32,399
Hey, I'm just...

6
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:38,770
I want you to see this new fashion scene. I know. I know. Hey, look. Hey. Yeah

7
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:41,210
There we go. Oh

8
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:48,369
Well, it's a good thing that you've got like a natural eye for the beauty and photography and

9
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:53,490
literature, so you shouldn't think of fashion as this isolated island of a thing, right?

10
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:59,250
All art forms are connected and plus you look beautiful in everything

11
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:28,510
everything

12
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:35,319
Where's your ugly little friend who embarrassed by her pathetic style to show up?

13
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:41,439
I mean, this isn't really her scene, but she's trying. So I have to try a lot harder than she has.

14
00:01:41,920 --> 00:02:08,939
Anyone want a cupcake?

15
00:02:08,939 --> 00:02:14,500
James, is this part of your line? I love it. It's so modern-day Audrey had burned.

16
00:02:14,699 --> 00:02:22,419
My daughters would wear the hell out of that and the model shall he say is dropped at gorgeous, too.

17
00:02:22,419 --> 00:02:25,319
Oh, it is. It's not.

18
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,759
Mr. Brohem, this is merely one of the ideas Mr. Holzer is testing out.

19
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:34,919
If you already like this one, your mind will be blown by the rest of the collection. I

20
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:39,280
can see the seams on your dress. Did you make it yourself? I didn't know that you could sew.

21
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:59,650
Dumb beginner's luck. Did you change into a...

22
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:14,430
Let's go to the bathroom. It's gonna be okay. Look, let me just... I don't need you to come to my rescue.

23
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:29,870
I can do it myself. It is something wrong, Sleen. I'm sorry. It's just that I totally embarrassed myself and you. You just...

24
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:33,469
You don't even care about fashion. You didn't study it,

25
00:03:33,909 --> 00:03:42,020
but you somehow pull off a modern-day retro scheme out of nowhere. I had help. Cut her healthy. Of course you did.

26
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:46,259
And of course

27
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:48,500
you're just always good at whatever you do.

28
00:03:49,099 --> 00:03:56,860
I'm regretting recommending you to work here. I might just be lucky.

29
00:04:00,099 --> 00:04:01,879
Somehow just...

30
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:05,909
worked. I don't even know what I'm doing.

31
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:17,069
That's not true. I know you work hard and you have killer instincts.

32
00:04:20,629 --> 00:04:29,990
I'm sorry, okay? Like you totally deserve a thumbs up tonight. And goddamn, you really do look like a modern-day art recap.

33
00:04:31,189 --> 00:04:33,189
How?

34
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:53,339
Let me help you.

35
00:04:53,339 --> 00:04:55,339
Yeah.

36
00:05:12,589 --> 00:05:15,170
I try.

37
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:23,000
Sometimes. Why is my heart beating out of my chest? Did I see it right? He thought that electric jolt, too.

38
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:31,319
I really didn't have to do all the streams.

39
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:36,290
Although I haven't been made. I've always wanted to come here. Of course.

40
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:49,250
Happy birthday, Sleen. Is that a new perfume that I smell?

41
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:54,980
Smells different than the last one.

42
00:05:54,980 --> 00:06:02,259
Yeah. Yeah, I recently switched brands. Look, the old one. Me too.

43
00:06:02,259 --> 00:06:05,540
I just ran out of my last one, but I'm gonna stop.

44
00:06:06,019 --> 00:06:11,259
Sleen, you don't have to be so formal with me. We're not at work. We're all alone.

45
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:21,800
Where's that carefree girl that I met? Out of miss her. May I have one? Like, oh,

46
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:26,709
actually, I guess we'll have a bottle. We can handle it, right?

47
00:06:30,709 --> 00:06:32,709
Yeah.

48
00:06:32,709 --> 00:06:38,550
Long day, huh?

49
00:06:39,269 --> 00:06:41,750
I mean, do you think Celine's coming home with a boyfriend though?

50
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:46,899
Like, who is that guy? If she tells you everything, why didn't she tell you about that?

51
00:06:46,899 --> 00:06:50,339
I know, right? I just hope he's good to her.

52
00:06:51,399 --> 00:07:00,970
Otherwise, he'll have me to answer too. I wouldn't even be here if it weren't for Celine.

53
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:18,790
I just want to say thanks, Celine, for organizing this awesome party.

54
00:07:19,819 --> 00:07:21,819
You guys are the best present I could ask for.

55
00:07:23,269 --> 00:07:26,100
Cheers.

56
00:07:27,459 --> 00:07:29,699
Now, what do you want to do, birthday girl?

57
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Oh, yeah. There it is.

58
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:46,009
Before we join them, can I talk to you first now?

59
00:07:48,069 --> 00:07:53,110
Cutter, I've been thinking about this a lot and I want to tell you about it.

60
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:58,620
It's Nia's birthday. I don't know how to keep her waiting, right?

61
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:44,600
You okay? You went a little too wild there, birthday girl? You saved my life.

62
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:50,460
Shit. I'm going to have to repay you for your birthday next month.

63
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:54,620
You have energy to choke. You're okay.

64
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:19,379
Let's.

65
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:22,899
Whoa, okay.

66
00:09:22,899 --> 00:09:29,960
Let's, we'll show you, you met.

67
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:37,269
Oh, okay.

68
00:09:37,269 --> 00:09:38,299
Oh, hi.

69
00:09:38,299 --> 00:09:38,940
Hi.

70
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:41,659
We should go.

71
00:09:41,659 --> 00:09:43,019
Uh, check, please, let's go.

72
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:45,639
Let's wait, let's wait, let's go.

73
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:46,279
Okay.

74
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:47,559
Um, why don't you just take a seat?

75
00:09:49,019 --> 00:10:05,980
Whoa, what, what, then you should take some rest.

76
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,820
I'm going to, I'm going to take a shot.

77
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:25,639
Here we go, shopping tomorrow and having a catch.

78
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:33,080
No, that spot is actually growing on me.

79
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:56,659
Out of here, before I kick you out.

80
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:02,330
God, Cutter, it's you, I'm so sorry.

81
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:05,769
It was just my reflexes. Why were you so close to me?

82
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,940
I was getting someone on your face, but I mean,

83
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,019
like, who did you think I was, like, out of James?

84
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:18,009
I'm sorry, Celine.

85
00:11:18,649 --> 00:11:20,330
I feel really tired all of a sudden.

86
00:11:21,129 --> 00:11:22,730
Maybe you should go home tonight,

87
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:25,529
and I want to make clear about one thing again.

88
00:11:25,529 --> 00:11:27,690
We're still trying this thing out, okay?

89
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:29,669
Yes, of course.

90
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:32,230
I'm keeping it casual too.

91
00:11:32,789 --> 00:11:34,230
No labels, just fine.

92
00:11:35,909 --> 00:11:38,490
Good. Good night, Celine.

93
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:41,820
What did you think I was, like,

94
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:42,620
James?

95
00:11:43,419 --> 00:11:44,379
Of course not.

96
00:11:45,259 --> 00:11:46,860
Why would I think about James?

97
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:49,340
Because he's, like, all you ever talk about,

98
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,100
and, I mean, he's clearly into you.

99
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:52,220
What?

100
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:57,399
No, I know, he's campy.

101
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,259
Is he?

102
00:12:01,259 --> 00:12:01,500
Great.

103
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,740
Next urgent situation.

104
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:06,220
Roxy had to drop out of the promo shoot with you today.

105
00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:08,139
Her agent let me know this morning,

106
00:12:08,139 --> 00:12:09,899
because her bill talks went all over.

107
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,700
Do we push it or?

108
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,220
No, no, we can't push it.

109
00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:16,779
We have to get the sum for P Capital.

110
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,860
Is there anybody else that we can reach out to?

111
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:21,129
It's a simple modeling job.

112
00:12:21,129 --> 00:12:22,649
The footage will be edited anyway.

113
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:25,529
Maybe we can get one of the girls from the office to do it.

114
00:12:26,169 --> 00:12:27,289
How about Celine?

115
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:28,889
You're slender and pretty.

116
00:12:29,529 --> 00:12:31,929
Yeah, that would be a great choice.

117
00:12:31,929 --> 00:12:33,690
I remember one of our photographers

118
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:36,009
mistook her farm model on set once.

119
00:12:36,009 --> 00:12:37,049
That's right, I was there.

120
00:12:38,899 --> 00:12:40,179
Okay, do you think you can do it?

121
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,460
I think so.

122
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,740
You think so.

123
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,620
Okay, we have no time.

124
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,779
Can you please stand up so we can see if the outfits

125
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:50,539
will fit you like Roxy's body.

126
00:12:51,659 --> 00:12:52,220
Do a spin?

127
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,940
Oh, excuse me, hey, hi.

128
00:12:58,940 --> 00:12:59,659
Yes, you?

129
00:12:59,659 --> 00:13:00,940
If you could please come in here, please.

130
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:01,340
Thank you.

131
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,289
Jocelyn, let's have her do it.

132
00:13:03,289 --> 00:13:05,129
Mr. Broyam likes her already.

133
00:13:05,129 --> 00:13:08,169
And as I can see, her waist is a little bit smaller.

134
00:13:09,259 --> 00:13:11,100
Yeah, that'll fit better.

135
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,019
Okay, Celine, you're going to assist on the shoot.

136
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:13,980
Thank you for the spin.

137
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:38,539
Are you all right?

138
00:13:38,539 --> 00:13:42,549
No, because she has a similar body tucked her up.

139
00:13:42,549 --> 00:13:43,590
I understand.

140
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:46,070
And I also don't want special treatment just because I'm here.

141
00:13:46,389 --> 00:13:47,350
My what?

142
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:48,870
Celine, we've talked about this.

143
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:51,909
I know, but you know that I'm not the kind of girl

144
00:13:51,909 --> 00:13:54,149
that we took all night, like nothing.

145
00:13:54,149 --> 00:13:55,669
I'm not the irresponsible type.

146
00:13:56,230 --> 00:14:01,019
That's why I'm giving this us even a chance, aren't I?

147
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:05,779
I know, but hey Celine, the makeup people

148
00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:07,779
and the photographer can't decide

149
00:14:07,779 --> 00:14:09,700
on a good pair of earrings for you to wear.

150
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,299
Can I just borrow ears?

151
00:14:11,299 --> 00:14:12,740
You know, good smile.

152
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:13,220
Of course.

153
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:25,179
Mr. Holzer, you're here too.

154
00:14:26,549 --> 00:14:27,830
Did I interrupt something?

155
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:28,789
No, no.

156
00:14:30,389 --> 00:14:34,230
Cut two shots from the list and it goes to the time.

157
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:35,429
Yes.

158
00:14:35,429 --> 00:14:36,549
Got it, Mr. Holzer.

159
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:37,909
Come on.

160
00:14:37,909 --> 00:14:39,830
We have a very tight spatula balloon.

161
00:14:44,309 --> 00:14:47,590
Can we have the female model in her first alpha taker

162
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:54,379
position so we can test the light air in outfit, please?

163
00:14:57,210 --> 00:15:03,049
Yeah, come here, just do this.

164
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,929
This is so crazy.

165
00:15:05,929 --> 00:15:08,330
Can you imagine me, a model?

166
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:09,850
Go, go, go, go, talk after.

167
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:41,539
I just like that.

168
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:44,019
That's how it looks straight out.

169
00:15:44,019 --> 00:15:45,379
My friend has underwear.

170
00:15:46,259 --> 00:15:47,860
Well, I know we were going for provocative,

171
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,539
but I didn't think we were going this far.

172
00:15:50,179 --> 00:16:09,100
I think this is my work, don't you think?

173
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,220
Absolutely smashing.

174
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,019
March is gorgeous.

175
00:16:11,019 --> 00:16:11,659
Okay.

176
00:16:11,659 --> 00:16:14,139
How about you strike a few poses for me?

177
00:16:15,299 --> 00:16:16,259
Stunning.

178
00:16:16,259 --> 00:16:16,899
Perfect.

179
00:16:16,899 --> 00:16:18,340
I love that pose.

180
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,700
Perfect shot.

181
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,779
And James, she is such a natural.

182
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,460
Truly something fast.

183
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:24,659
Smile.

184
00:16:24,659 --> 00:16:27,399
There we go.

185
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:28,360
Perfect.

186
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,240
I loved it.

187
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,279
Loving it.

188
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:52,940
How about James?

189
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,460
How about you join her?

190
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:57,500
This is just a one sequence,

191
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,980
and I'm looking for an old,

192
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:03,259
tiny, singing on a rain style dance.

193
00:17:03,259 --> 00:17:05,259
It smiles and all, please, please.

194
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:07,180
Sorry.

195
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:07,740
No, no, no.

196
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:08,460
No, that was great.

197
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,099
Don't be sorry.

198
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:10,779
Just keep it going, keep it going.

199
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:11,980
Perfect, yes.

200
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:12,940
I love this.

201
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:13,819
Loving it.

202
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:14,940
Crash into each other.

203
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:17,180
I love that, yeah.

204
00:17:18,259 --> 00:17:18,740
Okay.

205
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:23,059
How about one more final spin,

206
00:17:23,059 --> 00:17:25,940
and then let's end on a classic pose.

207
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:28,019
You grab her by the waist, James.

208
00:17:28,019 --> 00:17:30,019
You lean back near.

209
00:17:30,019 --> 00:17:30,740
I'm loving this.

210
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:31,619
I'm loving this.

211
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:34,329
I really love that shot.

212
00:17:34,329 --> 00:17:34,970
And cut.

213
00:17:36,279 --> 00:17:36,680
Perfect.

214
00:17:41,049 --> 00:17:42,089
So you do dance.

215
00:17:42,809 --> 00:17:45,210
Do you also wear the same perfume as silly?

216
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:48,970
What?

217
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:55,130
Oh, that one was H-O-T.

218
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:58,380
Oh god, I could feel the electricity through the screen.

219
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:01,180
Now, you two aren't really dating each other in real life.

220
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:04,339
No, not because I don't want to.

221
00:18:05,509 --> 00:18:05,990
Wait, wait.

222
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:07,670
I'm not saying I don't want to date him either.

223
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,180
Can we just get back to work?

224
00:18:10,819 --> 00:18:12,900
Is there really nothing going on between the two of you?

225
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:16,140
Oh, did I just strike a nerve?

226
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:16,380
No.

227
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:20,059
Why don't we just go ahead with the second look?

228
00:18:20,059 --> 00:18:21,099
Okay, let's get back to work.

229
00:18:21,099 --> 00:18:21,980
Everyone back to work.

230
00:18:22,539 --> 00:18:33,670
If we feel in a way to replace her placement, there's a way.

231
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,880
I know this wrinkled hoodie and dirty sneakers

232
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:43,319
is becoming a favorite of his bit too quickly.

233
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:44,759
Don't you think?

234
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,119
You know, she's supposed to be her friend in all of it.

235
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:49,880
All of Santa do is get ahead of you.

236
00:18:56,569 --> 00:18:59,049
Yeah, you're supposed to be my friend.

237
00:18:59,049 --> 00:19:00,650
Why do you keep stepping on me?

238
00:19:01,369 --> 00:19:29,980
Let's get along with her, Jim.

239
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:32,279
I did.

240
00:19:32,359 --> 00:19:36,980
Have you lit?

241
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:53,240
Now, give me a little jump, both of you.

242
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,759
Can I get an help, please?

243
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:55,480
Hey.

244
00:19:55,480 --> 00:20:10,660
Okay.

245
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:13,460
Salim, what happened?

246
00:20:14,019 --> 00:20:16,420
You fell down when you weren't set.

247
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:19,799
I'm sorry.

248
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,059
Did I ruin the shoe?

249
00:20:22,059 --> 00:20:23,900
No, that's what you're worried about right now?

250
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,940
Well, yeah, it's very important to you, isn't it?

251
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,140
Well, don't worry about the shoe.

252
00:20:28,839 --> 00:20:30,519
Okay, you got hurt pretty badly.

253
00:20:30,519 --> 00:20:35,000
You suffered a mild electric shock and you have a concussion.

254
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,309
Right, look, look, I...

255
00:20:40,309 --> 00:20:41,990
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, take it easy.

256
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:43,880
Here it is.

257
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,720
I'm just a little dizzy and I'm okay.

258
00:20:50,819 --> 00:20:51,299
Salim.

259
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,579
Thank you, Mr. Hoser.

260
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:11,430
Look, you can call me James and don't thank me.

261
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,980
You just need to be less clumsy.

262
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,339
You can't be getting hurt.

263
00:21:15,339 --> 00:21:16,220
You are very hurt.

264
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,140
I am what?

265
00:21:19,859 --> 00:21:23,980
You're the face of the new collection and I'm going to need you more.

266
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,039
And there have been two instances where your instincts have proven pretty good.

267
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:35,480
The Audrey Hepburn outfit, the sash that you wore today.

268
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:41,539
So, I'll be promoting you on the design and editorial side of things.

269
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:49,380
I know that you never wanted to be in fashion and that you wanted to write your own graphic novel.

270
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:50,579
Right?

271
00:21:50,579 --> 00:21:52,099
All this promotion will help you...

272
00:21:52,980 --> 00:22:14,490
I'm going to let you cut and took a fall.

273
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:17,349
Is she alive? Where is she?

274
00:22:17,349 --> 00:22:18,470
She's inside.

275
00:22:19,269 --> 00:22:21,509
She's okay, I think.

276
00:22:24,059 --> 00:22:27,640
She just woke up but I fucked up, cut her.

277
00:22:28,759 --> 00:22:29,799
It's all my fault.

278
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:31,619
What does that mean?

279
00:22:32,259 --> 00:22:35,539
Did you have something to do with this?

280
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,099
Personally, it's being a fall.

281
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:42,900
Maybe she would twist your ankle and can't do the shoot anymore.

282
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:43,619
That's all.

283
00:22:43,619 --> 00:22:44,660
I didn't need to...

284
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:48,329
She's also a human boyfriend.

285
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56,579
You elected you and your best friend for a guy?

286
00:22:56,579 --> 00:22:58,900
I mean, that billionaire douchebag knows this.

287
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:22,779
It wasn't excellent.

288
00:23:22,779 --> 00:23:24,940
I just wanted to give her a small lesson,

289
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:27,579
especially since she's openly seducing my boyfriend.

290
00:23:29,269 --> 00:23:31,589
You rushed over here.

291
00:23:31,589 --> 00:23:33,029
All worried about her.

292
00:23:33,029 --> 00:23:34,470
You interrogate me,

293
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:36,950
writing on your freaking high moral horse.

294
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:40,869
You've always been in love with her but you're too chicken to tell her.

295
00:23:42,579 --> 00:23:43,299
Now look at you.

296
00:23:44,059 --> 00:23:48,059
You are finally where I was when I had a crush on you back in college.

297
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:49,819
The one not picked.

298
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:54,940
The one who stayed close with me just so you can get closer to Nia.

299
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:57,240
That's sweet, I'm sorry.

300
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,720
No, don't apologize now, okay?

301
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,240
I've moved on from you, cut her.

302
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:04,140
I'm glad now you know how it felt.

303
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,619
Because as long as there's Nia,

304
00:24:06,619 --> 00:24:13,079
I'll always be reminded that some people are just born the stars of this life thing.

305
00:24:14,059 --> 00:24:19,259
And you and me, somehow we're bound to be their supporting characters.

306
00:24:19,259 --> 00:24:23,980
Can you blame me for trying to come into the foreground in my life?

307
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,019
I still can't let you work.

308
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,680
Selena, I can't let you do that.

309
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:36,200
Please try.

310
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:43,019
Have we kissed before?

311
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:49,380
I've seen that you have your ear spirits but you never wear any earring.

312
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:12,759
Nia, should I file an occupational hazard lawsuit against Mr. Holzer?

313
00:25:12,759 --> 00:25:18,599
Because Selena just told me that it was an exposed wire that caused her fall on set.

314
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,960
No, Cutter, what are you talking about?

315
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,180
I trip, that's it.

316
00:25:25,369 --> 00:25:29,450
Exposed cable or not, you know me, I trip walking on flat ground.

317
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:31,369
I'm not going to sue him.

318
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:34,740
Fine, but Mr. Holzer, she gets her in your eyes.

319
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:35,140
You won't.

320
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:37,000
I'm going to sue you.

321
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:42,980
Um, this is Cutter, my very good friend since college.

322
00:25:43,619 --> 00:25:49,269
Cutter, James Holzer, you know, the boss.

323
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:55,210
She won't get hurt ever again, I can assure you.

324
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:58,890
Not on my watch and I will find out who's responsible if that exposed cable.

325
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:01,369
Okay, well you should go get on that then.

326
00:26:02,089 --> 00:26:05,130
Having you been away from your super important office long enough.

327
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:13,589
Joss, yes, what is it?

328
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:23,210
So you knew this aggressive since our college team lost a Duke?

329
00:26:23,289 --> 00:26:29,480
Well, I was worried about you and I felt unfair for you.

330
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:34,150
I mean, you've done so much for that job and you're in the hospital.

331
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:38,380
You're instantly too really care about me so much.

332
00:26:39,819 --> 00:26:42,220
Trust me, I'm really fine.

333
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:50,359
I was actually having a lot of fun being a fashion model before you know this.

334
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:52,569
I saw you kissing.

335
00:26:55,829 --> 00:26:58,950
Wasn't accident, I went for his cheek and he turned.

336
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,630
Don't you remember that he has a girlfriend?

337
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:06,250
You're right, but it really wasn't accident.

338
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:09,750
Did you want to kiss him for real?

339
00:27:17,079 --> 00:27:18,599
I'm a really shitty person, aren't I?

340
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:21,900
No, we all make mistakes, don't we?

341
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:28,220
You're not a bad person, you could never be that.

342
00:27:30,259 --> 00:27:33,339
You're actually the most incredible person I know.

343
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:36,470
Yeah, I wanted to tell you to.

344
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:44,150
Looks like I forgot my water.

345
00:27:44,309 --> 00:28:04,069
Everybody knew that you had a reputation, a playboy, a heartbreaker and you might think

346
00:28:04,069 --> 00:28:07,829
that that's a good reputation to have but I can tell you right now that it is not.

347
00:28:09,319 --> 00:28:14,200
A good man stays true to the one that he loves and doesn't go around kissing other

348
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,079
people's girls when he already has a girlfriend.

349
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:20,339
