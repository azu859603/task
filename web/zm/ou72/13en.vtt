00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:09.580
I feel like an old sickly lady.

2
00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:15.580
Well, the last F in BFF is forever, isn't it?

3
00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.579
So when we're both old and sickly,

4
00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:22.579
we might end up talking here just like right now.

5
00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:28.539
Celine, I really didn't know you and James were dating.

6
00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:31.539
The kiss really was an accident.

7
00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:35.539
When did you guys start dating the night at the bar?

8
00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:39.500
I know accidents happen.

9
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.159
We don't have to talk about it.

10
00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:50.149
I know about James' history and his reputation.

11
00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:57.640
But Nia, will you promise me one thing though?

12
00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.640
Promise me you won't steal him from me.

13
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:22.260
He's everything I've always wanted.

14
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.579
Oh.

15
00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:26.579
People actually like me here?

16
00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:27.579
Apparently.

17
00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:30.920
Welcome back.

18
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.920
There's no one else I'd rather see.

19
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.049
Could it be a cutter?

20
00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.459
Nia, can you come here, boys?
