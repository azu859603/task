00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.020
Nia, can you come here, please?

2
00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:04.019
Quick announcement.

3
00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:08.259
Nia is the newest junior designer.

4
00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:10.259
Congratulations, Nia!

5
00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:12.839
Well deserved.

6
00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:13.839
Thank you.

7
00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:14.839
My house.

8
00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:20.710
Sush is back now.

9
00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.100
Stronger than ever.

10
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.829
How long did it take you to get that position?

11
00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:27.829
Five years?

12
00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:28.899
Took her what?

13
00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:31.059
Five weeks?

14
00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:33.310
Oh, you gave up.

15
00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.560
Oh, the BFF team is back in action now, huh?

16
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:43.759
Of course, part is you didn't want any of this.

17
00:00:43.759 --> 00:00:45.759
So what are you going to do about it now?

18
00:00:45.759 --> 00:01:13.340
Second dry desk, bulk sketchbooks.

19
00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.409
Thank you so much, Selene, your life saver.

20
00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.409
Yeah, of course, Nia.

21
00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:25.040
Anything for you?
