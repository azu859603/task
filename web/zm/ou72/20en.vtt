00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:23.059
This is a little last of them.

2
00:00:23.059 --> 00:00:27.399
It's Mr. Huggle-Buggled.

3
00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:28.660
Mr. Huggle-Buggled?

4
00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:42.619
Well, why don't you look into Mr. Huggle-Buggled's eyes?

5
00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:46.340
So besides Celine and Cutter, there's nobody else in your apartment.

6
00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.140
And no signs of intrusion.

7
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.329
None that we could spot in any way.

8
00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.100
The good thing is the cameras that we have are brand new once they let the tag on it.

9
00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.259
And now that's a look to see if the person who brought the cameras was careless enough

10
00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:02.259
to leave the behind.

11
00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:05.680
You sure you want to do that?

12
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.680
You're going to ruin your expensive suit?

13
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.680
No, it's not.

14
00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:09.680
No expense to me.

15
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:10.680
I bought them.

16
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:17.379
Cool.
