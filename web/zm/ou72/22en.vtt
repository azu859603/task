00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.429
what did you do it James what do you mean I have no idea what you're talking

2
00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:23.379
about you can drop the act look I know that we had a fun night we said that we

3
00:00:23.379 --> 00:00:28.379
were gonna give this a try but I never said that we were and when Nia got hurt

4
00:00:28.379 --> 00:00:32.340
I let you mislead her because I didn't want to come in with two new girls but

5
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:39.340
then you went ahead and do that to your best friend did you tell her no I

6
00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:46.649
haven't because I'm like you I don't want to hurt her but I should tell her

7
00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:59.000
should you absolutely should but you're right she will feel so hurt she found out

8
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:07.680
it was me sure you want to do that and drop the good guy at you slept with me

9
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.280
you pretended you wanted a relationship with me just so that it wouldn't confirm

10
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:18.000
that you are exactly the floozy clay boy the tabloids made you out to be be

11
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.450
flirted with Nia every chance you got you want her I have eyes everyone in the

12
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:33.079
office can see it so don't try to lecture me I just realized something I just

13
00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:38.560
realized like this is the real yeah and that's soft-spoken reserved and hard

14
00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:49.230
to work in Selena wasn't you you're not Nia's friend and you don't

15
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:54.510
deserve to be your friend you know why because you're jealous small and desperate

16
00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:02.379
and you're right I do want her not you they don't never be because she's

17
00:02:02.379 --> 00:02:06.409

18
00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:12.180
