00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,759
Send out a memo, I'm slowing down and no longer works here.

2
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:31,570
Hey, just wanted to come by and check on you,

3
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:37,049
and also to let you know that only Fansgate has been taken care of.

4
00:00:37,049 --> 00:00:42,780
You were here.

5
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,780
Yeah, of course I'm here. I'm a friend.

6
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,159
What do you do a year on her day off?

7
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:51,159
Boss, man.

8
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:55,859
I'm feeling much better already.

9
00:00:55,859 --> 00:00:59,659
Thank you both for checking in on me.

10
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:04,659
Weird though, I haven't heard from Celine. Is she working late?

11
00:01:04,659 --> 00:01:08,560
The collection is starting up very soon.

12
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,560
The one that you're the face of.

13
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,560
And if you were up to it, there were a few things on the event plan

14
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,560
that I'd like your input on.

15
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,780
Right now?

16
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:19,780
No. Are you kidding me?

17
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:22,780
Nia, you don't have to go with them.

18
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:26,730
Do you want to go with them?

19
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:31,560
Maybe it will help me get my mind off things.

20
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:48,930
Oh, Nia, I hope you know that.

21
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:52,540
I'll always be there to protect you.

22
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:53,540
Always.

23
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:58,730
No matter if it's stalkers, creams, whatever they're writing,

24
00:01:58,730 --> 00:01:59,730
I'll always be there.

25
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:02,760
What other varieties are there?
