00:00:04,179 --> 00:00:11,429
You said the couch was a gift from someone important. Who was it? My mom

2
00:00:14,939 --> 00:00:16,940
Apologize to her from me

3
00:00:17,579 --> 00:00:24,140
She's passed away. She died while I was working. Oh

4
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:28,769
God, I am so so sorry

5
00:00:29,489 --> 00:00:34,880
I really messed up big time didn't I?

6
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:40,179
For what it's worth I

7
00:00:40,179 --> 00:00:41,729
I

8
00:00:41,729 --> 00:00:45,049
Lost my mom in high school. Celine helped me through those

9
00:00:45,789 --> 00:00:48,679
dark dark days

10
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:50,509
Nadine

11
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:51,770
about

12
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:53,770
Celine and up. I

13
00:00:54,170 --> 00:01:00,450
Was doing research on how to clean the marks off of sheepskin. They might not work, but it's fine

14
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:09,540
You can keep the dirty spot. I kind of like it that way. It reminds me of you
