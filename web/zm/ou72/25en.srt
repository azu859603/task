00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:09,439
You're Celine's boyfriend. We we can't we we shouldn't Celine and I are not in a relationship

2
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:13,359
I mean we we only went out on two dates. That's it

3
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:20,140
But Celine seems to really like him though. I I don't know what's going on between you two

4
00:00:21,859 --> 00:00:24,559
relationship or not what matters to me is

5
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:28,039
She likes you for real

6
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:30,839
And I promised her I'd stay away from you. So

7
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:37,619
Let's just keep things strictly professional. Okay, so you're not gonna hear my side of the story

8
00:00:38,259 --> 00:00:42,689
That's fine and just

9
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:49,460
Do work

10
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:55,100
Jocelyn booked Tropicana for next week. It's it's party. It's nothing high-end, but because it has the outdoor pool

11
00:00:55,659 --> 00:00:56,960
it

12
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,990
matches the energy of the collection

13
00:01:01,429 --> 00:01:03,429
Okay, James focus on work

14
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:07,430
It's a very delicate and complicated situation with Celine

15
00:01:08,269 --> 00:01:10,269
Find another time to explain it to her

16
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:15,040
She smells so good. She's wearing that perfume again

17
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,739
He's so easy so easy so easy

18
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:23,959
Yeah, get it together. You're here to work
