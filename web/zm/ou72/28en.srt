1
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:03,620
I need to tell her.

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:04,620
No, you don't.

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,450
What happened to you?

4
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:10,449
You love this James dude so much that you'd be willing to do anything?

5
00:00:10,449 --> 00:00:13,740
I don't even recognize you anymore.

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,019
Yes.

7
00:00:15,019 --> 00:00:17,059
I want to be with Nia.

8
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:20,379
But I would never, ever stoop this low.

9
00:00:20,379 --> 00:00:22,379
Now let go of me.

10
00:00:22,379 --> 00:00:43,939
Why are you rejecting me?

11
00:00:43,939 --> 00:00:45,939
Please don't tell me it's because of Celine.

12
00:00:45,939 --> 00:00:51,219
Look, I don't know how to make it more abundantly clear that I don't want her.

13
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:55,289
Look, when you were in the hospital, I didn't have a chance to explain things

14
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:58,289
and I didn't want to sound like I was coming in between the girls.

15
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:02,289
But Nia, you have to believe me that all I want.
