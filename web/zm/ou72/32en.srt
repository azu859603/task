1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:04,059
Did you find her?

2
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:07,209
No.

3
00:00:07,209 --> 00:00:10,339
It's like she disappeared off the face of the earth.

4
00:00:10,339 --> 00:00:12,339
She won't return any of my calls.

5
00:00:12,339 --> 00:00:16,339
James fired her so she won't be at work anymore.

6
00:00:16,339 --> 00:00:22,339
I'm in such a conflicted state because she broke my fucking heart.

7
00:00:22,339 --> 00:00:29,190
Yet at the same time, my heart is full because I'm with James.

8
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:31,989
Celine braided me too.

9
00:00:31,989 --> 00:00:33,990
For being a coward.

10
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:38,820
For not telling you how I actually felt about you.

11
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,820
But truthfully, I think you've always known me.

12
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,509
You want to stay friends?

13
00:00:45,509 --> 00:00:48,060
You don't want things to get awkward.

14
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:50,979
And you know, I want the same.

15
00:00:50,979 --> 00:00:52,979
So no more awkwardness.

16
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:56,210
You know, no more one-sided feelings.

17
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:59,210
At least I'll try to stop them from now on.

18
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:02,520
Come on, come on.

19
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,030
A big hug for an old friend.

20
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:09,219
That way we don't have to talk about this anymore.

21
00:01:09,219 --> 00:01:11,219
I mean, God, that was painful.

22
00:01:11,219 --> 00:01:20,299
I do love you, Patrick.

23
00:01:20,299 --> 00:01:29,599
Oh, hey.

24
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:30,599
Hey.

25
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:31,599
Hey.

26
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:33,689
You okay?

27
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:35,780
What's going on?

28
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:40,459
Oh, we should go.

29
00:01:40,459 --> 00:01:41,459
Let's go.

30
00:01:41,459 --> 00:01:47,040
Yeah.

31
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,040
Positive.

32
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,620
I'm pregnant.

33
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,620
Oh, my God.

34
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,680
Oh, there's my way.

35
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,739
Oh, my God.

36
00:01:55,739 --> 00:01:56,739
Oh, my God.
