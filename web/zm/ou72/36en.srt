1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,100
My baby with Jane.

2
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:33,799
Then again, you guys were even out.

3
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:36,960
I came to say, this is by all that's happened.

4
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,789
You were my best friend in the whole world.

5
00:00:40,789 --> 00:00:43,509
You helped me through so much.

6
00:00:43,509 --> 00:00:46,770
You were always there for me.

7
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:50,590
And because I had you, I was too happy to.

8
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:54,429
And over my head, I never noticed how you felt.

9
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:56,990
I overlooked you feelings more than once.

10
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,859
I wasn't the best friend you deserved.

11
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:01,979
And for that, I was worried.

12
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:07,340
You shouldn't apologize to me and for what I should have done.

13
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:11,060
But for as bad of a friend as I was,

14
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:13,780
I still didn't deserve the way you treated me.

15
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:15,980
You almost electrocuted me.

16
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,540
You creeped on me.

17
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:18,379
You poisoned me.

18
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:19,540
You tried to defame me.

19
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:23,219
You pretended to be me.

20
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:38,129
I don't think I'll ever be able to forgive you.

21
00:01:38,129 --> 00:01:42,170
And James in a plated boss kind of way.

22
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:52,430
It might not have been for love, but it was love.

23
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:55,719
And that's all I came here to say.

24
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:58,469
Goodbye, sleep.

25
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:04,780
Have a good one.

26
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:10,680
Yeah.

27
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,680
No.

28
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:18,680
I'm in my soul favorite.
