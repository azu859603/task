00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:09.980
Are you okay?

2
00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.660
I'm done with the past.

3
00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.559
It's time to move forward.

4
00:00:17.559 --> 00:00:19.559
Fully and completely.

5
00:00:19.559 --> 00:00:23.519
And a future with me.

6
00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.519
You still want that?

7
00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:27.519
Well, that's up to you, isn't it?

8
00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:31.129
You'd have to keep me interested.

9
00:00:31.129 --> 00:00:33.420
Challenge accepted.

10
00:00:33.420 --> 00:01:05.180
Ready to go?

11
00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.180
Thanks.

12
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.430
Thank you.

13
00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.430
I really like your book.

14
00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.430
You look so good for it.

15
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.840
Yeah, absolutely.

16
00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:17.840
Thank you.

17
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.840
You look so pretty.

18
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:27.409
I loved your book.

19
00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:28.409
Thank you.

20
00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.409
It's so sweet and gut-wrenching at the same time.

21
00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:38.659
What inspired the story?

22
00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:40.659
It was based on a real life mistake.

23
00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:43.819
The best mistake ever.
