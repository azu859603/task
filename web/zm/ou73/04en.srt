1
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:10,580
getting knocked up out of footlock, and you don't even know who the father is, do you?

2
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:11,580
I...

3
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:13,580
I don't know.

4
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:14,580
Really, you don't know?

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:20,579
No, the Walton family will not allow tramps like you to undermine our family.

6
00:00:20,579 --> 00:00:22,579
You pack up your things and leave.

7
00:00:22,579 --> 00:00:28,510
Wait.

8
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:32,509
Before you go, I need to make sure you haven't taken anything that's not yours.

9
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:35,509
After all, you were never Walton in the first place.

10
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:43,159
I knew you still had feelings for Alex.

11
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:46,159
Bitch, stay away from my fiance!

12
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:59,700
If I want to raise this child, there's no way I can stay in school.

13
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:05,349
Maybe it's time to get a job and prepare for my new life.

14
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,060
This is definitely the school.

15
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,250
Have you checked all the records?

16
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:18,250
Yes, but we don't have enough information to narrow it down.

17
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:22,390
She's gotta be here somewhere.
