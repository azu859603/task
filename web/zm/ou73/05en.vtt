00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160
Careful, Ms.

2
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:21.440
Come on, Samuel. I'm not going to find her like this. Let's go.

3
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:45.500
Seven years later, and I'm back again.

4
00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:49.909
Mommy, is this the place you met Daddy at?

5
00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:53.710
No, sweetie. Mommy's just here for work.

6
00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.710
Now be a good boy and wait in the lobby until I'm done, okay?

7
00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:57.710
Okay.

8
00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:40.299
Have the dress for the client? Do you know where she is?

9
00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:42.430
The woman in the green dress?

10
00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.530
Okay, thank you.

11
00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.859
Tofia?

12
00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:56.650
Here is your dress for tonight, man.

13
00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.980
Huge fan of your own.

14
00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:08.229
You're finally here to forever.

15
00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.229
Didn't I say to put it in a garment bag?

16
00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.229
This looks filthy on my book where it is.

17
00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:14.229
I'm terribly sorry.
