00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.059
Oh my... Emily!

2
00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:06.259
What are you doing at the college reunion ball?

3
00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:08.759
You didn't even graduate. You can leave now.

4
00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:10.160
What's going on?

5
00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.150
Alex, darling!

6
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.539
Um, LaCouche, what up?

7
00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:15.939
Emily?

8
00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:18.739
She was just here to deliver my clothes.

9
00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:20.339
It's been so long.

10
00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:23.179
Since you're here, why don't you stay for dinner?

11
00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:25.980
Um, if my Alex says to vial me and stay,

12
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.179
but the dinner is $200, do you think you can afford that?

13
00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:31.379
No, sorry, I can't.

14
00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:42.950
Oh, no, I can't take your money.

15
00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:51.060
Is everything all right, sir?

16
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.560
How much are you paying for the violinist today?

17
00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.759
Well, you can earn a few hundred bucks for one piece, if you're good.

18
00:00:57.759 --> 00:00:59.259
I'll do it for $200.

19
00:00:59.259 --> 00:01:09.349
Can I try?

20
00:01:09.349 --> 00:01:24.909
That's enough.

21
00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:27.810
You can't just make noise on a violin and call it music.

22
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.760
$200 for this?

23
00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:50.040
That's too easy.

24
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.439
Your grandmother has a point, Mr. Anderson.

25
00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.819
You can't keep sabotaging her love life for some dream girl from seven years ago.

26
00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:58.819
She's not coming back, even if she does exist.

27
00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:00.319
She's real, Samuel.

28
00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:02.540
She's got to be out there somewhere.

29
00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:18.400
She's got to be.

30
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.199
Folger people only like status, wealth, power, and influence.

31
00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:26.199
In their eyes, this is all that matters.
