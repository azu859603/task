00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,500
Thank you.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,500
Wow, you are incredible.

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:06,500
Thank you.

4
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:07,500
You deserve this.

5
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,500
Thanks, but I'll just... it's fine.

6
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:15,750
Piece of cake.

7
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:20,750
Well, since we're all such good college runs, let's make it to post.

8
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:24,750
My bad.

9
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:25,750
Oops.

10
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:31,750
Oh, oops. I guess I'm clumsy, too.

11
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:32,750
Oh, my bad.

12
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,750
Dude, you bitch!

13
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:37,750
Mr. Anderson.

14
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:42,479
This lady is my date.

15
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:45,119
What? Your date?

16
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:46,119
Samuel?

17
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:54,119
Regardless of whether or not this young lady is Mr. Anderson's date, you should consider your actions and how they reflect on both orders.

18
00:00:55,700 --> 00:01:00,700
Mr. Anderson, I'm sorry Sophia can't believe I'm from liquor.

19
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:08,810
He's excused to us.

20
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:12,540
Thank you for helping me out back there.

21
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,959
But I shouldn't be familiar.

22
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:26,250
Look, why does she look so familiar?

23
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,500
Why does he look so familiar?
