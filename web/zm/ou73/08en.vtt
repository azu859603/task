00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:09.380
It was just a misunderstanding.

2
00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:16.649
It's not a lie, it was a bit more than a... you're fine.

3
00:00:16.649 --> 00:00:21.219
Well, it looks like you need to start looking for a new job.

4
00:00:21.219 --> 00:00:24.219
Guys, it's time we start hiring new staff at the hotel.

5
00:00:24.219 --> 00:00:25.339
Come on.

6
00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:27.179
Greetings new hires.

7
00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:35.179
You have been offered the privilege of looking for the Anderson Imperial Hotel, managed by the illustrious Anderson family.

8
00:00:35.179 --> 00:00:41.179
Now we have guests coming in from all over the world, famous celebrities, wealthy entrepreneurs, and of course politicians.

9
00:00:41.179 --> 00:00:47.179
So keep your eyes, ears, and hands in check where they won't be consequences.

10
00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:49.179
Let's get back to work.

11
00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:52.179
We have jobs at the front desk, and we have cleaning jobs.

12
00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:55.179
Emily, you have an attractive looking face.

13
00:00:55.179 --> 00:00:57.179
I think we'll put you behind the front desk.

14
00:00:57.179 --> 00:01:03.179
Actually, sir, I just wanted to say that I worked at the front desk at my previous hotel job, so I believe I would be better suited there.

15
00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:06.180
And I think that Emily would be better at cleaning floors than I am.

16
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.180
Very well, probably we'll put you behind the front desk.

17
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:15.180
Emily, you'll be on the fourth floor cleaning corridor, and Susan, you can help her.

18
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.180
Now, chop chop, let's get to it.

19
00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:30.790
Anderson Imperial.

20
00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.019
Yes sir, in regards to the bidding, just a moment.

21
00:01:34.019 --> 00:01:38.069
Yes, about the Santa Monica Mall project.

22
00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:45.750
The offer coming from Mr. Anderson himself.

23
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.780
Excuse me, just... excuse me, let me call you back.

24
00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:51.780
You.

25
00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:52.780
I didn't hear anything.

26
00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.780
I'll see you then. Come with me.
