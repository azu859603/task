00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:04,540
Mr. Anderson, this young lady was eavesdropping on our offer.

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:09,400
Mr. Anderson, I'm really sorry. I was just passing by. I didn't mean to hear anything.

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,939
What? Samuel, how does this concern me?

4
00:00:11,939 --> 00:00:16,940
It's not a big project, but it's important. Technically she should be fired,

5
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:21,940
but I personally think that's way too harsh. Perhaps there's some kind of arrangement

6
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:23,940
that you could make.

7
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:28,940
I could sign something. A confidentiality agreement.

8
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:32,939
Please, I won't tell anyone. And if I break it, then you could punish me.

9
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:36,939
However you want, I need this job. Please don't fire me.

10
00:00:36,939 --> 00:00:41,570
Excuse me.

11
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:49,219
Do I look broke? Do you?

12
00:00:49,219 --> 00:00:53,219
No, no, that's not what I meant at all.
