1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
My dear boy, are you still working?

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,320
Oh my, this girl is lovely.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,400
What's your name?

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,119
Hello, madam, my name is Emily Wilson.

5
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:13,019
Oh, Wilson?

6
00:00:14,619 --> 00:00:17,100
That's had a good friend who was a Wilson.

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,179
How long have you been with my Henry?

8
00:00:19,179 --> 00:00:21,899
Oh, uh, Mr. Anderson and I aren't together.

9
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:24,980
Nana, why didn't you come here today?

10
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:27,940
Of course, I came to check if you're having lunch on time.

11
00:00:28,899 --> 00:00:31,460
Samuel told Mayor often too busy to eat.

12
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,420
That's why I keep telling you to hurry up and find a wife

13
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:38,929
who can help take care of you.

14
00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:42,579
Samuel is resistant after all.

15
00:00:42,579 --> 00:00:44,899
You can't bother him with everything.

16
00:00:46,259 --> 00:00:47,299
Unless Henry

17
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:50,979
tells me to like Samuel.

18
00:00:51,859 --> 00:00:52,740
You into men?

19
00:00:53,539 --> 00:00:55,539
Nana, it is not like that.

20
00:00:55,539 --> 00:00:57,539
Well, no matter what I think,

21
00:00:57,539 --> 00:00:59,060
you should be the best.

22
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,520
Emily and I are actually seeing each other.

23
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:05,299
Really?

24
00:01:06,939 --> 00:01:08,859
Help me with this and I will help you out with your job.

25
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,219
Yes, Mr. Anderson and I are actually dating.

26
00:01:15,819 --> 00:01:16,299
Perfect.

27
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,879
Weren't you always looking for that mystery girl all these years?

28
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:30,909
Be able to let her go.

29
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:33,230
That is different.

30
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:37,310
If I find her, I will make things right and take care of it.

31
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:38,269
Make up for what happened.

32
00:01:39,709 --> 00:01:41,310
At least what I think happened.

33
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,459
All right, all right.

34
00:01:43,459 --> 00:01:44,659
You're made up your mind.

35
00:01:45,379 --> 00:01:46,500
We'll bother you too.

36
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:49,379
Emily, next time come to my home.

37
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,439
So about my job?

38
00:01:59,379 --> 00:02:00,980
You know, I think I have a different job.

39
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:01,700
I mind for you.

40
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:03,950
I'm gonna drop a contract.

41
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:22,879
Bontract girlfriend?
