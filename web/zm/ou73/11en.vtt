1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
Take a look.

2
00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:08.140
As the girlfriend of party A during the term of this agreement, party B shall not engage

3
00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:15.759
in any physical contact or emotional intimacy with any other man, and shall have the responsibility

4
00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:21.559
and obligation to shield party A from unnecessary romantic entanglements.

5
00:00:21.559 --> 00:00:27.239
As compensation upon the expiration of the contract, a villa and two million dollars in

6
00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:30.760
cash will be provided.

7
00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:37.079
Mr. Anderson, with the terms of this contract, you could find anyone, one you.

8
00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:43.990
My grandmother actually likes to trust me if she didn't, she would make that move.

9
00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:51.979
Mr. Anderson, I really appreciate your kindness, but I can't accept something like that.

10
00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:56.579
Before you reject it, you have a problem with Sophia and Mr. Taylor, because if you agree

11
00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.659
to be my girlfriend, I can guarantee you that those two will never harass you again.

12
00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:19.049
When I propose two terms, one, no physical contact would benefit both parties, and two,

13
00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.209
I have a son and I need help taking care of you.

14
00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:26.939
You have a son?

15
00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:27.939
You have a son?

16
00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:28.939
Yeah, I do.

17
00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:30.939
Were you married?

18
00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:34.579
No, I was never married, but I do have a son.

19
00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:41.579
Is that a problem?

20
00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:56.650
No, he reminds me of Henry when he was a little...

21
00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.849
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, where did this kid come from?

22
00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:03.769
I'm here to see my mom, she's here to find daddy.

23
00:02:03.769 --> 00:02:08.939
Well, you can't go through there, but you can sit over here and wait.

24
00:02:08.939 --> 00:02:09.939
JJ?

25
00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:12.819
Mom, they want to let me in to see you.

26
00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:14.180
JJ, what are you doing here?

27
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.060
I came over from Sammy's house because I wanted to be with you.

28
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.620
JJ, I'm working right now.

29
00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.060
You need to stay with Sammy until I come pick you up, okay?

30
00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.060
No chocolate tonight.

31
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:30.759
Does that kid look like he's about seven years old?

32
00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:35.520
Is this your son?

33
00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.520
Is this your son?

34
00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.909
Yes, this is my son.

35
00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:41.909
Is this daddy?

36
00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:44.030
No, sweetie, this isn't daddy.

37
00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.669
I'm sorry, Mr. Anderson.

38
00:02:45.669 --> 00:02:47.469
No, it's okay.

39
00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:48.469
Hey, JJ.

40
00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:49.469
Don't be sad.

41
00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:53.909
You know, if you're sad, then mommy might be sad, too.

42
00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:59.969
Here, for you, here.

43
00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:01.889
Are there peanuts in this?

44
00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:03.050
I'm sorry, Mr. Anderson.

45
00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.689
He's allergic to peanuts.

46
00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:07.870
Oh, he is.

47
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:08.870
So am I.

48
00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.129
How about that?

49
00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:14.870
Okay, I'm going to take you home now, okay?

50
00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.469
Daddy isn't joining us for dinner.

51
00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:20.740
He's not daddy, sweetie.

52
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:21.740
I'm sorry.

53
00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.860
And you know that's actually not such a bad idea.

54
00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:26.180
I'm really joining you guys for dinner.

55
00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.180
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Anderson.

56
00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.180
I only have enough for the two of us.

57
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.180
Oh, come on.

58
00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.180
Don't worry about that.

59
00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.180
You can come cook at my place.

60
00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.900
You've got plenty of space and a kitchen full of ingredients.

61
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.569
Hey, Samuel, good to go.

62
00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:42.770
That's really nice of you, but I don't want to be in any trouble.

63
00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:43.770
Nonsense.

64
00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:46.689
You are my girlfriend, after all.

65
00:03:46.689 --> 00:04:07.569
Come on, let's go.

66
00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:08.569
Dinner is served.

67
00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:11.199
I'm here, mama.

68
00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:13.639
You never cook this much for me.

69
00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.680
Well, that's a good thing that I'm here.

70
00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.019
Here, Mr. Anderson, try this.

71
00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:23.980
How long is it going to take you to adjust to being my girlfriend?

72
00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:24.980
Call me Henry.

73
00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:26.050
I'm Mr. Anderson.

74
00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:27.050
Henry, try this.

75
00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.389
Thank you.

76
00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:31.189
You like to separate out your veggies like JJ?

77
00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:52.689
Yeah, I guess we both don't like carrots.

78
00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:54.490
You can remember that for next time.

79
00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:55.490
Right.

80
00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.420
Sorry.

81
00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:58.420
Don't need to apologize.

82
00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:59.420
I'm only teasing.

83
00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:01.579
I do love mashed potatoes.

84
00:05:01.579 --> 00:05:04.360
Do you have any food preferences?

85
00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.949
Oh, I'm not picky, but I'm not a fan of onions.

86
00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:11.459
I don't remember that.

87
00:05:11.459 --> 00:05:14.420
You know, I don't think that kids should be picky eaters.

88
00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:18.509
Mommy, he's being hypocritical.

89
00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:27.449
It's hypocritical.

90
00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:28.449
But this is delicious.

91
00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:31.810
Emily, thank you so much for preparing me today.

92
00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:32.810
It's nothing.

93
00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:33.810
Really?

94
00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.050
Thank you for not firing me today.

95
00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:47.220
Okay.

96
00:05:47.579 --> 00:05:52.550
Take it.

97
00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:53.550
Thank you.

98
00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:55.730
Some of these amazing veggies.

99
00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:56.730
Thank you.

100
00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:57.730
Oh.

101
00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:58.730
Oh.

102
00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:09.420
Oh.

103
00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:10.899
Alex, darling, can you hear me in the sunscreen?

104
00:06:10.899 --> 00:06:20.750
It was surprising to see Emily again after all these years.

105
00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:21.750
What?

106
00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:22.750
More like embarrassing.

107
00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:24.750
That girl is a total loser.

108
00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:27.670
She should have never come in and ruin her night like that.

109
00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:31.350
I guess I was just curious what she's been up to for so long.

110
00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:33.310
Did you happen to get her contact info?

111
00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:34.310
Yeah.

112
00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:36.910
What?

113
00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:37.910
No.

114
00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:40.829
Grace to my family.

115
00:06:40.829 --> 00:06:44.790
She did everyone a favor when she disappeared seven years ago, especially for you.

116
00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:47.360
Don't be so harsh on her.

117
00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.879
Don't you care?

118
00:06:48.879 --> 00:06:52.500
You were family at one point.

119
00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:55.819
She made my childhood nothing but miserable, okay?

120
00:06:55.819 --> 00:06:59.139
Alex, I don't want to hear about Emily anymore.

121
00:06:59.139 --> 00:07:05.829
I didn't think it was such a big deal, but whatever you say.

122
00:07:05.829 --> 00:07:16.160
Emily, you should have never returned.

123
00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.649
Like hell, I didn't get the part.

124
00:07:18.649 --> 00:07:20.490
Don't they know my fiance's Alex Taylor?

125
00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:39.639
He can pull their funding at any time.

126
00:07:39.639 --> 00:07:40.639
Oh, it's you.

127
00:07:40.639 --> 00:07:41.639
What are you doing here?

128
00:07:41.639 --> 00:07:43.019
I work here.

129
00:07:43.019 --> 00:08:01.399
Don't think this is your chance to get close to Alex or anything like that.

130
00:08:01.399 --> 00:08:02.800
Know your place, Emily.

131
00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.879
You're just some hotel worker, okay?

132
00:08:05.879 --> 00:08:19.970
Alex barely even remembers you.

133
00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:22.779
We have a celebrity saying with us tonight.

134
00:08:22.779 --> 00:08:23.779
Sophia Walton.

135
00:08:23.779 --> 00:08:28.139
Now these items are to go to her room.

136
00:08:28.139 --> 00:08:29.139
Come on everybody, chop chop.

137
00:08:29.139 --> 00:08:34.019
Here, let me help.

138
00:08:34.019 --> 00:08:35.019
Oh my.

139
00:08:35.019 --> 00:08:36.019
This will send me.

140
00:08:36.019 --> 00:08:37.019
I'll handle it.

141
00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:38.100
I'll handle it.

142
00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:40.100
I wouldn't want you to over-exert yourself.

143
00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:42.659
Who else is going to pull Mr. Anderson's coffee?

144
00:08:42.659 --> 00:08:50.549
I was just trying to help.

145
00:08:50.549 --> 00:08:55.649
Everybody stop.

146
00:08:55.649 --> 00:08:57.090
There's more to lost something.

147
00:08:57.090 --> 00:08:58.929
No one leaves until we find it.

148
00:08:58.929 --> 00:08:59.929
Come on.

149
00:08:59.929 --> 00:09:00.990
Approach.

150
00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:04.019
Give me the pocket.

151
00:09:04.019 --> 00:09:05.110
Mm-hmm.

152
00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:06.590
What about that?

153
00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:07.590
What about that?

154
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:08.879
What about that?

155
00:09:08.879 --> 00:09:10.740
What about that?

156
00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:11.740
It's Emily.

157
00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:12.740
She didn't.

158
00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:16.419
No, I didn't steal this.

159
00:09:16.419 --> 00:09:17.659
I didn't take this.

160
00:09:17.659 --> 00:09:18.659
I was framed.

161
00:09:19.419 --> 00:09:20.419
Framed?

162
00:09:20.419 --> 00:09:22.100
Why would anyone frame you?

163
00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:24.179
This is a hotel not the CIA.

164
00:09:24.179 --> 00:09:26.389
I recognize you.

165
00:09:26.389 --> 00:09:28.149
It was you in the bathroom.

166
00:09:28.149 --> 00:09:29.350
You stole my ring.

167
00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:30.470
You set me up.

168
00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:31.470
I didn't take it.

169
00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:33.110
Can't we check the cameras or something?

170
00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:35.950
There's no surveillance in the bathroom.

171
00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:37.549
It was obvious you stole it.

172
00:09:37.549 --> 00:09:42.820
If you have my ring, you should be fired.

173
00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:45.980
Emily, we're going to have to tell Mr. Anderson about this.

174
00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:47.860
I didn't do anything wrong.

175
00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:49.220
Can't we do something about this?

176
00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:50.220
No need to freak out.

177
00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:51.220
Okay?

178
00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:52.220
Just say I'm sorry.

179
00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:55.740
Get on your knees and apologize and I'll forgive you.

180
00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:58.019
I'm not apologizing for something I didn't do.

181
00:09:58.019 --> 00:09:59.019
Just do it.

182
00:09:59.019 --> 00:10:00.019
Let's do it.

183
00:10:00.019 --> 00:10:02.230
Hey.

184
00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:04.230
Don't touch my girlfriend.

185
00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:05.230
Girlfriend.

186
00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:07.460
What's going on here?

187
00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:10.000
She's accusing me of stealing your ring.

188
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000
Did you?

189
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000
No, of course not.

190
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.600
If you're kissing her a theft, what's your proof?

191
00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:15.600
She had it on her.

192
00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:27.700
Who else would it be?

193
00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:31.340
So, can you now say that she stole my watch?

194
00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:34.529
Mr. Anderson.

195
00:10:34.529 --> 00:10:36.690
Just a demonstration.

196
00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:40.850
The ring is much smaller than this watch.

197
00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:46.289
And if I was quicker with no surveillance, you would be in the same boat, wouldn't you?

198
00:10:46.289 --> 00:10:48.299
Emily is my girlfriend.

199
00:10:48.299 --> 00:10:53.129
Do you think she would stoop so low as to steal a ring?

200
00:10:53.129 --> 00:10:54.129
Whatever.

201
00:10:54.129 --> 00:11:04.700
Come on, you top top, get back to it.

202
00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:05.700
Thank you.

203
00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:06.700
Mr. Anderson.

204
00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:08.059
There's no need to thank me.

205
00:11:08.059 --> 00:11:10.100
And remember, you can call me Henry.

206
00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:11.100
Henry.

207
00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:12.100
Right.

208
00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:13.100
Sorry.

209
00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:14.100
I forgot.

210
00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:16.100
Is there something between you and Sophia?

211
00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:17.100
No.

212
00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:21.750
Um, probably just a case of not hitting an off.

213
00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:25.950
Emily, I need to emphasize that you are now my girlfriend.

214
00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:26.950
I know.

215
00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:27.950
I'm sorry, Mr.

216
00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:28.950
Henry.

217
00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:32.340
I just, I'm having a stupid day.

218
00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:34.259
You don't need to apologize.

219
00:11:34.259 --> 00:11:36.259
It's sorry the only thing you know how to say.

220
00:11:37.639 --> 00:11:43.090
Oh, Mr. Anderson, I just remembered you have something for Emily, don't you?

221
00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:44.090
You're right.

222
00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:45.090
Thank you.

223
00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:46.730
Samuel.

224
00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:47.759
Oh.

225
00:11:47.759 --> 00:11:53.179
What's this?

226
00:11:53.179 --> 00:11:54.179
This is for you.

227
00:11:54.179 --> 00:11:57.350
Oh, my God.

228
00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:58.350
That's beautiful.

229
00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:00.480
I can't accept that.

230
00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.279
It's from the partners.

231
00:12:02.279 --> 00:12:03.279
It's something major.

232
00:12:03.279 --> 00:12:08.690
Isn't this a limited edition of Sawyer?

233
00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:14.320
I mean, with the clarity and refraction of this diamond, it's worth like tens of thousands.

234
00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:16.279
Definitely not nothing major.

235
00:12:16.639 --> 00:12:18.639
So you know a lot about jewelry.

236
00:12:18.639 --> 00:12:24.639
I learned a few things from some colleagues, but I really can't accept this.

237
00:12:24.639 --> 00:12:25.639
I insist.

238
00:12:25.639 --> 00:12:40.820
It's beautiful.

239
00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:42.850
Hey, what's this?

240
00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:43.850
Nothing.

241
00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:48.269
It's who knows what it might mean to me.

242
00:12:48.269 --> 00:12:49.830
I can't let them see.

243
00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:52.629
My son's father gave it to me a while ago.

244
00:12:52.629 --> 00:12:53.629
It's nothing.

245
00:12:53.629 --> 00:12:54.629
Let me see.

246
00:12:54.629 --> 00:12:55.629
No, no.

247
00:12:55.629 --> 00:12:56.629
Emily, come on.

248
00:12:56.629 --> 00:13:02.080
What are you doing?

249
00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:03.080
Just...

250
00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:04.370
Oh.

251
00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:05.370
I should leave.

252
00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:17.059
Yeah.

253
00:13:17.139 --> 00:13:21.470
Mr. Anderson, I finished today's reports.

254
00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:22.470
Mr. Anderson?

255
00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:24.659
Are you okay?

256
00:13:24.659 --> 00:13:25.980
Uh...

257
00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:27.240
Samuel?

258
00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:29.370
What's going on?

259
00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:31.730
Mr. Anderson just lost $100 million.

260
00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:32.730
$100 million?

261
00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:36.139
What are you talking about?

262
00:13:36.139 --> 00:13:37.429
Come here.

263
00:13:37.429 --> 00:13:38.429
Hey.

264
00:13:38.429 --> 00:13:39.429
Hey, Mr. Anderson.

265
00:13:39.429 --> 00:13:40.429
Come here.

266
00:13:40.429 --> 00:13:41.429
Come here.

267
00:13:41.429 --> 00:13:42.429
I'll take you home.

268
00:13:42.429 --> 00:13:43.429
I'll take you home.

269
00:13:43.429 --> 00:13:44.429
Yeah.

270
00:13:44.429 --> 00:13:45.429
I'm sorry.

271
00:13:45.429 --> 00:13:46.590
I'm sorry.

272
00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:47.590
All right.

273
00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:48.590
Buddy.

274
00:13:49.659 --> 00:13:51.200
Oh well.

275
00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:54.620
The plan's been into the works for so long.

276
00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:56.179
The balance finally took debate.

277
00:13:56.179 --> 00:14:37.669
Yeah, we're going to rank any bit more.

278
00:14:37.669 --> 00:14:38.669
Not yet.

279
00:14:38.669 --> 00:14:40.220
They're not ready.

280
00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:41.220
What's going on?

281
00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:42.740
I should be asking you that.

282
00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:46.820
You were really drunk last night and I didn't think you were going to make it home so I brought

283
00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:47.820
you back with me.

284
00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:48.820
I see.

285
00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:49.820
Thank you.

286
00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:50.820
Emily.

287
00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:52.659
I'll pay you extra for your troubles.

288
00:14:52.659 --> 00:14:58.279
No, I can't take your money, especially seeing as you don't have much left.

289
00:14:58.279 --> 00:14:59.279
What are you talking about?

290
00:14:59.279 --> 00:15:00.720
Don't try to hide it from me.

291
00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:01.879
Samuel told me everything.

292
00:15:01.879 --> 00:15:06.129
You lost 100 million dollars.

293
00:15:06.129 --> 00:15:08.730
No, I think there's a misunderstanding.

294
00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:09.730
It's okay.

295
00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:10.730
Really.

296
00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:14.179
You can stay with Jack and I until you get back on your feet.

297
00:15:14.179 --> 00:15:16.299
It's really sweet.

298
00:15:16.299 --> 00:15:18.620
But what is all this red for?

299
00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:22.139
Oh, I'm going to the market today to sell some of my baked goods.

300
00:15:22.139 --> 00:15:24.779
I want to help out, you know, financially.

301
00:15:24.779 --> 00:15:26.019
I don't think the...

302
00:15:26.019 --> 00:15:27.019
It's okay.

303
00:15:27.019 --> 00:15:28.620
Money troubles are temporary.

304
00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:33.240
And now that we're a couple, I figured I could help.

305
00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:41.759
Trust me.

306
00:15:41.759 --> 00:16:01.539
Since we're official, then I'll come help.

307
00:16:01.539 --> 00:16:03.539
Fresh pastries, lemonade.

308
00:16:03.539 --> 00:16:04.539
Hey.

309
00:16:04.539 --> 00:16:05.539
Look at all this.

310
00:16:05.539 --> 00:16:06.539
Yeah.

311
00:16:06.539 --> 00:16:09.789
I'm going to try it with you.

312
00:16:09.789 --> 00:16:16.580
Sure.

313
00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:17.580
You made these?

314
00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:18.580
Mm-hmm.

315
00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:19.620
They're amazing.

316
00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:20.620
Thank you.

317
00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:22.350
Oh, hi.

318
00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:23.350
Yeah, same.

319
00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:24.350
Thanks to you.

320
00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:28.200
Emily thinks I'm broke.

321
00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:37.549
So now I am helping her sell pastries on the street.

322
00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:40.639
It's been a lot of the morning.

323
00:16:40.639 --> 00:16:41.639
No need.

324
00:16:41.639 --> 00:16:44.039
Just make sure everybody's aware of the investment mess and things are going to go according

325
00:16:44.039 --> 00:16:45.039
to plan.

326
00:16:45.039 --> 00:16:46.039
Okay, I'll talk to you.

327
00:16:46.039 --> 00:16:52.639
Here, let me help with that.

328
00:16:52.639 --> 00:16:53.799
I am so sorry.

329
00:16:53.799 --> 00:16:54.799
I...

330
00:16:54.799 --> 00:16:55.799
That was totally...

331
00:16:55.799 --> 00:16:56.799
It's okay.

332
00:16:56.799 --> 00:16:57.799
I apologize.

333
00:16:57.799 --> 00:16:58.799
I'm so sorry.

334
00:16:58.799 --> 00:16:59.799
It's okay.

335
00:16:59.799 --> 00:17:03.799
Why don't you help with the lemonade?

336
00:17:03.799 --> 00:17:04.799
That should be easy.

337
00:17:04.799 --> 00:17:05.960
Yeah.

338
00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:06.960
Sure.

339
00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:07.960
Yeah, I can do that.

340
00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:08.960
Just pour a glass.

341
00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:09.960
Right.

342
00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:10.960
Yeah, just pour a couple of glass.

343
00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:11.960
Sure.

344
00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:15.490
Thank you.

345
00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:16.490
I'm so sorry.

346
00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:17.490
Are you okay?

347
00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:19.859
Yeah.

348
00:17:19.859 --> 00:17:20.859
Um, here.

349
00:17:20.859 --> 00:17:23.460
I don't even know what happened.

350
00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:24.460
It's fine.

351
00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:25.460
Thank you.

352
00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:26.460
I'm just happy you came.

353
00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:27.500
Of course.

354
00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:32.880
Yeah.

355
00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:35.549
How'd you get to running a stall here?

356
00:17:35.549 --> 00:17:38.109
Mr. Anderson's really in a pickle, huh?

357
00:17:38.109 --> 00:17:40.220
Seems like he got ditched.

358
00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:41.220
And guess what?

359
00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:43.460
The Brown's just scored a major deal.

360
00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:46.460
Looks like they could break in 50 million.

361
00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:50.460
Unlike some folks, you seem to have no shame in making a public spectacle of yourself.

362
00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:53.690
There's nothing wrong with starting from scratch.

363
00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:54.690
Sure.

364
00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:55.690
Sure.

365
00:17:55.690 --> 00:17:56.690
You keep telling yourself that.

366
00:17:56.690 --> 00:17:59.690
Hey, don't touch it if you're not going to pay for it.

367
00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:00.690
Hey.

368
00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:04.849
Well, Mr. Anderson, don't mess with me.

369
00:18:04.849 --> 00:18:09.369
Losing millions and still thinking that you can cling on to your little CEO position.

370
00:18:09.369 --> 00:18:14.289
I mean, while my father's putting all his cash into his new project and we're expecting

371
00:18:14.289 --> 00:18:20.809
a 50 million dollar return, so play your cards right and maybe, just maybe.

372
00:18:21.809 --> 00:18:23.569
I'll put in a good word for you.

373
00:18:23.569 --> 00:18:25.049
No need.

374
00:18:25.049 --> 00:18:27.049
That kind of money has done even bad nylash.

375
00:18:27.049 --> 00:18:28.049
Big talk.

376
00:18:28.049 --> 00:18:32.089
Yeah, here you are selling dough on the street.

377
00:18:32.089 --> 00:18:37.089
Hey.

378
00:18:37.089 --> 00:18:41.369
I could squash you like a bun.

379
00:18:41.369 --> 00:18:43.849
So don't tell me what to do.

380
00:18:43.849 --> 00:18:44.849
Hey.

381
00:18:44.849 --> 00:18:53.049
You messed up the stand and you pay for it.

382
00:18:53.049 --> 00:18:54.210
It's fine, Henry.

383
00:18:54.210 --> 00:18:55.210
Just let her go.

384
00:18:55.210 --> 00:18:56.210
No.

385
00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:57.769
No, she needs to pay for it.

386
00:18:57.769 --> 00:19:01.069
Pay for this lame ass stand?

387
00:19:01.069 --> 00:19:02.549
Sure.

388
00:19:02.549 --> 00:19:04.960
Just swipe my card.

389
00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:05.960
Go ahead.

390
00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:07.440
I'll pay for everything.

391
00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:09.200
Trust me, it won't even dent.

392
00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:18.549
Okay.

393
00:19:18.549 --> 00:19:19.549
It declined.

394
00:19:19.549 --> 00:19:22.150
What?

395
00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:25.839
Try it again.

396
00:19:25.839 --> 00:19:27.440
It declined again.

397
00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:28.839
You might want to call your bank.

398
00:19:28.839 --> 00:19:29.839
Don't be ridiculous.

399
00:19:29.839 --> 00:19:30.839
You're a stupid machine.

400
00:19:30.839 --> 00:19:31.839
It's busted.

401
00:19:31.839 --> 00:19:32.839
Blend up.

402
00:19:32.839 --> 00:19:33.839
Look at the news.

403
00:19:33.839 --> 00:19:38.359
The Anderson just made 200 million in a new deal.

404
00:19:38.359 --> 00:19:39.359
Your family.

405
00:19:39.359 --> 00:19:40.359
Oh.

406
00:19:40.359 --> 00:19:41.359
It's declared pink.

407
00:19:41.359 --> 00:19:42.359
No.

408
00:19:42.359 --> 00:19:43.359
No, no, no.

409
00:19:43.359 --> 00:19:44.359
That's impossible.

410
00:19:44.359 --> 00:20:02.559
Hello, Daddy.

411
00:20:02.559 --> 00:20:05.079
Mr. Anderson, please don't do this to our family.

412
00:20:05.079 --> 00:20:08.750
That's the price you pay for being too greedy.

413
00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:11.990
Go.

414
00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:12.990
Okay.

415
00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:16.140
So you're not flat out broke.

416
00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:17.140
That's good.

417
00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:18.269
Yeah.

418
00:20:18.269 --> 00:20:19.269
Are you pleased?

419
00:20:19.269 --> 00:20:20.269
Yeah.

420
00:20:20.269 --> 00:20:21.269
Hey.

421
00:20:21.269 --> 00:20:22.269
Let's celebrate.

422
00:20:22.269 --> 00:20:23.269
I know the best.

423
00:20:23.269 --> 00:20:24.950
Oh, Mikasi Fles.

424
00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:26.750
We don't have to go out and splurge.

425
00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:29.940
I can make something at home.

426
00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:31.259
All right.

427
00:20:31.259 --> 00:20:32.940
I need to run to the hotel first, but...

428
00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:33.940
Yes.

429
00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:34.940
I will meet you at home.

430
00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:35.940
Okay.

431
00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:36.940
Can you help?

432
00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:37.940
No.

433
00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:38.940
No.

434
00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:45.420
Thank you.

435
00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:46.420
Sure.

436
00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:47.420
Thank you.

437
00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:56.130
Okay.

438
00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:58.089
I'll see you there.

439
00:20:58.089 --> 00:20:59.089
Hey, Sofia.

440
00:20:59.089 --> 00:21:22.869
I need your help.

441
00:21:22.869 --> 00:21:23.869
Sure.

442
00:21:23.869 --> 00:21:24.869
Try someplace.

443
00:21:24.869 --> 00:21:27.410
Don't you ever get in my way again.

444
00:21:27.410 --> 00:21:29.140
Yeah, you got that.

445
00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:30.880
Stop it.

446
00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:31.880
Shh.

447
00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:32.880
You're just a big mistake.

448
00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:33.880
But...

449
00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:34.880
Do you have any idea who I am?

450
00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:38.559
Does the name Henry Anderson bring any bells?

451
00:21:38.559 --> 00:21:40.240
The police are already on their way.

452
00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:43.000
I suggest the two of you leave Anderson.

453
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.130
We should go.

454
00:21:44.130 --> 00:21:57.799
My goodness.

455
00:21:57.799 --> 00:21:58.799
Are you okay?

456
00:21:58.799 --> 00:21:59.799
You're here.

457
00:21:59.799 --> 00:22:00.799
I'm so sorry.

458
00:22:00.799 --> 00:22:04.579
But it took so long for me to get here.

459
00:22:04.579 --> 00:22:07.460
I'm going to send someone over to help you guys move tomorrow.

460
00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:08.460
Move.

461
00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:11.460
I think it'll be a lot safer for you and JJ if you come and live with me.

462
00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:14.460
We don't know who sent those guys and they could come back.

463
00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:16.579
Anyways.

464
00:22:16.579 --> 00:22:17.579
We're a couple now.

465
00:22:17.579 --> 00:22:20.089
All right.

466
00:22:20.089 --> 00:22:21.309
Let me.

467
00:22:21.309 --> 00:22:22.309
Let me talk to JJ.

468
00:22:22.309 --> 00:22:23.309
Okay.

469
00:22:23.309 --> 00:22:39.700
Dr.

470
00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:41.769
How was my son?

471
00:22:41.769 --> 00:22:42.769
Okay.

472
00:22:42.769 --> 00:22:49.390
So based on the test results, your child's white blood cell count is abnormally low.

473
00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:51.789
Has he had any past illnesses?

474
00:22:51.789 --> 00:22:53.869
When he was three, he had leukemia.

475
00:22:53.869 --> 00:22:58.410
But we found a bone marrow donor and he's been in remission since then.

476
00:22:58.410 --> 00:22:59.410
I see.

477
00:22:59.410 --> 00:23:00.410
Well, he's young.

478
00:23:00.410 --> 00:23:02.730
But his immune system is really weak.

479
00:23:02.730 --> 00:23:08.730
So you should be prepared for potential relapse, maybe even another bone marrow transplant.

480
00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:11.049
Unfortunately, I'm not a match.

481
00:23:11.049 --> 00:23:12.049
Okay.

482
00:23:12.049 --> 00:23:15.650
So we'll need to find a donor as soon as possible.

483
00:23:15.650 --> 00:23:19.200
The kid is in stable condition right now, which is great.

484
00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:22.970
But we should be prepared in case anything changes.

485
00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:28.460
Is there any way you can get in contact with his father?

486
00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:29.460
Yeah.

487
00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:30.460
I can work on that.

488
00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:31.460
Okay.

489
00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:40.299
Great.

490
00:23:40.299 --> 00:23:41.299
Excellent.

491
00:23:41.299 --> 00:23:42.779
Hey, Mom.

492
00:23:42.779 --> 00:23:45.029
What's up?

493
00:23:45.029 --> 00:23:46.029
I'm so excited.

494
00:23:46.029 --> 00:23:47.029
I'm not a Sophia.

495
00:23:47.029 --> 00:23:48.160
Have you thought about it?

496
00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:49.160
I've had you for the wedding.

497
00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:51.000
I guess me and Sophia decided to make it happen.

498
00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:57.720
Just give me one second while I have a word with my fiance.

499
00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:00.000
What did you tell my mom?

500
00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.799
Why is she talking about the wedding again?

501
00:24:01.799 --> 00:24:03.519
I might have mentioned something.

502
00:24:03.519 --> 00:24:06.269
You know, we've been gaged for so long.

503
00:24:06.269 --> 00:24:07.630
What do you think is about time?

504
00:24:07.630 --> 00:24:09.509
I can't think about this right now.

505
00:24:09.509 --> 00:24:12.660
We'll discuss it later.

506
00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:14.900
You're still thinking about Emily, aren't you?

507
00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:17.059
You haven't seen her for seven years and she cheated on you.

508
00:24:17.059 --> 00:24:18.420
Why are you still obsessed with her?

509
00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:19.420
Are you crazy?

510
00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:21.500
Why would you even bring that up again?

511
00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:25.799
Well, I guess I can't guarantee that everything's going to go smoothly then.

512
00:24:25.799 --> 00:24:27.880
I guess Emily and her new job at the hotel.

513
00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:32.880
And I would hate for your company not to be able to close its latest deal with the studio

514
00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:33.880
I'm working with.

515
00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:40.140
It would be such a shame for me not to put in a good word with my executive friends while

516
00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:41.140
it takes us one call.

517
00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:44.779
But that's only if we don't get married.

518
00:24:44.779 --> 00:24:50.339
So, what do you say, baby?

519
00:24:50.339 --> 00:25:04.380
I knew you'd come around.

520
00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:07.410
Well, I guess the wedding's happening after all.

521
00:25:07.410 --> 00:25:09.180
Can you do me a favor?

522
00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:15.220
Can you put Emily Wilson on the wedding invitation list, but please don't let Sophia

523
00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:16.220
know about it.

524
00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:17.220
Okay, thanks.

525
00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:30.529
It's odd that Sophia would invite me to her wedding.

526
00:25:30.529 --> 00:25:31.529
Maybe it was Alex.

527
00:25:31.529 --> 00:25:34.619
It could be an opportunity to look for Jack's father.

528
00:25:34.619 --> 00:25:40.470
It's going to be a banquet at my house in a few days.

529
00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:42.630
You're going to be coming as my guest.

530
00:25:42.630 --> 00:25:43.630
Sure.

531
00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:44.700
What are the dates?

532
00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:45.700
The 23rd.

533
00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:50.299
Oh, um, I think I have something that day actually.

534
00:25:50.299 --> 00:25:54.750
What are you hiding from me?

535
00:26:00.359 --> 00:26:10.990
What is this?

536
00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:12.990
My answer's welcome to them.

537
00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:13.990
She invited me.

538
00:26:13.990 --> 00:27:01.819
I think it would be rude not to show up.

539
00:27:01.819 --> 00:27:02.819
But I...

540
00:27:02.819 --> 00:27:03.819
Please leave.

541
00:27:03.819 --> 00:27:07.180
This is a private event and then you need to go.

542
00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:08.339
She's here on my invitation.

543
00:27:08.339 --> 00:27:13.240
Is there a problem?

544
00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:17.900
Emily, I need to talk to you in something.

545
00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:20.579
Um, people are looking for you and your parents are waiting?

546
00:27:20.579 --> 00:27:23.220
Of course.

547
00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:25.180
Find me later.

548
00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:29.700
Come with me.

549
00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:39.980
What are you doing here?

550
00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:40.980
This is my engagement party.

551
00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:42.980
You're coming and making everything about yourself.

552
00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:45.380
I didn't come here to ruin your party, okay?

553
00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:47.779
I came here to find out what happened here seven years ago.

554
00:27:47.779 --> 00:27:50.660
And I think you know what I'm talking about.

555
00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:55.339
Seven years ago, you're talking about your engagement party or that lively night in the

556
00:27:55.339 --> 00:27:57.700
attic you had with your baby daddy.

557
00:27:57.700 --> 00:27:59.539
So you do know.

558
00:27:59.539 --> 00:28:01.339
Who was that man in the attic, Sophia?

559
00:28:01.339 --> 00:28:02.539
Who's the father of my child?

560
00:28:02.539 --> 00:28:04.859
Emily, you messed around with some random guy.

561
00:28:04.859 --> 00:28:06.420
I know you're asking me who it was.

562
00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:07.420
I don't know.

563
00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:10.220
And the fact that you don't even know is honestly sad and pathetic.

564
00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:11.220
Fine.

565
00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:13.220
Then I'll just go ask Alex.

566
00:28:14.019 --> 00:28:16.779
Bitch, you are not seeing Alex use mine.

567
00:28:16.779 --> 00:28:20.180
Hey, can I borrow that camera for a second?

568
00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:21.180
Mr. Taylor.

569
00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:22.180
Here you go.

570
00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:23.180
Thank you.

571
00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:31.569
Where's Emily going?

572
00:28:31.569 --> 00:28:32.859
She's leaving, I guess.

573
00:28:32.859 --> 00:28:33.859
She just came to her senses.

574
00:28:33.859 --> 00:28:44.569
Come out of the blue and blue in my wedding.

575
00:28:44.569 --> 00:28:49.569
You are nothing but a poor, pathetic single mother that leeches off of other people.

576
00:28:49.569 --> 00:28:52.960
Honestly, I'm surprised you even thought you had a chance again.

577
00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:54.359
I stole Alex from you.

578
00:28:54.359 --> 00:28:55.799
I stole my life back from you.

579
00:28:55.799 --> 00:28:58.859
And trust me, I can steal more.

580
00:28:58.859 --> 00:28:59.859
Turn it off.

581
00:28:59.859 --> 00:29:00.859
Turn it off.

582
00:29:00.859 --> 00:29:01.859
Listen.

583
00:29:01.859 --> 00:29:02.859
Alex is Emily.

584
00:29:02.859 --> 00:29:03.859
That bitch.

585
00:29:03.859 --> 00:29:05.259
She's trying to set me up and steal you from me.

586
00:29:05.259 --> 00:29:07.660
I was the one who filmed it, Sophia.

587
00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:08.660
What?

588
00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:10.099
Why would you do that?

589
00:29:10.099 --> 00:29:15.740
I did it because now I know that you've been pretending to be sweet and caring to my

590
00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:22.259
face and a completely different person in front of everyone else, especially, I mean, are

591
00:29:22.259 --> 00:29:23.259
you right now?

592
00:29:23.259 --> 00:29:26.049
Not until I figure out who you really are.

593
00:29:26.049 --> 00:29:27.049
The wedding's off.

594
00:29:27.049 --> 00:29:44.220
I saw someone crying alone and I thought I'd come check it out.

595
00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:47.259
No need to worry.

596
00:29:47.259 --> 00:29:50.950
He seems pretty upset seeing Alex get married.

597
00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:51.950
It's not about me.

598
00:29:51.950 --> 00:29:58.980
If you love Alex so much, then why did you agree to the contract?

599
00:29:58.980 --> 00:29:59.819
Henry, are you?
