00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Henry, you have to listen to me.

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Yes, I knew Alex before, but that was in the past.

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Please don't be mad.

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.519
You're giving up on me so easily.

5
00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:15.519
I'm not mad.

6
00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:20.210
Then why did you walk away?

7
00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.239
Because just the thought of him kissing you

8
00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:27.239
and hugging you and touching you, I just...

9
00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:33.570
It's nothing like that.

10
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.240
We barely held hands.

11
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.240
I mean, he never even kissed me.

12
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:57.829
He's an idiot at first sight until the day.

13
00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:04.219
Then I come falling for you too, Henry.

14
00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:06.609
I guess we're not faking it anymore.

15
00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:08.609
I guess not.

16
00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:13.730
What about the contract? It says after three years we're not together.

17
00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.950
For now on, there is no contract.

18
00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:17.950
Really?

19
00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.689
I guess I've lost a lot of money then, huh?

20
00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.689
Then I'll just have to compensate you myself.

21
00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:25.689
Come on.

22
00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:26.689
Where are we going?

23
00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:28.650
I almost forgot.

24
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.189
Today's my birthday.

25
00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:35.909
I'm going to change into something more comfortable.
