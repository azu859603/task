00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.560
Oh, look at this.

2
00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:09.560
Isn't it a coincidence this girl also has the same surname Wilson, just like Emily?

3
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.560
Yeah, but that is interesting, Emily.

4
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.449
Thank you so much for coming. It was great to see you.

5
00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:20.449
Get home safe.

6
00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:23.920
What does your grandma have to say?

7
00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.429
Nothing, nothing much.

8
00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:30.429
Would you like to dance?

9
00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:36.250
Sure, Mr. Anderson, lead the way.

10
00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:37.250
Call me.

11
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.549
Hey, don't be nervous.

12
00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:44.549
No matter how you dance, everybody will applaud.

13
00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:58.140
It's like, you know, it's good, it's good.

14
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:10.799
It's Emily, that bitch is trying to steal Alex again.

15
00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:11.799
What do I do?

16
00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:13.799
You calm down, sweetheart.

17
00:01:14.959 --> 00:01:21.469
Leslie, are you sure this is gonna work?

18
00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:24.469
If you can't have his heart, you take the rest of him.
