00:00:01,649 --> 00:00:05,650
Alex, darling. You've been working so hard. Why don't you just take a drink?

2
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:08,650
You don't need to do this anymore.

3
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:09,650
What?

4
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:13,650
This whole housewife routine. I don't need you bringing me drinks anymore.

5
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,650
How about one more for all time sakes?

6
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:27,219
This tastes funny. Do you do to me?

7
00:00:27,219 --> 00:00:35,340
You brought this upon yourself, Alex.

8
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:40,100
If I can't have you, I will destroy you.

9
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:46,340
You are mine. Always have been, always will be.

10
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:50,399
Henry. You've gathered all the information on Sophia.

11
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:51,399
Go on.

12
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:58,399
Sophia was originally born into the Walton family, but she was switched at birth and they did not discover the error until she was 16.

13
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,399
She went by the name Wilson.

14
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:06,400
The original Wilson daughter, the one that Sophia was switched with, was named Emily.

15
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:14,400
The Waltons adopted Emily and intended to raise the two girls together, but eventually for some reason she was kicked out of the house.

16
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:20,620
If Emily was originally a Walton then, was there a chance she was that woman from seven years ago?

17
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:27,140
She was expelled from the family house around the same time, but it's unlikely that she would have been at the event.

18
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:32,969
Understood. I need you to keep investigating the Waltons and her old school.

19
00:01:32,969 --> 00:01:34,969
We have to find this woman from seven years ago.

20
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:36,930
Sure.
