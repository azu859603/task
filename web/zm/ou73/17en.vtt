1
00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:10.500
on me. I didn't step on you. Ms. Emily, you are so rude. Is this how the Anderson

2
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.060
family treats their most esteemed guests? The Anderson Imperial Hotel treats people

3
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.940
with respect and kindness. We don't tolerate this kind of behavior.

4
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.219
Sophia, Emily, Sophia, Emily. Sophia, we heard that Alex fled from the wedding. What was the reason?

5
00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.250
Some say you're harassing Anderson's staff here on behalf of the Taylor family. Is that true?

6
00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.420
You should ask this wannabe Anderson about that. Emily, I know you envy Alex and target me for it,

7
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.820
but we have a great relationship and you don't see a chance between our love.

8
00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.420
Emily, is it true that you intervene causing the wedding to be canceled? What?

9
00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:47.329
Emily and I had nothing to do with the Walton Taylor wedding fiasco.

10
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.140
In fact, Emily and I are planning a wedding of our own.

11
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.799
We'll be more details to come, so please give us patience.

12
00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.689
Come on. Sophia, Sophia, Sophia, Emily, Emily, Emily.
