1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,480
Thank you for helping me out back there.

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,279
I meant every word that I said.

3
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:10,919
You become a member of the Anderson family.

4
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:12,919
They won't dare mess with you again.

5
00:00:12,919 --> 00:00:16,019
Henry, there's something I haven't told you yet.

6
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:19,739
Seven years ago, there was an accident and I got pregnant.

7
00:00:19,739 --> 00:00:22,239
When Jack was three, he developed leukemia

8
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:25,579
and there's a chance of a relapse now.

9
00:00:25,579 --> 00:00:28,379
I need to find his father for treatment.

10
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:30,679
I think Sophia might have something to do with it

11
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:32,979
and that's why I went to her wedding.

12
00:00:32,979 --> 00:00:35,009
I'm still looking for Jack's father.

13
00:00:35,009 --> 00:00:38,710
So, Sophia is behind all of this?

14
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:43,250
Not entirely sure.

15
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:48,920
Thank you. I'm sharing that.

16
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,420
I'm still going to help you find Jack's father.

17
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,789
I hope.

18
00:00:56,789 --> 00:00:58,289
Yes, they know.

19
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:01,789
Henry, we found the girl from seven years ago.

20
00:01:01,789 --> 00:01:03,789
I'll be right there.

21
00:01:03,789 --> 00:01:05,879
Sorry.
