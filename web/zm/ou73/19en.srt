00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,839
Samuel where is she in a small town outside of Santa Barbara? Okay, a range of meeting

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,359
I'll meet with her and I will make sure she's properly compensated. Mr. Anderson

3
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:13,039
I'm afraid things might not be how you imagine. What do you mean?

4
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:18,899
After that night she was kicked out of her house and

5
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:21,699
when we went to the school she had just dropped out

6
00:00:23,149 --> 00:00:31,100
Later on she tried to commit suicide. Is she even alive? Yes, but as a single mother

7
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:36,060
with no qualifications she's very limited on what she can do. What do you want to do?

8
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:41,859
Why are there no photos? Her identity had to have been intentionally hidden.

9
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:47,009
It's just going to take a bit more time. All right, work on this quickly. Thank you.

10
00:00:50,479 --> 00:01:13,420
I have to talk to Emily. Hey, how was work? It was fine. Emily, I love you.

11
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:20,340
What's going on? We have to break up. What?
