1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
What?

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,419
I'm sorry, but we have to break up.

3
00:00:04,419 --> 00:00:05,419
I don't understand.

4
00:00:05,419 --> 00:00:06,419
What?

5
00:00:06,419 --> 00:00:07,900
Is there something you're not telling me?

6
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:12,679
A long time ago, I hurt a very good girl.

7
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:16,719
She was forced to become a single mother because of me.

8
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:18,079
You say that so carelessly.

9
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:22,019
Do you understand how hard it is to be a single mom?

10
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:23,019
I know.

11
00:00:23,019 --> 00:00:27,179
And I have been searching for her to try and make amends and I just recently found out

12
00:00:27,179 --> 00:00:30,339
that she's been living a very difficult life.

13
00:00:30,339 --> 00:00:35,890
So I need to go to her and take responsibility for her and my child.

14
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:38,210
You should have done that a long time ago, Henry.

15
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:39,210
I know.

16
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:43,329
I'm still going to compensate you for everything that you've done far beyond what the contract

17
00:00:43,329 --> 00:00:44,969
says.

18
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:45,969
Don't bother.

19
00:00:45,969 --> 00:00:48,219
We'll just break up.

20
00:00:48,219 --> 00:00:50,259
Jack and I will move out tomorrow morning.

21
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:53,130
No wait, Emily.

22
00:00:53,130 --> 00:01:14,980
I still want to help you find Jack's father.

23
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,980
Why couldn't it have been you seven years ago?
