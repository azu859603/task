00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.250
Alex, guess what, you're pregnant.

2
00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:08.890
What?

3
00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:10.890
Are you sure this can't be right?

4
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:11.890
Yeah, I'm sure.

5
00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:12.890
Aren't you happy?

6
00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:17.620
Are you really not repulsed by me now?

7
00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:22.620
It was you who arranged Emily's Insta in the attic seven years ago, wasn't it?

8
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.620
Even if I said it wasn't, would you still believe me?

9
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:32.840
It's time to blow this whole thing wide open.

10
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.899
model?

11
00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:36.899
I don't know something wrong.

12
00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.899
No, sweetheart. We didn't do anything wrong.

13
00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.899
We're just not going to see Henry for a while, okay?

14
00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:43.899
They are so sad.

15
00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:44.899
We'll be okay.

16
00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:46.899
As long as we have each other, that's all that matters, right?

17
00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:50.179
Emily. Emily, Emily. Emily, Emily, Emily.

18
00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:52.179
Here to somebody with this child.

19
00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:55.179
Buddy. Is your dad Mr. Anderson or is that someone else?

20
00:00:55.179 --> 00:00:57.179
What's going on?

21
00:00:57.179 --> 00:00:59.179
Emily, are you Mr. Anderson's ex-girlfriend?

22
00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:02.619
You're gonna be too broke up. Can you tell us why?

23
00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:05.620
Take a look at these! These photos!

24
00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:25.230
Can Mr. Anderson break up with you because of this?
