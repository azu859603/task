1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:06,169
Get back, get back, get back, get back, get back, get back, and this should be the emergency

2
00:00:06,169 --> 00:00:07,169
protocol.

3
00:00:07,169 --> 00:00:08,619
Now, go!

4
00:00:08,619 --> 00:00:12,480
Get back, come on, stop.

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,480
You?

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:14,480
Manna, what are you doing here?

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,160
I heard you broke up with Emily.

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,600
Did you do something wrong?

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,000
Get Emily back right now, Henry.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,199
Do you want my help?

11
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:22,960
It is all my fault.

12
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,519
Of course it's all your fault.

13
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:29,359
I heard from Samuel that the girl in the photo that I gave you is actually meant to be

14
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:30,359
Emily.

15
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:32,640
But for some reason, there was a mix up with Sophia.

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,359
It's Destin, you and Emily were meant to be together.

17
00:00:38,359 --> 00:00:40,719
Samuel, what about the investigation?

18
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:41,799
We're getting close.
