00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.389
Hey, how's Jack?

2
00:00:06.389 --> 00:00:10.480
The doctor said the leukemia is coming back.

3
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.480
I need to find a new bone marrow donor.

4
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.480
Jack is going to be okay.

5
00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.480
I'm here to protect you both.

6
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.480
Really?

7
00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:17.480
Yes.

8
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:25.219
We can't be doing this.

9
00:00:25.219 --> 00:00:27.219
I'm only trying to help.

10
00:00:27.219 --> 00:00:30.219
It's just everything with Sophia and Jack.

11
00:00:30.219 --> 00:00:31.219
I think I need to leave.

12
00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:33.219
Maybe you shouldn't run.

13
00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:35.219
Anything you need I'll be here for.

14
00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.219
I don't know. I don't know what to do.

15
00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:39.219
Tell the truth.

16
00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:42.340
Show them the real brave Emily.

17
00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.340
The real brave Emily?

18
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.939
There is nothing to fear. All of those rumors are just lies.

19
00:00:49.939 --> 00:00:53.679
Thanks, Henry, but I have a plan.

20
00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:55.679
What are you going to do?

21
00:00:55.679 --> 00:00:57.679
I'm going to get Jack out of here.

22
00:00:57.679 --> 00:00:59.679
I can fight Sophia, but he can't.

23
00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:02.289
What about me?

24
00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:06.290
I'm just I'm saying that I'm here for you to help.

25
00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.609
We're not together anymore.

26
00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:11.019
I need to do this by myself.

27
00:01:11.019 --> 00:01:12.019
For Jack.
