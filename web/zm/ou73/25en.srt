1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,580
Who gave you this ring?

2
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:09,960
Someone who hurt me, a long time ago.

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,960
Who was that person, Jack's father?

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,960
Yes. Why do you care?

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,960
You must really hate him, don't you?

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,960
Shouldn't I hate someone that changed my life forever?

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,629
Yeah. You should.

8
00:00:21,629 --> 00:01:02,969
What do you want, Henry?

9
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:05,969
I have an idea. You can clear your name with the press.

10
00:01:05,969 --> 00:01:09,260
And maybe find Jack's father, too.

11
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:15,829
Henry, I'm nervous.

12
00:01:15,829 --> 00:01:17,829
It's okay. I'm here for you in every way.

13
00:01:17,829 --> 00:01:19,829
You trust me?

14
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:22,829
Mr. Anderson, everyone's here. It's almost time.

15
00:01:22,829 --> 00:01:25,340
You got this.

16
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:31,049
Good afternoon, everyone.

17
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:36,400
I would like to address the rumors about me and give a formal explanation.

18
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,560
Do we really have to do this?

19
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,750
She's being brave by stepping up and explaining.

20
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,750
Plus, I can't let her do this alone.

21
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:48,750
First of all, the photos that were taken were digitally manipulated.

22
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:53,260
As you can see, here and here, they're fakes.

23
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:57,260
As for the child, yes, I do have a son.

24
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,359
And I love him very much.

25
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:13,560
And the father, the father, I don't know, back then, I...

26
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,560
Who do you think you are, you shameless hag, dreaming of Mr. Anderson? You...

27
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,599
Henry!

28
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,629
I'm so sorry, Mr. Anderson. I...

29
00:02:24,629 --> 00:02:25,629
Are you kidding?

30
00:02:25,629 --> 00:02:35,099
As for the child, I would like to offer an explanation.

31
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:38,610
Seven years ago, Emily became pregnant.

32
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:41,960
And she was alone, and had to deal with that darkness herself.

33
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:46,819
And now today, she's still dealing with baseless accusations from you all.

34
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:51,020
Once I realized my mistake, I wanted to make a mess.

35
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:54,689
So seven years ago, I was the one...

36
00:02:54,689 --> 00:02:58,710
I was the one that left you to be alone.

37
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:00,810
And I want to make up for that.

38
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:06,750
Emily, apologize, and can you ever forgive me?

39
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,750
Henry, don't have to lie for me.

40
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:16,580
Emily Wilson, will you marry me?

41
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:20,889
What's going on here?

42
00:03:20,889 --> 00:03:42,150
Alex is done with you?

43
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,150
These are your things.

44
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:45,180
He doesn't want to see you around anymore.

45
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,340
I'm pregnant with this child.

46
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,340
Can I just tell them to deal with the Anderson's?

47
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,340
How would he treat me like this?

48
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,340
Where is he?

49
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:55,340
Miss Walton, please. He doesn't want to see you.

50
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:56,340
He did.

51
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:08,069
She went to go find Emily, didn't he?

52
00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:10,360
Doesn't he know she's about to get married?

53
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,710
Look, she won't get away with this.

54
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:13,710
Emily!

55
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:31,850
Emily, you're here.

56
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:34,519
So, would you want to tell me?

57
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:36,519
Isn't it you who asked me to come here?

58
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:38,519
Sophia said you wanted to see me.

59
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:39,519
She did.

60
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:45,430
Sophia, what are you doing?

61
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:47,430
Just clearing the obstacles between us.

62
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:50,430
Emily, come here to wake up.

63
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,819
What is this about? Are you insane?

64
00:04:52,819 --> 00:04:55,819
You think you two can create something new together?

65
00:04:55,819 --> 00:04:59,019
What did you do?

66
00:04:59,019 --> 00:05:04,009
I added a little something to your drink again.

67
00:05:04,009 --> 00:05:06,009
Alex, you know you're so naive.

68
00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:21,420
Henry's going to kill you.

69
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,420
You're going down.

70
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:43,639
Samuel, we've got to go.

71
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:49,180
Oh, it's me.

72
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:53,069
Oh, I can't move.

73
00:05:53,069 --> 00:05:54,069
Emily.

74
00:05:54,069 --> 00:05:59,220
No, it's fine.

75
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:06,089
Henry, you have to believe me. I didn't.

76
00:06:06,089 --> 00:06:08,089
Samuel, get the paparazzi out of here.

77
00:06:08,089 --> 00:06:10,089
I don't want to hear a word about this in the press.

78
00:06:10,089 --> 00:06:11,089
Come on, Emily.

79
00:06:11,089 --> 00:06:13,089
Say that one.

80
00:06:13,089 --> 00:06:14,790
Say that.

81
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:23,449
Henry, I'm okay.

82
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:24,449
Does anywhere else hurt?

83
00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:26,449
I think we should go to the hospital.

84
00:06:26,449 --> 00:06:29,410
No, it's nothing, really.

85
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:34,100
That's not nothing. We should get that looked at.

86
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:38,100
Will this incident affect you and your business?

87
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:42,100
Don't worry about that. Let me handle everything.

88
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,670
Okay. We got you.

89
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:56,779
Do I know you?

90
00:06:56,779 --> 00:07:00,149
I'm Patricia Anderson.

91
00:07:00,149 --> 00:07:04,149
I'm also the main shareholder of Anderson Imperial Hotel

92
00:07:04,149 --> 00:07:07,149
in case the name didn't make it clear for you.

93
00:07:07,149 --> 00:07:09,500
So spit it out.

94
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,500
How much money do you want to leave Henry?

95
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,500
No, Auntie, it's not like that.

96
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,500
Don't call me Auntie.

97
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,500
You're not married into the Anderson family yet.

98
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,500
Do you even realize how much Henry has lost because of you?

99
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,500
You can't even imagine.

100
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,500
So, you don't want money?

101
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,500
Didn't make this perfectly clear for you.

102
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:35,500
Get out of LA with your illegitimate child as soon as possible.

103
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,500
I'm not leaving unless Henry tells me to.

104
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,500
I made a promise to stay by his side and I intend to keep it.

105
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:46,500
Do you know how pathetic Henry looked at today's board meeting?

106
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,500
He almost passed out at our stock top 20%.

107
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,500
Is he okay?

108
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,500
No. What help can you offer him?

109
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,500
Except to bring him down.

110
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:00,569
Bitch. Stay away from Anderson's.

111
00:08:00,569 --> 00:08:03,170
Let's go.

112
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:06,509
There's our Uber. Ready?

113
00:08:06,509 --> 00:08:22,339
Samuel, I need you to keep an eye on Sophia.

114
00:08:22,339 --> 00:08:23,339
Copy.

115
00:08:23,339 --> 00:08:28,129
Make sure that Emily and Jack are safe.

116
00:08:28,129 --> 00:08:29,129
Got it.

117
00:08:29,129 --> 00:08:31,129
Henry, you need to take care of yourself too.

118
00:08:31,129 --> 00:08:34,129
You look like you were about to pass out this morning in the meeting.

119
00:08:34,129 --> 00:08:37,909
Henry, what?

120
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:39,909
It's Emily and Jack.

121
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:40,909
Something happened.

122
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:41,909
They didn't make it.

123
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:44,289
Mmm.

124
00:08:44,289 --> 00:08:48,730
Oh, that feels so good, honey.

125
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:51,049
You know how I like it.

126
00:08:51,049 --> 00:08:52,049
Mmm.

127
00:08:52,049 --> 00:08:58,919
Patricia, I need to talk to you.

128
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:02,559
What did you do to Emily?

129
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:04,559
She decided to leave on her own.

130
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:06,559
I didn't pressure her.

131
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,559
And if you use your dividends from the Anderson group,

132
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:11,559
what's going to happen to you and your little boyfriend?

133
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:12,559
I didn't do anything.

134
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:15,559
It was that girl from the Waltons who told me.

135
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:18,559
I just wanted Emily to leave you for the family's sake.

136
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:21,559
Everything else is not my concern.

137
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:22,559
Come, Sven.

138
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:30,370
Samuel, it's time to release all the information we have on Sophia.

139
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,039
Get it done.

140
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:51,350
Forgive me for not saying goodbye,

141
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:54,350
but I've been thinking a lot and I feel this might be for the best.

142
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:56,350
In the time we've spent together,

143
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:59,350
I've seen how much pressure you bear from everyone in your life.

144
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:02,450
I feel helpless when I see you face all that pressure alone.

145
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:06,450
And it hurts me even more when I realize I'm just a burden to you.

146
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:09,669
I'm deeply grateful for all that you've done for me and Jack.

147
00:10:09,669 --> 00:10:13,669
But I just can't stand watching you suffer because of someone you owe nothing to.

148
00:10:13,669 --> 00:10:16,700
I'm going to look for a new life in a different city.

149
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:21,700
I must have been crazy thinking I could track down Jack's real father in the first place.

150
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,700
So farewell for now.

151
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,700
And hopefully when you see me again,

152
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:28,700
I'll be the real brave Emily, just like you said.

153
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:37,289
What?

154
00:10:37,289 --> 00:10:38,289
Still alive?

155
00:10:38,289 --> 00:10:39,289
You piece of crap.

156
00:10:39,289 --> 00:10:40,289
Fine.

157
00:10:40,289 --> 00:10:41,700
Figure it out yourselves.

158
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,700
Sophia, your next gig just got cancelled.

159
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:49,220
This is up for me.

160
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,220
I'm Sophia Walton.

161
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,220
How dare they cancel.

162
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:54,220
Mr. Anderson arranged a public smear campaign against you.

163
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,220
None of the studios will take you now.

164
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,220
Look, here are some of the recent comments about you online.

165
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:04,220
Accusing you of bullying other actors on set and even tax evasion.

166
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:07,220
About two thirds of your fans have unfollowed you.

167
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,279
For David!

168
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:10,980
Sophia, the baby!

169
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,110
Yes.

170
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:14,110
Yes, I'm pregnant.

171
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:16,110
No, Alex, he won't abandon me.

172
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:19,110
Alex, darling, they're spreading all these lies about me online.

173
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:21,850
Did you kill Emily?

174
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:24,769
Don't be silly.

175
00:11:24,769 --> 00:11:25,769
Okay.

176
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:30,769
And now that Emily's gone, we can have a family and be together.

177
00:11:30,769 --> 00:11:31,769
Okay?

178
00:11:31,769 --> 00:11:32,769
Just forget about her.

179
00:11:32,769 --> 00:11:35,769
I will investigate Emily's disappearance.

180
00:11:35,769 --> 00:11:38,769
If I find out you did it, I will ruin you.

181
00:11:38,769 --> 00:11:40,830
Remember that one night?

182
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:43,149
We were so happy.

183
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,340
Sick.

184
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:52,909
What did you do to the baby?

185
00:11:52,909 --> 00:11:55,169
You made me do it.

186
00:11:55,169 --> 00:11:57,379
Guess what?

187
00:11:57,379 --> 00:12:00,379
Emily is not actually dead.

188
00:12:00,379 --> 00:12:03,059
Where is she?

189
00:12:03,059 --> 00:12:04,059
I will never tell you.

190
00:12:04,059 --> 00:12:06,059
You will never see her again.

191
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:08,059
At least not in this life.

192
00:12:08,059 --> 00:12:14,149
You're our hero, Bill.

193
00:12:14,149 --> 00:12:15,149
Thank you so much.

194
00:12:15,149 --> 00:12:16,149
You're welcome, Emily.

195
00:12:16,149 --> 00:12:18,149
I still remember how generous you were to me all those years ago.

196
00:12:18,149 --> 00:12:20,149
I wouldn't do I am today without you.

197
00:12:20,149 --> 00:12:22,149
So, everything set in Miami.

198
00:12:22,149 --> 00:12:24,149
Just relax and have a good trip.

199
00:12:24,149 --> 00:12:25,149
Thank you.

200
00:12:25,149 --> 00:12:26,149
Be careful.

201
00:12:26,149 --> 00:12:29,149
The car you're back to get into has been following you for a while.

202
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:32,149
You're probably trying to kidnap the boy.

203
00:12:32,149 --> 00:12:33,149
Bill?

204
00:12:33,149 --> 00:12:34,149
Is that you?

205
00:12:34,149 --> 00:12:35,149
Yes, Miss Emily.

206
00:12:35,149 --> 00:12:36,149
It's me.

207
00:12:36,149 --> 00:12:38,149
If Sophia doesn't succeed, she's not going to stop.

208
00:12:38,149 --> 00:12:39,149
Get in.

209
00:12:39,149 --> 00:12:42,899
Don't worry about Sophia.

210
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:45,899
I'll take care of her while you're safe and get away.

211
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:46,899
Please.

212
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:47,899
Take care of yourself and try.

213
00:12:47,899 --> 00:12:48,899
We will.

214
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:49,899
Be mommy.

215
00:12:49,899 --> 00:12:50,899
Be a stranger.

216
00:12:50,899 --> 00:12:53,899
Will we ever see Uncle Henry again?

217
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:54,899
We will.

218
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:57,570
Not for a while.

219
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:02,820
And we've got everyone looking, so have a new soon.

220
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:05,220
Okay.

221
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,220
Oh.

222
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,220
One more thing.

223
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,220
Sophia's outside, demanding to come in.

224
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,220
Get her out of here.

225
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,379
Hey, get out.

226
00:13:12,379 --> 00:13:14,379
I know where Emily is.

227
00:13:14,379 --> 00:13:15,379
I'm listening.

228
00:13:15,379 --> 00:13:16,379
I want $5 million.

229
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:18,379
Okay, let's go.

230
00:13:18,379 --> 00:13:20,379
I can make her come willingly.

231
00:13:20,379 --> 00:13:21,379
Hold it.

232
00:13:21,379 --> 00:13:22,379
But you can't know where she is.

233
00:13:22,379 --> 00:13:23,379
Henry, we can't trust her.

234
00:13:23,379 --> 00:13:25,379
I can't afford to lose Emily and Jack.

235
00:13:25,379 --> 00:13:26,379
Then pay me.

236
00:13:26,379 --> 00:13:28,379
And you'll be able to see them both.

237
00:13:28,379 --> 00:13:30,379
And how can I trust you?

238
00:13:30,379 --> 00:13:33,379
Unless you got any other ideas, I think I'm your best choice.

239
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:34,379
Fine.

240
00:13:34,379 --> 00:13:36,379
$5 million when you bring her here.

241
00:13:36,379 --> 00:13:37,379
No way.

242
00:13:37,379 --> 00:13:40,379
And how else are you going to get that kind of money?

243
00:13:40,379 --> 00:13:44,889
Three days from now, at my house.

244
00:13:44,889 --> 00:13:45,889
I'll let you know what time.

245
00:13:45,889 --> 00:13:57,419
I need you to show up.

246
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:00,419
This time, I will pay you ten times I did.

247
00:14:00,419 --> 00:14:02,419
Seven years ago.

248
00:14:02,419 --> 00:14:08,580
You're finally here.

249
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:11,059
Been waiting a long time.

250
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:12,860
Where is he?

251
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:15,860
Emily, I can't figure out how Henry treats you so well.

252
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:19,019
Why are you still hung up on some mystery guy?

253
00:14:19,019 --> 00:14:21,019
It's none of your business, Sophia.

254
00:14:21,019 --> 00:14:23,019
You grew up in this huge house.

255
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:24,019
My house.

256
00:14:24,019 --> 00:14:26,019
Do you have any idea how jealous I am of you?

257
00:14:26,019 --> 00:14:29,019
And Alex still can't get you out of his head.

258
00:14:29,019 --> 00:14:31,019
Do you understand how hard I worked for him?

259
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:34,019
I learned music, fashion, how to be gentle.

260
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:35,019
Then finally he came to me.

261
00:14:35,019 --> 00:14:37,019
Do you really love Alex?

262
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:40,059
Or is this all just a game to you, Sophia?

263
00:14:40,059 --> 00:14:41,059
I love him.

264
00:14:41,059 --> 00:14:43,059
Then why do you keep bringing me into it?

265
00:14:43,059 --> 00:14:45,059
Well, I still hate you.

266
00:14:45,059 --> 00:14:47,059
I hate that you stole my life.

267
00:14:47,059 --> 00:14:49,059
I hate that you took Alex from me.

268
00:14:49,059 --> 00:14:52,059
So, seven years ago, I decided to win your life.

269
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:54,059
That night, did you enjoy yourself?

270
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,059
So was you.

271
00:14:55,059 --> 00:15:00,340
All those years ago, it was you behind that night.

272
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,340
Either way, I'm not letting you go again.

273
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:14,259
Come on out.

274
00:15:14,259 --> 00:15:17,259
Well, well, look who it is, the man from seven years ago.

275
00:15:17,259 --> 00:15:19,259
What are you up to, Sophia?

276
00:15:19,259 --> 00:15:21,259
Oh, I know you've been dying to see him.

277
00:15:21,259 --> 00:15:23,259
Isn't this what you wanted?

278
00:15:23,259 --> 00:15:25,610
Do we live that one night?

279
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:26,610
You're insane.

280
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:28,610
Either way, I'm not letting you go.

281
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:29,610
Not again this time.

282
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:33,820
You really don't remember me, do you think?

283
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,820
Let me go.

284
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:40,309
Trying to escape, huh?

285
00:15:40,309 --> 00:15:41,309
I'm doing this for you.

286
00:15:41,309 --> 00:15:44,309
This is who you've been looking for for the past seven years.

287
00:15:44,309 --> 00:15:49,480
What's this?

288
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:56,379
Aren't you afraid of what I think when he finds out about this?

289
00:15:56,379 --> 00:15:58,450
Alex doesn't care about you.

290
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:00,450
Alex never liked you.

291
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:01,450
He wouldn't marry you, Woody.

292
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:03,450
You will never be me.

293
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:08,419
I don't see her, Henry.

294
00:16:08,419 --> 00:16:09,419
She must be inside already.

295
00:16:09,419 --> 00:16:11,419
Okay, notify everybody immediately.

296
00:16:11,419 --> 00:16:12,419
Keep it on the exits.

297
00:16:12,419 --> 00:16:13,940
Here's Emily.

298
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:14,940
She's inside.

299
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:15,940
Let's go.

300
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:22,220
Let's go.

301
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:40,049
What are you doing here?

302
00:16:40,049 --> 00:16:43,840
We can be together.

303
00:16:43,840 --> 00:17:11,559
Seven years ago.

304
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:17,720
Wasn't you the one from seven years ago?

305
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,720
Seven years ago?

306
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,099
She told me to go to that party.

307
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:25,099
She told me to find you and drug you and bring you up to the attic.

308
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:27,359
She wanted me to rape you.

309
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:30,740
I brought you up to the attic, but I couldn't fall through with her commands.

310
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:36,660
Because you resisted.

311
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,660
And then Prince Charming here, he showed up.

312
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:39,660
And he saw what happened.

313
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,660
And he saved the day.

314
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,660
And he actually did for me.

315
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:48,660
Because once I kicked his ass, then I drove him and brought him up to the attic.

316
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:54,660
And once the love drug took its effect, I knew that his confused mind would do the rest of the job for me.

317
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:57,660
So, if it wasn't even...

318
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,750
It was...

319
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:09,670
Yes.

320
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:10,700
Just a scratch.

321
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,700
No, it's not.

322
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,700
We should go to the hospital.

323
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:16,920
Emily, I'm so glad that you're finally here.

324
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,920
And they were back to dinner.

325
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:29,069
Here is Sophia's statement.

326
00:18:29,069 --> 00:18:37,349
Emily went to Sophia because of the man from seven years ago.

327
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:38,349
Yes.

328
00:18:38,349 --> 00:18:39,420
And it's all my fault.

329
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:42,309
And I failed the protector.

330
00:18:42,309 --> 00:18:46,569
Henry, I suggest that you tell her the truth.

331
00:18:46,569 --> 00:18:51,509
Brought you an apple.

332
00:18:51,509 --> 00:18:52,509
Thanks.

333
00:18:52,509 --> 00:18:57,720
So, what's going on with Sophia's case?

334
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,849
Sophia's been arrested.

335
00:18:59,849 --> 00:19:01,140
Court date's been set.

336
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,230
What about the man that was with her?

337
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:05,230
He was injured.

338
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:06,230
He was in the hospital.

339
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,230
Which hospital?

340
00:19:08,299 --> 00:19:09,299
This one.

341
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:11,299
Do you know the room number?

342
00:19:11,299 --> 00:19:12,359
503.

343
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:14,460
What do you care?

344
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,460
I just...

345
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,460
I need to ask him something.

346
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:34,420
I just need a lock of hair.

347
00:19:34,420 --> 00:20:03,039
A surprise.

348
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:05,190
You scared me.

349
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:06,190
Oh my God.

350
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:08,119
I'm so sorry.

351
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:09,119
What are you doing here?

352
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:11,339
I'm the person you're looking for.

353
00:20:11,339 --> 00:20:12,890
What do you mean?

354
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:20,200
Only from seven years ago.

355
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,859
The man you spent that night with.

356
00:20:23,859 --> 00:20:26,750
Asshole!

357
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:30,009
Do you know how hard that seven years has been for me?

358
00:20:30,009 --> 00:20:31,200
For Jack?

359
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,900
Look, it was all my fault.

360
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:38,900
You and Jack have had to endure so much, and I apologize for all of it.

361
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:42,670
You could hit me if it helps, okay?

362
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:45,759
Are you okay?

363
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:48,720
It's just hit the wind.

364
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,980
How long have you known that it's me?

365
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:57,420
I've been searching for a while, but once I found the ring at your place, I knew it was you.

366
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,420
Is that why you asked me to stay?

367
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,420
No.

368
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:02,420
I did that because I'd love it here.

369
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:05,809
I only asked you to stay because of who you are.

370
00:21:05,809 --> 00:21:09,809
I am so lucky to have found you after all of these years.

371
00:21:09,809 --> 00:21:11,809
And I will work every day to make up for you.

372
00:21:11,809 --> 00:21:13,809
In the night week, please.

373
00:21:13,809 --> 00:21:16,279
No, Henry.

374
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:20,460
This is... this is a lot.

375
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,460
I understand.

376
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:25,480
I need someone who's going to be there for me, Henry.

377
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,480
For Jack.

378
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:33,309
And not leave us.

379
00:21:33,309 --> 00:21:35,380
There's no one I'd rather have.

380
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:36,380
Than you.

381
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:38,380
Will you spend the rest of your life with me?

382
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,380
Henry Anderson.
