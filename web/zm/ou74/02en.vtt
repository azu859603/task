00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:03.839
What the hell are you doing?

2
00:00:03.839 --> 00:00:05.839
Whoa, you're home early.

3
00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:07.839
We were just having a little fun.

4
00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:10.839
Don't get worked up. Brad needs somebody who appreciates him.

5
00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:12.839
Appreciate him. I'm his wife.

6
00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:15.839
Yeah, but you never have time for me anymore.

7
00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.000
You're never around.

8
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Mary gets that.

9
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.219
She makes me feel... important.

10
00:00:23.219 --> 00:00:25.420
I mean, look at you.

11
00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.420
You're so focused on your career that you forgot to appreciate your husband.

12
00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.420
What did you expect?

13
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.420
Oh, my God. I did not expect her to be that goddamn stupid.

14
00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.420
How dare you to even know who I am.

15
00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.420
Mary, please let me handle this.

16
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.539
Jade, if you spent a little bit more time...

17
00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:44.579
...being my wife...

18
00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.090
...this wouldn't have happened.

19
00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:48.179
You know what?

20
00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:51.179
I'm the only heiress of the Luca Feller family.

21
00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:55.880
$100,000.

22
00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.320
Leave Brad right now.
