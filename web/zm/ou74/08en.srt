1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,200
Enough, Camilla.

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,459
Leave.

3
00:00:04,459 --> 00:00:05,419
Dominic, she said.

4
00:00:05,419 --> 00:00:12,609
I said, leave.

5
00:00:12,609 --> 00:00:14,679
Are you OK?

6
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:16,839
Why, but who was that?

7
00:00:16,839 --> 00:00:17,760
That's Camilla.

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,320
She is the adopted daughter of the owners.

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,899
She didn't say anything weird, did she?

10
00:00:26,899 --> 00:00:28,579
Maybe a little weird.

11
00:00:28,579 --> 00:00:31,739
Hey, do you want to get some tequila with me?

12
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:45,070
Come on.

13
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:47,079
You're not drinking with me.

14
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:49,280
As a service worker, it's very important

15
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,409
that you please your customer.

16
00:00:53,409 --> 00:01:00,520
I'll do one.

17
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,520
Cheers.

18
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,150
Cheers.

19
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:05,150
No.

20
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:06,150
Go.

21
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:07,150
Yes, yes.

22
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,150
One.

23
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:09,150
One.

24
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:15,530
One.

25
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:20,530
One more shot.

26
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:21,980
Yeah, Mo.

27
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:23,870
Jade.

28
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:26,609
Make us thus come bein'.

29
00:01:26,609 --> 00:01:27,609
Nice.

30
00:01:27,609 --> 00:01:28,609
Mm.

31
00:01:28,609 --> 00:01:39,790
Jilly, pretty handsome.

32
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:40,790
This might take...
