1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.799
This is so good. How do you find the best places?

2
00:00:02.799 --> 00:00:05.839
Well, I took you to the best. This is your vacation, right?

3
00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:09.119
It's really good. Wait, this is so cute!

4
00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:10.240
How about I take a photo of you?

5
00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:13.759
I think this... I don't know. I like this star.

6
00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:15.279
Here. Yeah, let's do it.

7
00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:16.480
Okay. It's fine.

8
00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:34.719
This is the best champagne I've ever had in my life.

9
00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:36.320
I seriously need to think you're out.

10
00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.340
Yeah, that said, eat, pray, and...

11
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.899
Oh, no. Oh, don't remind me. Did I actually see that?

12
00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.619
Well, besides nearly throwing up on me, it was an unforgettable day.

13
00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:53.460
Oh, I'm so sorry. No, I'm not here.

14
00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.659
Hey! A little jerk just stole my bag.

15
00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:02.990
Sit down, Jake. I got this.

16
00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:14.260
See me, yo. It's not most of the rest of the day.

17
00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.459
I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do.

18
00:01:17.459 --> 00:01:18.900
I want it back now.

19
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.810
Who did you just call?

20
00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:27.579
Friend? Now?

21
00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:39.920
Learn some manners, kid.

22
00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.349
You need to explain what on earth is going on here.

23
00:01:54.349 --> 00:01:56.430
How did you get that little punk to come back?

24
00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:03.120
Let's just say I have a fair agreement with the local street kids.

25
00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:23.310
It helps me keep my clients safe.

26
00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.580
The Ramirez Cartel involved in multiple murders.

27
00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.110
Hey, this guy looks familiar.

28
00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.710
The Martinez Cartel.

29
00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:41.789
mobster Garcia recently released from prison.

30
00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:50.979
These people weren't the party last night.

31
00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:52.020
What is this place?

32
00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.599
Hide out from cartel members.

33
00:02:56.159 --> 00:03:01.139
I have to warn Dominic about this.

34
00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.400
It seems you've seen the news.

35
00:03:09.469 --> 00:03:10.909
What are you doing here?

36
00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:12.590
You put these here?

37
00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:15.310
Came in my room without permission.

38
00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.469
I want you to know the truth.

39
00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.669
The parts that Dominic may have never told you.

40
00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:24.210
What is Dominic have to do with this?

41
00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.449
He's not even in any of the pictures.

42
00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:27.169
He's a good girl.

43
00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:30.830
His full name is Dominic Juan Palmer.

44
00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.069
And he's the heir to Ellie's largest Mexican Cartel family.

45
00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:43.330
Dominic? A cartel boss?

46
00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:45.280
Yeah.

47
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.479
Okay.

48
00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.960
Dominic and I grew up together.

49
00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.400
My parents died serving his family.

50
00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.240
So I'm destined to be his wife.

51
00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.569
I don't care what promises he made to you.

52
00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:59.729
You will never marry him.

53
00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:03.039
Wait, what the hell is going on here?

54
00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.659
Dominic is just my escort.

55
00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:07.580
You can't fool me.

56
00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.939
I heard him telling Don Carlos that you are his girlfriend.

57
00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:12.780
Yeah, girlfriend to a mobster?

58
00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:13.419
No, thank you.

59
00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:14.879
I knew it.

60
00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:18.660
Dominic would never be interested in you.

61
00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:23.170
You're so foolish to fall for his lies.

62
00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:24.610
You're not smarter than me.

63
00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.050
You fell for his lies too.

64
00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:27.649
Like your mouth, bitch.

65
00:04:27.649 --> 00:04:31.089
Once a man dropped it right where you're standing.

66
00:04:31.089 --> 00:04:33.279
And I'm sure you don't want to be the next.

67
00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:33.759
Do you?

68
00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.490
Okay.

69
00:04:38.959 --> 00:04:42.879
Let's uh, let's not complicate this.

70
00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.360
I'm just a tourist.

71
00:04:47.019 --> 00:04:48.720
I can think things.

72
00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.399
And I will be out of here right today.

73
00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.230
To see me.

74
00:04:55.230 --> 00:05:18.720
I'm sorry, did you say grandfather?

75
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.279
Yeah, I've never met him before, so.

76
00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:22.879
It doesn't matter.

77
00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:24.480
He died three days ago.

78
00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:26.399
And left behind a large inheritance.

79
00:05:26.399 --> 00:05:26.720
What?

80
00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:28.670
What inheritance?

81
00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:43.839
Oh my god.

82
00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:46.689
Hello?

83
00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:49.410
Yeah, yeah, you said your name was Elise, right?

84
00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:52.370
Hey, have you heard of the Palmer family, the Mexican cartel?

85
00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:56.449
I just got done dealing with this nightmare, so I'm not a...

86
00:05:56.449 --> 00:06:04.610
What?

87
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:05.490
The thief.

88
00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:08.029
I made quite an impression on you, huh?

89
00:06:10.339 --> 00:06:14.459
Listen, if this is about money, I can give you all I have.

90
00:06:14.459 --> 00:06:15.259
You don't need...

91
00:06:15.259 --> 00:06:17.660
Ah, nobody wants your money.

92
00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:18.939
And you're the...

93
00:06:18.939 --> 00:06:24.910
Is that Dominic Foreman?

94
00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:25.949
Absolutely.

95
00:06:25.949 --> 00:06:30.180
Is that Dominic Foreman?

96
00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:31.550
Absolutely.

97
00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:33.949
He told me himself, he really likes his girl.

98
00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:36.930
He did?

99
00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:37.730
When?

100
00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:41.009
So, you don't speak Spanish?

101
00:06:42.079 --> 00:06:45.360
So, when I return your bag, he said he really likes you.

102
00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.319
Like, a lot.

103
00:06:47.459 --> 00:06:48.579
What are you doing?

104
00:06:48.579 --> 00:06:50.259
Your job is to kidnap her.

105
00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:52.100
Not to be chatting with her.

106
00:06:58.610 --> 00:06:59.250
Shut up, kid.

107
00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:06.350
It's me, Marco.

108
00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:08.500
I have you, pretty girl.

109
00:07:09.579 --> 00:07:10.699
Say hello to your boyfriend.

110
00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:12.800
Dominic?

111
00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:15.839
Dominic?

112
00:07:15.839 --> 00:07:17.300
Jade, are you all right?

113
00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:17.939
Did they hurt you?

114
00:07:18.579 --> 00:07:19.300
Do you look at that?

115
00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:20.819
The liar cares if I'm okay.

116
00:07:21.459 --> 00:07:22.420
Listen, Dominic.

117
00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:24.500
No one's harmed her yet.

118
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:26.980
Whether she gets hurt, or that depends on you.

119
00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:28.420
Where do you want Marco?

120
00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:30.500
If you even lay a finger on her out.

121
00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:33.939
I want you here, alone, within one hour.

122
00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:39.139
And if not, I will kill your pretty girl.

123
00:07:40.459 --> 00:07:44.259
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, seriously?

124
00:07:44.259 --> 00:07:46.740
I'm your hostage, so if you do that.

125
00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:48.589
Shut up!

126
00:07:55.980 --> 00:08:00.980
Listen, this is all just one big mistake, okay?

127
00:08:01.939 --> 00:08:05.779
I'm just a tourist, and I'm just here on a fun little trip to LA.

128
00:08:05.779 --> 00:08:09.139
Dominic tricked me into thinking that he was my escort.

129
00:08:09.139 --> 00:08:12.660
And then he brings me to his family and introduces me as his girlfriend.

130
00:08:13.459 --> 00:08:16.420
So, yeah, it really is just one big misunderstanding.

131
00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:21.410
Dominic Palmer is an escort.

132
00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:23.819
That is the funniest thing I've heard.

133
00:08:26.209 --> 00:08:28.290
Now I see what Dominic really likes you, girl.

134
00:08:29.629 --> 00:08:30.990
I am not just a girl.

135
00:08:32.299 --> 00:08:35.019
I'm the mafia boss, Michael Morris, his granddaughter.

136
00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:41.169
And I'm gonna make you pay.

137
00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:44.529
Are you really Michael's granddaughter?

138
00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:46.460
Oh, no.

139
00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:50.769
That fear in your eyes lets me know that you have nothing from that old man.

140
00:08:51.649 --> 00:08:58.320
Chick, where is your boyfriend?

141
00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:01.789
I guess we need to send him a little reminder, don't we?

142
00:09:03.779 --> 00:09:06.659
Why don't you tell your boyfriend if he can come over here,

143
00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:09.299
and we can go ahead and chat it up.

144
00:09:09.299 --> 00:09:10.500
Why don't you tell me yourself?

145
00:09:11.549 --> 00:09:12.509
Dominic!

146
00:09:12.509 --> 00:09:13.389
Get him!

147
00:09:17.519 --> 00:09:18.320
Not so fast.

148
00:09:19.039 --> 00:09:21.279
This little cutie will blow us all to pieces.

149
00:09:21.279 --> 00:09:22.080
What the fuck?

150
00:09:23.789 --> 00:09:26.899
Are you all right?

151
00:09:26.899 --> 00:09:29.220
You weren't stupid enough to come here alone, were you?

152
00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:30.340
I didn't have a choice.

153
00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:31.460
You're a friend to kill you.

154
00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:34.980
So your brilliant rescue plan is to come here, blow us all up, and hope we survive.

155
00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:36.179
I'm saving you, Princess.

156
00:09:36.899 --> 00:09:38.419
Will you acknowledge me with me, nice?

157
00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:42.850
Lying to me about being a mobster, thank you.

158
00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:45.250
I'm sorry we can talk about that later.

159
00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:46.690
I've sent Miguel to gather my men.

160
00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:49.970
I couldn't imagine that earlier.

161
00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:52.049
Like people are all-

162
00:09:52.049 --> 00:09:54.049
Hey, hey, you two stop flirting in front of me!

163
00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:01.419
You fake you idiot!

164
00:10:05.179 --> 00:10:07.019
You really think I'm stupid, Dominic?

165
00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:09.179
Tommy, tie him up.

166
00:10:09.179 --> 00:10:10.220
Tie him up!

167
00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:13.470
That's what?

168
00:10:13.629 --> 00:10:15.389
You're so weak now you gotta rely on a gun.

169
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.440
No, I prefer to be gentle with the ladies.

170
00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:30.500
Now we're gonna see how much he actually cares about you.

171
00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:31.059
Fuck you!

172
00:10:34.029 --> 00:10:34.830
You're a lucky girl.

173
00:10:35.759 --> 00:10:39.980
Most people don't get to meet my big guy now.

174
00:10:46.139 --> 00:10:47.820
Or I'll shoot you first.

175
00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:48.830
Gotta be kidding me!

176
00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:51.009
Who the hell are you?

177
00:10:51.889 --> 00:10:53.250
Another cartel?

178
00:10:53.250 --> 00:11:02.370
I may have said this a lot today, but I'm not this guy's girlfriend

179
00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:04.529
and I'm definitely not part of any cartel.

180
00:11:04.529 --> 00:11:05.889
You will be, Jade.

181
00:11:05.889 --> 00:11:09.330
Because I'll make sure you inherit your grandfather's mafia business.

182
00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:09.649
What?

183
00:11:11.019 --> 00:11:11.740
You-

184
00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:13.179
Yes, Ms. Morris.

185
00:11:13.179 --> 00:11:14.700
I'm Elise, we spoke on the phone.

186
00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:18.049
Ms. Morris isn't even my name.

187
00:11:18.049 --> 00:11:18.690
It is now.

188
00:11:19.789 --> 00:11:22.110
Your grandfather left you his empire.

189
00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:24.830
I'm here to make sure you inherit it.

190
00:11:27.889 --> 00:11:29.889
Okay, can you please tell me what's going on here?

191
00:11:31.259 --> 00:11:38.379
Jade Morris is the granddaughter of Michael Morris, the mafia boss, and his soul heir.

192
00:11:38.379 --> 00:11:41.100
I don't know any mafia grandfather.

193
00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:44.059
And one importantly, can we please untie me so that we can talk about this?

194
00:11:47.779 --> 00:11:52.740
Don Michael may not have been involved in your life, but he kept your photos all this time.

195
00:11:59.259 --> 00:12:02.049
So this is all real.

196
00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:05.009
Don't fall for it, Jade. They can't be trusted.

197
00:12:12.669 --> 00:12:16.110
You're the last person I should trust, Dominic Juan Palmer.

198
00:12:17.779 --> 00:12:19.539
Your lies almost had me killed.

199
00:12:20.179 --> 00:12:22.340
Jane, what do you want me to do with him?

200
00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:31.100
I can make him pay for deceiving you once.

201
00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:38.139
He may have lied, but he came as fast as he could to save me, so just let him go.

202
00:12:38.139 --> 00:12:40.899
You heard the boss release him.

203
00:12:41.539 --> 00:12:47.340
Sorry.

204
00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:49.259
Your apology means nothing.

205
00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:55.059
Don't ever show your face in front of Ms. Morris again.

206
00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:57.179
Let's go.

207
00:13:11.759 --> 00:13:17.659
So my grandfather's death wasn't an accident, but a planned assassination.

208
00:13:18.299 --> 00:13:21.899
Our main suspect is Marco Sanchez, the guy who kidnapped you.

209
00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:24.139
He used to work for Don Michael.

210
00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:30.139
However, we cannot entirely rule out the Palmer family either.

211
00:13:31.039 --> 00:13:32.159
Dominic's family?

212
00:13:33.299 --> 00:13:36.019
No, that's impossible. There's no way.

213
00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:41.139
I've met Carlos. I mean, they just don't seem like the type of people

214
00:13:41.139 --> 00:13:43.220
that would commit such a dishonorable crime.

215
00:14:00.259 --> 00:14:07.580
Signor, a true Mexican man always goes after the woman that he likes.

216
00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:11.090
That's what you told me, Signor.

217
00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:13.009
She'll never forgive me for lying.

218
00:14:13.009 --> 00:14:14.659
But you can always go after her.

219
00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:16.990
I mean, leave it up to God.

220
00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:18.590
That's what we do with the cartel, isn't it?

221
00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:21.169
Whatever you do, you better do it fast.

222
00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:23.600
Don Carlos keeps asking me.

223
00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:25.549
Why is your girl missing?

224
00:14:25.549 --> 00:14:47.220
I have to go somewhere.

225
00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:56.580
What did you want?

226
00:14:56.580 --> 00:15:01.889
Jade, well, I guess I owe you a proper apology.

227
00:15:03.149 --> 00:15:10.539
Like I said, you were the first one that came to rescue me, so we're even now.

228
00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:14.559
Wait, wait. There's something else.

229
00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:17.820
I want something back from you.

230
00:15:19.279 --> 00:15:23.840
You're not about to say something cliche, like, you still have my heart, are you?

231
00:15:24.909 --> 00:15:25.710
What's wrong with that?

232
00:15:26.269 --> 00:15:28.590
You saw how I lost my mind over you.

233
00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:31.870
If my dad knew I grabbed a bomb model and just walked on a Marcos turf,

234
00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:34.350
I'm pretty sure he'd regret making me his air.

235
00:15:35.309 --> 00:15:37.950
So reckless of you, what were you thinking?

236
00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:39.149
I don't remember.

237
00:15:39.149 --> 00:15:47.309
I heard your voice, my heart, son of Tremblay.

238
00:15:47.309 --> 00:15:50.190
Jade, if you got hurt that day, I wouldn't be able to forgive myself.

239
00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:04.110
Perfect timing, it is.

240
00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:07.539
You really could use a drink.

241
00:16:12.769 --> 00:16:13.570
How is it?

242
00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:15.679
It worked the trip.

243
00:16:16.769 --> 00:16:20.830
Speaking of the trip, do you remember the end?

244
00:16:23.419 --> 00:16:24.299
Why are you asking?

245
00:16:24.299 --> 00:16:24.539
Wow.

246
00:16:25.419 --> 00:16:27.019
We've already done the first two things.

247
00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:54.980
Time is it.

248
00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:58.049
Who cares with you here?

249
00:16:58.049 --> 00:17:03.039
I could stay like this forever.

250
00:17:03.039 --> 00:17:15.039
I know, but I've got more important things to worry about, like, who murdered my grandfather.

251
00:17:15.039 --> 00:17:19.359
Wait, Michael Morris was a murder?

252
00:17:19.359 --> 00:17:24.140
Doesn't seem like it was a natural death.

253
00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:27.869
Who's your suspect, Marco?

254
00:17:27.869 --> 00:17:32.500
This would be his best move to take over the east.

255
00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:35.650
Yeah, you're on the same page as us.

256
00:17:40.559 --> 00:17:46.559
By the way, do you think you could teach me how to be a mom boss?

257
00:17:48.299 --> 00:17:50.299
Elise kind of scares me a little.

258
00:17:52.609 --> 00:18:02.029
She scares me too, but another round.

259
00:18:02.029 --> 00:18:14.029
What about now?

260
00:18:14.029 --> 00:18:14.589
Put these on.

261
00:18:20.539 --> 00:18:24.380
Now you finish the first step of becoming a mafia boss.

262
00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:26.220
Step one is putting on sunglasses.

263
00:18:28.769 --> 00:18:29.250
You'll see.

264
00:18:30.259 --> 00:18:34.660
Being a mafia boss isn't just about looks, it's about attitude.

265
00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:39.180
The second step to becoming a mob boss is learning how to manage your people.

266
00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:39.660
Okay.

267
00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:42.619
Now let me ask you, Jay, what would you do if your people messed up?

268
00:18:43.259 --> 00:18:46.059
Um, doctor salary.

269
00:18:47.839 --> 00:18:48.640
Tough enough, Jay.

270
00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:52.609
Okay, um, hmm, all right, all right, all right.

271
00:18:54.609 --> 00:18:56.130
Slap them a little.

272
00:18:56.769 --> 00:18:59.490
Does that, no, that's aggressive, isn't it?

273
00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:00.369
Let's start small.

274
00:19:01.619 --> 00:19:03.710
Slap him, party.

275
00:19:19.299 --> 00:19:19.940
I'm sorry.

276
00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:21.539
Let me go, are you okay?

277
00:19:26.589 --> 00:19:29.069
That's how you do it, ma'am, according to the boss.

278
00:19:29.069 --> 00:19:39.619
I'm really going to officially meet your parents today.

279
00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:42.140
I'm still so nervous.

280
00:19:43.019 --> 00:19:43.500
Don't be.

281
00:19:44.319 --> 00:19:45.680
They already like you playing.

282
00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:47.839
Hey boss, there's someone here who's seen his mourns,

283
00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:49.920
and he's claiming to be her husband.

284
00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:51.359
Brad?

285
00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:52.480
What?

286
00:19:53.119 --> 00:20:02.180
Damn it, jade scott, you're my wife.

287
00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:04.339
How can you be messing around with another man?

288
00:20:04.339 --> 00:20:04.980
Shame on you.

289
00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:06.259
Go ahead, say it again.

290
00:20:06.259 --> 00:20:09.710
Do not call me jade scott anymore.

291
00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:11.069
I'm divorcing you.

292
00:20:11.069 --> 00:20:11.470
Brad.

293
00:20:12.190 --> 00:20:13.789
You can have your last name back.

294
00:20:13.789 --> 00:20:21.539
Oh, and yeah, can have this back too.

295
00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:31.089
Hey, I heard you inherited a massive empire in LA.
