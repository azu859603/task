1
00:00:01,139 --> 00:00:04,139
I heard you inherited a massive empire in L.A.

2
00:00:04,139 --> 00:00:06,839
So you're rich now, you're coming home with me.

3
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:08,140
Oh, don't shoot me.

4
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,140
I'll fucking kill you.

5
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:10,619
Let me handle it.

6
00:00:10,619 --> 00:00:11,619
Dominic.

7
00:00:11,619 --> 00:00:14,619
Look, Jade, as soon as you left, I cut things off with Mary.

8
00:00:14,619 --> 00:00:16,640
I swear.

9
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,640
Is that because she finally got sick of being your caretaker?

10
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,640
Jade, please come home.

11
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,640
I miss your apple pies.

12
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,730
That's why you want to get back together with me, Brad.

13
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:30,730
Because you need a maid to cook for you?

14
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:33,020
I have to be so aggressive.

15
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:36,020
You're my wife. It's your job to cook for me.

16
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:37,210
Hmm.

17
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:38,780
Actually...

18
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:39,780
Ugh!

19
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,979
That's my duty.
