00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.240
I can do anything to make you disappear from Dominique's life.

2
00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:12.460
Camilla, did you know that I'm mafia now too?

3
00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.480
If you dare hurt me,

4
00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.510
Elise and her team will not let you get away with it.

5
00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:20.510
We'll see about that.

6
00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.519
I gotta go.

7
00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:28.449
But don't say I didn't warn you

8
00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:35.000
if Dominique finally gets sick of your games.

9
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I'll destroy you bitch.

10
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.020
I wasn't expecting your call.

11
00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.020
Just like I wasn't expecting,

12
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.020
Michael Morris' granddaughter to be staying at the former house.

13
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.250
Tell me about it.

14
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.950
What about you?

15
00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.049
Michael's mafia business should have been yours.

16
00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:57.460
Aren't you gels about it?

17
00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.460
What are you getting at?

18
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.560
I wanna help you, Michael.

19
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.140
In return.

20
00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.810
I want her dead.
