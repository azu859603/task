1
00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.040
I want her dead.

2
00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.040
No one can touch Jade Morris now.

3
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.490
She's got the Morris gang and the Palmer family behind her. You know that.

4
00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.160
I know Elise is hunting you for Michael's death.

5
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.160
Do you really want to spend the rest of your days on the run?

6
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.160
Just think about it. If Dominic and Jade stay together.

7
00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.160
You won't belong before the Palmer family joins the hunt.

8
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.539
So what are you suggesting?

9
00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.020
You kill Jade and her men.

10
00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.020
And I'll give you insider information on the Palmer family.

11
00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.020
As long as you spare Dominic.

12
00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.539
You can deal with the rest however you want.

13
00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:46.859
Aren't you afraid that Dominic's gonna hate you for this?

14
00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:48.859
You know how much the mob just spices rats.

15
00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:52.859
I'd rather risk his hatred than watching love another woman.

16
00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:56.020
What do you say? Ready to collaborate?

17
00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.320
Why not?

18
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.479
Good. I'll send you the information later on.

19
00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:09.510
You crazy stupid woman.

20
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.510
Dominic is my biggest enemy.

21
00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.930
There's no way I'll let him live.
