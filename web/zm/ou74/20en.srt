1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:10,240
Stop worrying, baby.

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,500
Everything's going to be fine.

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,519
What if our plan doesn't work?

4
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:16,519
What if Marco escapes?

5
00:00:16,519 --> 00:00:18,519
Let's stop worrying about Marco.

6
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:22,699
Have you thought about tonight?

7
00:00:22,699 --> 00:00:24,890
Do you know what dress you're going to wear for our date?

8
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:30,780
Why is there something special about tonight?

9
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,000
No.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,320
No, no.

11
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:37,320
Yeah, I just thought maybe it would help you take your mind off things.

12
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,210
Yeah.

13
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:41,270
Yeah, you're right.

14
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:44,270
I should just focus on our date.

15
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:51,259
Miguel.

16
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:54,920
Where's Dominic?

17
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,399
Why isn't he here yet?

18
00:00:57,399 --> 00:00:59,659
Uh, no, the boss is running late.

19
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:01,659
He just had some things he had to take care of.

20
00:01:01,659 --> 00:01:10,349
Have you noticed how empty the place is?

21
00:01:10,349 --> 00:01:13,060
We're the only ones here.

22
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:15,790
Something's off, maybe we should go.

23
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:17,790
No, Madam.

24
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,790
Would you like to try tonight's special?
