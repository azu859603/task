1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Any last words, Dominic?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,780
Of course.

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:23,870
Ching-gutu-majare.

4
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:25,629
Is that all you've got?

5
00:00:25,629 --> 00:00:28,179
Your father was way tougher than you.

6
00:00:28,179 --> 00:00:30,780
You don't get to mention my father's name, you bastard!

7
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:33,789
So you still remember the old man?

8
00:00:33,789 --> 00:00:43,820
I thought she would have forgot after working as Michael Morris's lapdog for so long.

9
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:48,689
I'm never going to forget how your family destroyed my family.

10
00:00:48,689 --> 00:00:53,969
But soon enough, the pilot family will go down, just like you.

11
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:58,899
You lay a finger on her, I'll make sure you end up in pieces.

12
00:00:58,899 --> 00:00:59,899
Check the back.

13
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:01,500
The gun must have ran through the back.

14
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,500
Bring it on.

15
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,500
Right, sir.
