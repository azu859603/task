00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.730
You harmed Jade, Elise and her men won't let you get away with it.

2
00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:07.379
Elise, isn't she miles away to the north?

3
00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:08.580
How do you?

4
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.820
Who gave me that information, Dominic?

5
00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:11.820
Think about it.

6
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.089
I can remember.

7
00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:14.089
You threatened her.

8
00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:16.289
Oh, no. She called me first.

9
00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.730
And now my men are on their way to wipe up every one of your men.

10
00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.730
And Elise, I set up an ambush.

11
00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.570
Yeah, I should be wiped out soon enough.

12
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:25.570
You filthy cow!

13
00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.370
No, you see, that's why I survived.

14
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:33.710
Tonight, Marco Sanchez will rise as Elise Vegas mob boss.

15
00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.750
And Dominic, you should have married that woman.

16
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.719
She's the most ruthless, vicious person that I've ever met.

17
00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:42.960
Sorry. Are you talking about me?
