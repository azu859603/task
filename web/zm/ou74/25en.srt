1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,279
Sorry. Are you talking about me?

2
00:00:02,279 --> 00:00:03,680
Morris J!

3
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:06,639
What the hell? How are you here?

4
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:09,160
Neliz, you're supposed to be dead.

5
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,320
J, it's been monitoring Camilla for some time now.

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,980
We know all of your schemes.

7
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:17,260
What?

8
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:19,260
You treacherous witch!

9
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,589
Let me go!

10
00:00:21,589 --> 00:00:23,629
It's funny.

11
00:00:23,629 --> 00:00:27,539
You used to warn me about the mob life, but...

12
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:29,339
It looks like you're the one that lost the game.

13
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:31,899
I didn't lose a bitch.

14
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:34,460
I am a member of the Department of Family.

15
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:36,770
Not anymore, Camilla.

16
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:40,619
Dominic, your father adopted me.

17
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:45,350
The Palmer family will never tolerate a traitor in your exile.
