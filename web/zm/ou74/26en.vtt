00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.259
You're exiled.

2
00:00:02.259 --> 00:00:06.160
No, no, no minute, please, please forgive me.

3
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.160
I didn't want to lose you.

4
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.509
Won't you ever get it?

5
00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:13.330
I'm the one that's in charge here.

6
00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.859
Elise, get her out of here.

7
00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:16.859
Yes, boss?

8
00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.449
No, no, no, let me go, no!

9
00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.449
One traitor down, one more to go.

10
00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:31.890
Marco Sanchez, you're being accused of the murder of your former boss,

11
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.890
Michael Morris. Do you have any last words?

12
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.479
Yes, Michael never saw me as one of his men.

13
00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:39.479
Even Elise had a more power than I did.

14
00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:42.479
That's because Don Michael treated you as his heir.

15
00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:45.479
He was tough on you to sharpen your will.

16
00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:46.479
His heir?

17
00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:48.979
Nah, that man only wanted to control me.

18
00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:51.520
He never trusted me with anything important.

19
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.020
And now with Ami by his side, he left a clueless woman

20
00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.020
to run the whole thing. How pathetic.

21
00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.020
At least I didn't betray my entire family the way that you did.

22
00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.430
You broke the trust that my grandfather had in you.

23
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.430
The trust? I don't even think you know what that word means.

24
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.430
Stop wasting her time.

25
00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.430
Someone's going to die, let's do it now.

26
00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.620
I will do that.

27
00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.769
But first, I think it's time for you to face the truth.

28
00:01:19.769 --> 00:01:21.769
Elise, get the tapes.
