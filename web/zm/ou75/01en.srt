1
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:18,199
So, sir, are you coming back?

2
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:23,870
Why don't you go take care of Rodney and get back to work?

3
00:00:23,870 --> 00:01:00,380
Three days ago, urgently, keep the shareholders be.

4
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:05,500
I know you've been pressing your shareholders.

5
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,980
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

6
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:10,329
I mean, I'm glad you know.

7
00:01:10,329 --> 00:01:12,689
You see, soon your fathers will be publicized.

8
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:15,569
And when that happens, I'm going to offer you double

9
00:01:15,569 --> 00:01:19,040
to buy 15% of the company's shares.

10
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,640
And what if I refuse?

11
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,549
I am doing this for the sake of the Vanderbilt group.

12
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,540
After all, we can't have a blind person

13
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:33,840
like you managing it, can we?

14
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,799
Soon enough, you will know who owns the Vanderbilt group.

15
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,549
And tell me, who do you think that's going to be?

16
00:01:40,549 --> 00:01:43,500
You really think a bastard like you can own the company.

17
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,500
You know, whether you're doing this

18
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:49,069
for the Vanderbilt group or yourself, I don't really care.

19
00:01:49,069 --> 00:01:51,230
I think it's best you stay where you are.

20
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:52,189
End of discussion.
