00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:06.740
Dad?

2
00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:19.120
Hey, I'm sorry about tonight.

3
00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.519
I should, uh, reintroduce myself.

4
00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:23.820
I'm Liam.

5
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.489
What are you doing here?

6
00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:32.689
Well, you've had a fever since we've gone back,

7
00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.130
and you're still burning.

8
00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:44.299
I don't need a bodyguard.

9
00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:45.299
Emma.

10
00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:46.840
Ms. Vanderbilt.

11
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.579
Ms. Vanderbilt.

12
00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:50.579
I'm afraid you don't really have a choice.

13
00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.820
Your father hired me to be your bodyguard

14
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.219
as you regain your vision.

15
00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:55.979
And I'm just supposed to believe you,

16
00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:57.420
because of that tape.

17
00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:12.609
Please.

18
00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:13.530
It was just for show.

19
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.450
Why did you have to get hurt like that?

20
00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:17.650
Well, how are they going to believe it

21
00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.859
if I'm not actually hurt?

22
00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:22.530
Also, didn't I tell you not to come into my room?

23
00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.730
She can't see anything.

24
00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:26.810
Besides your hurt, I have the right to check on you

25
00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:27.650
as her stepmother.

26
00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.900
Right, but she can hear.

27
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.340
We have to be very careful at this critical moment.

28
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.140
I don't care what you do after,

29
00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.129
but I want those shares from Emma.

30
00:01:39.129 --> 00:01:41.590
I'll take care of this myself.

31
00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.340
You go check on her.

32
00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:47.780
Hey, Emma.

33
00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.349
Daniel, are you OK?

34
00:01:51.349 --> 00:01:53.280
You OK?

35
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.319
Yeah, I'm all right.

36
00:01:54.319 --> 00:02:03.640
Let's have a seat.

37
00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.400
How are you feeling?

38
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.080
Epeline, what are you doing here?
