00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.320
Evelyn was just bringing me some medical supplies.

2
00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.509
Are you hurt? What happened?

3
00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:10.820
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm okay.

4
00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.820
But you. You're sick. You need some rest.

5
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.690
Daniel, I need you to call the police.

6
00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.940
Call the police. Why?

7
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.940
I don't think my father had a heart attack.

8
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:29.870
En la. I know you've been having a very hard time accepting your father's death,

9
00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:33.869
but the doctors did conclude that he died of a heart attack.

10
00:00:33.869 --> 00:00:38.579
I really think there's more to this story, and I have to trust my God.

11
00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.579
I really think that Uncle Ethan had something to do with this.

12
00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:46.829
Your priority right now is to get back your eyesight.

13
00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.729
So you need to be taking your meds and you need plenty of rest. I'll look into it.

14
00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:57.420
Come on, let's take you to Rambo.

15
00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.420
Good night, Evelyn. Good night.
