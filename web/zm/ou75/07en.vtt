00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.879
Are you okay?

2
00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:07.469
You know what? You're gonna need a carburetor for that.

3
00:00:07.469 --> 00:00:09.730
Let me go get one for you.

4
00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:41.640
Thank you.

5
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.640
Intro to the volume, please.

6
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.659
Trying to, but there just seems to be no audio.

7
00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:51.700
What do you see?

8
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:58.810
Mr. Vanderbilt was alone in this room on that day.

9
00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:59.810
Are you sure?

10
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:01.509
Yeah.

11
00:01:01.509 --> 00:01:04.250
It seems to me like you did die of a heart attack.

12
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.250
Did you check the other security cameras mean media?

13
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:08.500
The one by the stairwell?

14
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.500
I checked all the cameras.

15
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.500
Except the one in the study.

16
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.500
But I didn't find anything.

17
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:47.930
Is there any more footage I don't know about?

18
00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.930
We saw the footage, didn't we?

19
00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.930
I erased everything that needed to be erased.

20
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:52.930
Do you know this?

21
00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:53.930
No, I just...

22
00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.930
What? Do you not believe me?
