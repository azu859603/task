1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Do you not trust me?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,500
I deleted the part where your guy changed the will and made Robin.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,000
I don't care. Just be a good girl and give me that card.

4
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:19,000
Fine. I know you don't trust me.

5
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:27,989
Of course I trust you.

6
00:00:27,989 --> 00:00:30,500
Come on.

7
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:36,229
I know you've been through so much this past half year, marrying that old man.

8
00:00:36,229 --> 00:00:38,229
Shit, that was torture for me too.

9
00:00:38,229 --> 00:00:41,899
Thank God he's dead, right?

10
00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:45,780
Let's please leave when we get the money.

11
00:00:45,780 --> 00:01:08,840
Oh, good evening Mrs. Vanderbilt.

12
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:13,340
Who are you?

13
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,340
You don't look like someone who just lost your husband.

14
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:19,099
You must be Emma's new body card.

15
00:01:19,099 --> 00:01:22,140
Your only responsibility is to take care of her.

16
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,140
Your insulin may cost you your job.

17
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:51,189
Did you find her?

18
00:01:51,189 --> 00:01:53,189
Looks like you got in some good fight today.

19
00:01:53,189 --> 00:02:02,620
Did you get the materials?

20
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:05,129
No. Someone else got them.
