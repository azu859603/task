1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,399
I mean someone opened the safe after Rodney Day?

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:03,899
It looks like it.

3
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:05,500
It's getting interesting.

4
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:09,929
The person who also opened the safe is the one who killed Rodney?

5
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:11,929
Where you going?

6
00:00:11,929 --> 00:00:13,929
One of the Vanderbilt House.

7
00:00:13,929 --> 00:00:16,929
Watch out for Rodney's daughter. She's a piece of work.

8
00:00:16,929 --> 00:00:17,960
Be careful.

9
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:45,619
Good morning, Ms. Vanderbilt.

10
00:00:45,619 --> 00:00:48,799
I told you yesterday I don't need a bodyguard.

11
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:51,299
You know your situation, more than I do.

12
00:00:51,299 --> 00:01:33,670
Ms. Vanderbilt, I think you should at least let me protect you until you gain your sight back.

13
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:42,170
Please come have a seat.

14
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:43,519
How did you sleep?

15
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:44,519
Very well actually.

16
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:46,650
Is Daniel here?

17
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,650
He went to work very early this morning.

18
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:51,189
When will he be back?

19
00:01:51,189 --> 00:01:52,189
Later today.

20
00:01:52,189 --> 00:01:54,189
It's probably very busy.

21
00:01:54,189 --> 00:01:56,540
I made you your favorite coffee.

22
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:58,500
Thank you.

23
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,870
It's very hot.

24
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,870
Let me cool down for you a little bit.

25
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:10,099
Thank you, Larry.

26
00:02:10,099 --> 00:02:11,129
Hello.

27
00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:12,129
Ms. Vanderbilt.

28
00:02:12,129 --> 00:02:13,129
Nate?

29
00:02:13,129 --> 00:02:16,129
I've got some information about Mr. Vanderbilt that you may want to know.
