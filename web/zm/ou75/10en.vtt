00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:09.220
Nate? Okay, where are you?

2
00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:13.429
Okay, I'm on my way.

3
00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:17.100
That was my father's assistant.

4
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.420
He disappeared right after my dad's death,

5
00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.420
but he just said he has information for me.

6
00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.420
You're gonna go find him? I mean, you can't.

7
00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.699
It's okay. I have Liam. I'll be okay.

8
00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:44.219
Daniel, Rodney's assistant just called Emma

9
00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.219
and told her he would tell her what happened that night,

10
00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:48.219
and now she's on her way to go find him.

11
00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:55.090
I can do it myself.

12
00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.469
I'm like temporarily blind.

13
00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:01.000
Oh!

14
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.390
Are you okay?

15
00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.879
Yeah, all right.

16
00:01:09.879 --> 00:01:10.879
What are you doing?

17
00:01:10.879 --> 00:01:14.379
I'm gonna fasten your seatbelt.

18
00:01:14.379 --> 00:01:22.060
Are you acting so nervous? It's not like I'm into you

19
00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.060
or anything with this Vanderbilt.

20
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.060
Right, sorry.

21
00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:43.859
All right, go check it out first.

22
00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:44.859
Stay in the car.
