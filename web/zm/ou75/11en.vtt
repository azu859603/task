1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:28.649
What are you?

2
00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:29.649
It doesn't matter who we are.

3
00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:30.649
You think you can survive us?

4
00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:31.649
What are you doing?

5
00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:46.990
You'll feel on sale just some money.

6
00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.250
I'm gonna use this to pay us back.

7
00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:50.250
What does he owe you?

8
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.460
I can pay.

9
00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.320
I can just tell me how much and I will help.

10
00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.100
Must have kind of fooled you.

11
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.030
Why not I equal the police?

12
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.030
What do you want?

13
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.030
No one I want.

14
00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:08.030
Don't touch me.

15
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.609
Don't touch me.

16
00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:10.609
Don't touch me.

17
00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:11.799
Don't touch me.

18
00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:12.799
Don't touch me.

19
00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:13.799
Don't touch me.

20
00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.379
Don't touch me.

21
00:01:15.379 --> 00:01:16.379
Don't touch me.

22
00:01:16.379 --> 00:01:17.379
Don't touch me.

23
00:01:17.379 --> 00:01:18.379
Don't touch me.

24
00:01:18.379 --> 00:01:56.959
Don't touch me.

25
00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.780
George, I think we can set up that transfer now.

26
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:14.240
Emma!

27
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.229
She's heart.

28
00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:18.479
Who did that?

29
00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:19.479
Daniel?

30
00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:20.479
They said you owe them money.

31
00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:21.479
No, no.

32
00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:22.479
No way.

33
00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:23.479
Maybe it was Ethan.

34
00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:24.479
Can you find out?

35
00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:28.370
Come on.

36
00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:39.590
Why don't you go take care of Robin?

37
00:02:39.590 --> 00:03:01.939
Then get back to me.

38
00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:02.939
You can live here for No One.

39
00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:07.620
How do you feel?

40
00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:08.780
I'm a little spooked.

41
00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.490
But I'll be okay.

42
00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:32.780
I'm sorry they hurt you.

43
00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:40.120
Your father hired me to protect you.

44
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:58.419
The people from the funeral parlor are here to see you.

45
00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:01.419
Okay, wonderful. Um, lead them to the living room, please.

46
00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:02.419
Okay.

47
00:04:02.419 --> 00:04:04.610
Oh, and you grabbed Daniel and Evelyn.

48
00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:06.610
And lay out my suit.

49
00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:07.610
Sure.

50
00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:17.000
Excuse me for disturbing you, Miss Vanderbilt,

51
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
but I need to speak to you about your father's funeral.

52
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.540
Please check to see what we have planned so far.

53
00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:28.540
And I am very sorry for your loss, Miss Vanderbilt.

54
00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.819
That's okay.

55
00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:35.220
But my father's funeral can wait.

56
00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:46.720
I'd like to order an autopsy.

57
00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:52.720
Miss Vanderbilt, permission from the relating authorities is required if you want an autopsy done in your father's body.

58
00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.720
That's okay. Well, you help me with my application process.

59
00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:56.850
Sure.

60
00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:00.000
I'll be in touch if anything comes up.

61
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:07.819
Excuse me.

62
00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:11.810
Emma, why didn't you tell me you wanted to do that?

63
00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.810
You know that I never believed my father had a heart attack.

64
00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:16.810
You should have come to me first.

65
00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:18.810
Rodney was my husband, after all.

66
00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:20.810
And you were married six months.

67
00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:27.540
If you love him, at all like I do, you'll understand why I have to do this.

68
00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:45.610
Actually does this autopsy.

69
00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:46.610
And I'll let her do it.

70
00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:58.810
Okay, some help.

71
00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:03.850
Miss Vanderbilt, you want to get out of class with one?

72
00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:06.319
Sure.

73
00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:07.509
Yeah?

74
00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:19.579
Miss Vanderbilt.

75
00:06:19.579 --> 00:06:46.699
Slow down.

76
00:06:46.699 --> 00:06:51.459
Liam, do you think there's anybody around me I can trust?

77
00:06:51.459 --> 00:07:00.209
What makes you say that?

78
00:07:00.209 --> 00:07:05.779
After my dad died, uncle Ethan kidnapped me for my shares.

79
00:07:05.779 --> 00:07:06.779
And Evelyn.

80
00:07:06.779 --> 00:07:16.500
You know she married dad six months ago, but her attitude about his death has just been really hard to put into words.

81
00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:19.459
What about Daniel?

82
00:07:19.459 --> 00:07:21.930
What about Daniel?

83
00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:26.930
Well, it seems like you can't trust anybody in your life, but what about him?

84
00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:33.899
Daniel cares about me. He won't do anything to her.

85
00:07:33.899 --> 00:07:37.149
Miss Vanderbilt, have you ever questioned Daniel?

86
00:07:37.149 --> 00:07:39.149
Or are you just avoiding that thought?

87
00:07:39.149 --> 00:07:43.850
Daniel saved my life. I want to be here without him.

88
00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:46.850
Are you so sure that he's the one who saved you?

89
00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:50.040
I saw it to save me. He got a long cut on his chest.

90
00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:54.230
And when I met Daniel, I saw that scar and I knew he was the man.

91
00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:59.649
Quite.

92
00:07:59.649 --> 00:08:02.860
What are you doing?

93
00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:27.220
Have you ever thought that maybe I could have been a man who saved you that night?

94
00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:28.220
How did you get that scar?

95
00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:31.410
It's not very unusual for bodyguards to get scars.

96
00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:41.639
Isn't it? You need to be more cautious about the people you keep around you, Miss Vanderbilt.

97
00:08:41.639 --> 00:09:02.009
Rodney has another property.

98
00:09:02.009 --> 00:09:04.009
Perhaps the documents have been transferred there.

99
00:09:04.009 --> 00:09:10.149
Also, the acquisition of the clear group was fully orchestrated by Ethan.

100
00:09:10.149 --> 00:09:18.809
Thanks, Gee. How'd you go?

101
00:09:18.809 --> 00:09:34.090
Dennis, there's somebody in your room.

102
00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:39.460
No! Why would you ask that?

103
00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:42.460
Maybe I just misheard him. Come, take a seat.

104
00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:54.710
The funeral director called. The autopsy's been approved.

105
00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:59.259
I wanted you to be the first to know, and hopefully you can respect my decision.

106
00:09:59.259 --> 00:10:08.870
I understand. Rodney was in fact murdered. We must find the killer.

107
00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:11.440
Thank you, Evelyn.

108
00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:23.379
Also, do you have the memory card with the surveillance footage on it? I'd like that back.

109
00:10:23.379 --> 00:10:26.509
Why? We already went through it, didn't we?

110
00:10:26.509 --> 00:10:31.830
Well, it contains my father's last moments. You know, I'd really like to have it.

111
00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:36.929
I'm sorry. I thought it was all settled, so I threw it out.

112
00:10:36.929 --> 00:10:48.009
You what? I'm really sorry. It's okay.

113
00:10:48.009 --> 00:10:49.009
Let me walk you out.

114
00:10:49.009 --> 00:10:59.059
Just one second.

115
00:10:59.059 --> 00:11:05.419
Hey, do you remember that thing I asked you to do?

116
00:11:05.419 --> 00:11:09.740
Do it. But make it perfectly safe. All right? Thanks.

117
00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:12.419
What about the autopsy?

118
00:11:12.419 --> 00:11:15.769
Just let her do it. She won't find anything.

119
00:11:15.769 --> 00:11:21.259
She was lying. I was definitely somebody in the room.

120
00:11:21.259 --> 00:11:27.580
A.P.I.

121
00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:29.980
It's violent.

122
00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:38.470
What is this?

123
00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:51.179
It's commoners' food. You can even stay safe while you're eating, huh?

124
00:11:51.179 --> 00:12:00.440
Gee, this is Emma. Emma, this is Gee. He's got some investigations to do for you.

125
00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:01.629
Nice to meet you.

126
00:12:01.629 --> 00:12:05.340
Um, are you also a bodyguard?

127
00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:16.389
No, he's not, but, you know, his skills are not inferior to one, that's for sure.

128
00:12:16.389 --> 00:12:21.389
Well, then you should join us. Another person, a bodyguard. I mean, it would help the investigation.

129
00:12:21.389 --> 00:12:23.389
Oh, that sounds perfect.

130
00:12:23.389 --> 00:12:26.320
Well, I'm not enough for you.

131
00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:28.320
Oh, it doesn't hurt to have another person here.

132
00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:32.320
Oh, no, a second. Have I ever made you feel unsafe or insecure in this whole thing?

133
00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.320
No, I just...

134
00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.320
Just checking.

135
00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:38.320
Or are you just giving me a hard time?

136
00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:41.950
Who's the target?

137
00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:47.950
It's my stepmother, Evelyn. She married my father six months ago, but I know nothing about her past.

138
00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:52.950
I need you to look into the people that she met after my father died and truck her financial transactions.

139
00:12:52.950 --> 00:13:06.139
Okay. All right, Gee. This is everything you need.

140
00:13:06.139 --> 00:13:10.139
I don't care if you don't have enough. You have connections. You'll find those connections.

141
00:13:10.139 --> 00:13:13.139
Have them send you money. Use Venmo's L. I don't care.

142
00:13:13.139 --> 00:13:20.309
Where were you? I called you 50 times and you didn't answer.

143
00:13:20.309 --> 00:13:23.309
We went out. Sorry, it didn't bring my phone.

144
00:13:23.309 --> 00:13:29.090
Were you out drinking?

145
00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:31.210
Yeah, a little.

146
00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:34.210
Why didn't you tell me that you were going out, Bob?

147
00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:44.080
Hey, remember who you are.

148
00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:45.879
Get out.

149
00:13:45.879 --> 00:13:48.009
You need to talk to him.

150
00:13:48.009 --> 00:13:54.429
Be right outside. If you need anything, call me.

151
00:13:54.429 --> 00:14:09.590
Now, you two are getting pretty close now, huh?

152
00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:12.590
Going out for drinks with him in the middle of the night.

153
00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:16.129
You ever think for a second about my feelings?

154
00:14:16.129 --> 00:14:18.129
He's my bodyguard.

155
00:14:18.129 --> 00:14:24.379
The one responsible for my safety you think he shouldn't spend all of his time with me?

156
00:14:24.379 --> 00:14:28.110
Now on. You can't go out with him at night.

157
00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:32.679
Careful. You're not even married yet.

158
00:14:32.679 --> 00:14:34.679
Emma, you've never talked to me like this.

159
00:14:34.679 --> 00:14:36.679
You've never treated me like this either.

160
00:14:36.679 --> 00:14:47.620
I'm so sorry. I just... I care about you too much.

161
00:14:47.620 --> 00:15:48.179
Miss Vanderbilt. Yes?

162
00:15:48.179 --> 00:15:53.110
I've got something about Liam. He is the son of the Austin Group's owner.

163
00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:58.110
Their company declared bankruptcy six months ago and his father committed suicide after that.

164
00:15:58.110 --> 00:16:03.090
Miss Vanderbilt?

165
00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:10.779
He is the son of the Austin Group's owner.

166
00:16:10.779 --> 00:17:04.299
Their company declared bankruptcy six months ago and his father committed suicide after that.

167
00:17:04.299 --> 00:17:05.299
What exactly do you want to know?

168
00:17:05.299 --> 00:17:09.859
I don't know. I'm just curious, I guess.

169
00:17:09.859 --> 00:17:13.730
I don't know anything about you or your life or your family.

170
00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:22.539
You don't need to know any of that. I should just focus on protecting you.

171
00:17:22.539 --> 00:17:27.180
I think I should completely trust you, but I don't know anything about you.

172
00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:31.240
My duty is to protect you. Everything I do is to keep you safe.

173
00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:35.779
What you've done for me goes beyond the scope of a bodyguard.

174
00:17:35.779 --> 00:17:40.740
I don't need a bodyguard about whom I know you don't think. You can leave.

175
00:17:40.740 --> 00:19:05.740
Just bringing me some medical supplies.

176
00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:30.589
Is your... I say getting better?

177
00:19:30.589 --> 00:19:35.839
I dreamt that you and Daniel betrayed Dad and me. You wouldn't do that, right?

178
00:19:35.839 --> 00:19:42.180
I loved your father very much. I would never hurt you.

179
00:19:42.180 --> 00:20:05.569
Well, it seems like you can't trust anybody in your life, but what about him?

180
00:20:05.569 --> 00:20:09.859
Turns out Liam knew it all along. Is Dad's death related to them?

181
00:20:09.859 --> 00:20:23.130
We trust you, but I don't know anything about you.

182
00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:26.130
What he's done for me goes beyond the scope of a bodyguard.

183
00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:30.829
I don't need a bodyguard about whom I know nothing. You can leave.

184
00:20:30.829 --> 00:20:48.069
It's Vanderbilt. Thought you far, man. You don't hear?

185
00:20:48.069 --> 00:20:54.470
Uh, Daniel. Daniel and Evelyn.

186
00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:59.240
Yeah, I saw them. What do you mean? You saw them. You can see now?

187
00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:05.009
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I saw them. I saw them. I see that.

188
00:21:05.009 --> 00:21:07.009
Yeah. Yeah.

189
00:21:07.009 --> 00:21:09.069
You drink tonight?

190
00:21:09.069 --> 00:21:11.299
Um...

191
00:21:11.299 --> 00:22:31.579
I wanted to ask you. How did you and my dad meet?

192
00:22:31.579 --> 00:22:34.579
Rodney, during the accident, I was attending nurse.

193
00:22:34.579 --> 00:22:39.799
He was just such a wise and kind man, so I fell in love with him.

194
00:22:39.799 --> 00:22:45.230
You were the first to find him, right?

195
00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:51.490
I brought him some fruit that morning, and when I walked in, I saw him clutching his heart, and...

196
00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:59.220
The must've been really hard for me.

197
00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:01.220
I always found your love story very hard, Rodney.

198
00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:09.680
And 30-year age difference in the, uh, conveniences of your marriage.

199
00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:11.680
Why are you asking me about this?

200
00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:18.130
I was blind. You inducted? So I still have so many questions.

201
00:23:18.130 --> 00:23:23.380
Evelyn and the shareholders have been keeping track of the company for me, and you and Daniel just...

202
00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:28.019
managing the affairs of the house. I really appreciate you.

203
00:23:28.019 --> 00:23:32.279
My family, aren't we? So at least I can do for Rodney.

204
00:23:32.279 --> 00:23:37.960
Yes, please.

205
00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:42.630
You know what? The autopsy report should be ready. Oh. Yeah?

206
00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:50.630
Conclusion. The cause of death is attributed to a sudden heart attack, likely resulting from severe coronary artery disease.

207
00:23:50.630 --> 00:24:00.059
It was just a heart attack. The funerals of three days, and right after that, the lawyer will be in the office to read the will.

208
00:24:00.059 --> 00:24:02.500
You're welcome to join.

209
00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:09.789
That idiot. Did she actually fire Liam?

210
00:24:09.789 --> 00:24:16.529
Yeah. Now that he's out of the picture, that'll be so much easier for us, right?

211
00:24:16.529 --> 00:24:18.529
All of her Mandarin on her side.

212
00:24:18.529 --> 00:24:22.359
If Liam gone, I don't think she'll be a threat to us.

213
00:24:22.359 --> 00:24:27.450
We're just gonna sit tight and wait for Ethan to reveal his cards.

214
00:24:27.450 --> 00:24:43.700
Sign this, and you'll officially become my personal assistant.

215
00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:46.940
You're what?

216
00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:52.529
Liam, I believe you won't hurt me.

217
00:24:52.529 --> 00:24:55.559
I mean, you've already saved me multiple times.

218
00:24:55.559 --> 00:24:57.839
And?

219
00:24:57.839 --> 00:25:00.900
And what?

220
00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:07.579
You're falling in love with me. Aren't you?

221
00:25:07.579 --> 00:25:08.579
Will you sign it?

222
00:25:08.579 --> 00:25:09.799
I'll sign it.

223
00:25:09.799 --> 00:25:16.299
The lawyer comes over tomorrow. After the funeral, he's gonna read the will. You will accompany me.

224
00:25:16.299 --> 00:25:26.130
Now that we're all here, let's step inside.

225
00:25:26.130 --> 00:25:31.250
I'm sorry, Miss Vanderbilt. Only those involved in today's meeting can get in.

226
00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:46.809
Subject. If you send something's off, click this pen once.

227
00:25:46.809 --> 00:25:51.210
Anything else?

228
00:25:51.210 --> 00:25:55.660
If you sense that you're in danger, click it twice.

229
00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:57.660
What happens if I click it twice?

230
00:25:57.660 --> 00:25:59.910
Go ahead. Try.

231
00:25:59.910 --> 00:26:31.910
We'll have two parts. Today we'll cover the shares of the company,

232
00:26:31.910 --> 00:26:37.910
and the second part concerning Mr. Vanderbilt's personal property will be read at his residence tomorrow.

233
00:26:37.910 --> 00:26:44.259
Mr. Rodney Vanderbilt owns a total of 48% of the Vanderbilt group's shares.

234
00:26:44.259 --> 00:26:50.259
Of that, 48%, 38% will be inherited by his daughter, Miss Emma Vanderbilt.

235
00:26:50.259 --> 00:26:54.259
The remaining 10% will be inherited by Miss Emma's future husband.

236
00:26:54.259 --> 00:27:02.609
However, Miss Emma's future husband can only officially take control of the shares one year after their marriage.

237
00:27:02.609 --> 00:27:08.309
Until that time, Emma will hold the shares in trust,

238
00:27:08.309 --> 00:27:15.029
and that's all the contents of Mr. Vanderbilt's wealth.

239
00:27:15.029 --> 00:27:18.029
Thank you. Please, wait right outside.

240
00:27:18.029 --> 00:27:31.140
This isn't exactly what we wanted to hear.

241
00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:38.259
This isn't exactly what we wanted to hear.

242
00:27:38.259 --> 00:27:43.490
So, let's get to the chase. Emma, what's your plan?

243
00:27:43.490 --> 00:27:47.480
Well, I don't think that's any of your business now, is it?

244
00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:50.900
We certainly need to know what the next president is.

245
00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:55.900
We need a lot of blind personal in this company, and this affects all of us.

246
00:27:55.900 --> 00:28:01.180
Transfer all of your shares to me for double the market value. How's that?

247
00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:06.910
That's more than enough to secure you for life, and it's my final offer.

248
00:28:06.910 --> 00:28:15.099
You trust somebody illegitimate to run this company?

249
00:28:15.099 --> 00:28:19.099
Emma, my patience is about to run out.

250
00:28:19.099 --> 00:28:23.259
Well, that's too bad. You know the future president cannot be this ultimate.

251
00:28:23.259 --> 00:28:29.950
Well, if you can't make a choice, allow me to help you.

252
00:28:29.950 --> 00:28:34.049
Let's call the board meeting right now. We'll select a new president.

253
00:28:34.049 --> 00:28:37.819
Alright, let's do it.

254
00:28:37.819 --> 00:28:53.089
You understand the proposal for this board is to strip you of your presidency?

255
00:28:53.089 --> 00:28:56.599
Very well. Joel, please come back in.

256
00:28:56.599 --> 00:29:01.819
I would like for you to record the second of our board meetings today.

257
00:29:01.819 --> 00:29:08.680
Ladies and gentlemen, the attendant for this meeting is a selection of a new president.

258
00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:17.380
Emma here is the largest shareholder of the Vanderbilt group, however she has lost the right to be the president.

259
00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:23.380
Of course, should she regain her sight, then this board, if we choose to, might revisit that choice.

260
00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:25.420
It's good too.

261
00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:40.619
My grandfather founded this company, but my father spent the last 30 years of his life dedicating himself to its prosperity.

262
00:29:40.619 --> 00:29:48.200
I believe, as his daughter, I will continue that legacy, and of course I'll keep the shareholders happy.

263
00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:52.329
I apologize for not informing you all in advance about me regaining my sight.

264
00:30:00.589 --> 00:30:08.299
Did you really think that you were going to leave here today without signing these papers?

265
00:30:08.299 --> 00:30:48.180
I think your current position suits you perfectly. I need you to call the police.

266
00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:50.339
Emma, I am your uncle.

267
00:30:50.339 --> 00:30:57.339
I believe what happened here today is Ethan's own doing. I mean, you all witnessed how he threatened me and kidnapped me.

268
00:30:57.339 --> 00:31:00.400
Whenever the police arrived, just make sure you tell them the truth.

269
00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:08.500
Mrs Vanderbilt, we had no idea that Ethan was shooting for the stars. Please, we completely have your back.

270
00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:12.099
Exactly. Thank you. If you'll excuse me.

271
00:31:12.099 --> 00:31:23.059
No.

272
00:31:23.059 --> 00:31:40.250
Let's get started.

273
00:31:40.250 --> 00:31:51.440
Mrs Emma, according to your father's will, you are set to inherit $15 million in cash, as well as four properties, vehicles, and stocks, all in your father's name. As for Mrs Vanderbilt.

274
00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:55.440
You will receive a monthly allowance of $50,000.

275
00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:57.559
What?

276
00:31:57.559 --> 00:32:02.329
Wait, no, no. Something's off about that.

277
00:32:02.329 --> 00:32:07.329
I know it is right. Mr Vanderbilt finalized the will just three days before his passing.

278
00:32:07.329 --> 00:32:12.329
As Rodney's wife, I have the right to question the validity of this will.

279
00:32:12.329 --> 00:32:14.329
Why are you questioning the validity?

280
00:32:14.329 --> 00:32:19.329
I mean, how come Mr Vanderbilt only has those assets listed?

281
00:32:19.329 --> 00:32:22.650
So are you just concerned about the stash?

282
00:32:22.650 --> 00:32:31.900
I'm just worried for you. You suspected there was foul play in your father's death, so maybe the will was fake too.

283
00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:34.900
Yes, we need to double check this will.

284
00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:41.630
Mrs Emma, if there's nothing else, we'll just need your signature on the will here.

285
00:32:41.630 --> 00:32:52.779
Okay. Could I have you do me a favor?

286
00:32:52.779 --> 00:32:53.779
Of course.

287
00:32:53.779 --> 00:32:57.869
I need you to draft a prenup for me.

288
00:32:57.869 --> 00:32:59.869
Daniel and I are getting married next month.
