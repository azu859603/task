00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Are you serious?

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Yeah.

3
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Congratulations. I'm sure Mr. Vanderbilt would have been happy for you too.

4
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.210
Thank you.

5
00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:12.619
Oh, Evelyn.

6
00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:16.519
Dear, I just want to say thank you.

7
00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:19.320
Everything that you've done for me.

8
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.320
Would you be the one to play in the wedding?

9
00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.269
Of course.

10
00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:29.329
It would be my honor.

11
00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:31.329
Okay.

12
00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:33.329
Well, I'm gonna go file this way.

13
00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:48.659
This is my room.

14
00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:51.619
Quite the actress, huh?

15
00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:54.100
When did you decide to marry Daniel?

16
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.100
You know that at the very least,

17
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.100
he's got something to do with all of this.

18
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.100
Daniel and I were always gonna get married.

19
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.649
And you know that Evelyn and him, I've been going your back.

20
00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:04.650
So you look like an idiot to you?

21
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:11.739
Daniel can only inherit the money if he decides to marry me.

22
00:01:11.739 --> 00:01:14.739
And that man will do anything to make sure that happens,

23
00:01:14.739 --> 00:01:16.739
which will certainly drive Evelyn crazy.

24
00:01:16.739 --> 00:01:22.290
Trust me, a woman's jealousy can be a total game changer.

25
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.219
So what?

26
00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:26.219
You're just gonna roll the dice on your marriage.

27
00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:32.230
Do you think that he and Evelyn had something to do with my father's stuff?

28
00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.939
Regardless of that, you should roll the dice on your future.

29
00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.939
And let's say they did have something to do with your father's death.

30
00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.939
Who's to say that you're not the next one to have an accident?

31
00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.120
Do you think Daniel would try and kill me too?
