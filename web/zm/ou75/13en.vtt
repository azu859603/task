00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Do you think Daniel would try and kill me too?

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.219
Why are you being so stubborn?

3
00:00:04.219 --> 00:00:07.219
I thought we agreed to collaborate here.

4
00:00:07.219 --> 00:00:09.220
I thought we agreed that you'd be my assistant.

5
00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:11.830
Don't cross the line.

6
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.390
You had someone replace the will haven't you?

7
00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.390
How could it end up like this?

8
00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.190
As clueless as you are.

9
00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:33.189
I said that you shouldn't be here.

10
00:00:33.189 --> 00:00:35.189
What? You're gonna marry her now?

11
00:00:35.189 --> 00:00:37.189
You're gonna make me your wedding planner? You know what?

12
00:00:37.189 --> 00:00:38.189
I'm not gonna have-

13
00:00:38.189 --> 00:00:41.189
You have no idea the sacrifices I made to get us.

14
00:00:41.189 --> 00:00:44.189
Marrying her is the only ticket to the Lord.

15
00:00:44.189 --> 00:00:46.189
If you put anything stupid,

16
00:00:46.189 --> 00:00:49.189
you'll be shark-bait for those decorators.

17
00:00:49.189 --> 00:00:56.280
I just-

18
00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.950
Daniel, I just care about you so much.

19
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.950
You had beasts of deuce Rodney and I did.

20
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:03.950
And you had me marry him.

21
00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:05.950
And I did. I would do anything for you.

22
00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:06.950
I froze in.

23
00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:32.459
Please don't forget I was the one who saved you when you were at rock bottom.

24
00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:37.409
Going on this planet loves you the way that I love you.
