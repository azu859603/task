00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.020
That is such a large sum. How are you going to explain it to her?

2
00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:05.019
We'll say...

3
00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:08.019
We'll say they were investment flops.

4
00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:10.019
Yeah, that happens the best of us.

5
00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.019
Do you really think Emma is the same girl who believes everything that you say?

6
00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:16.019
Her old man is dead.

7
00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:18.239
Who else does she have to believe?

8
00:00:18.239 --> 00:00:19.239
Besides me?

9
00:00:19.239 --> 00:00:37.829
Sit up some accounts. I think they plan on monitoring the money through investments.

10
00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.829
You're not planning on revealing your identity to them, are you?

11
00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:50.750
Yeah, I'm in danger. Daniel got a hold of her accident on insurance money somehow, probably by making her sign something while she was blind.

12
00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:58.539
But if they get a hold of that money, I'm thinking they're going to set up some sort of accident for her.

13
00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:02.539
We don't forget about your brother's case, right? His death is probably linked to Rodney.

14
00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:06.540
Are you into such lengths just to get in there? Over that damn Emma.

15
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:13.620
Tell me you're falling for it. Are you out of your mind?

16
00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.900
How's your day? They give you a hard time?

17
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.219
No. You're fine.

18
00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:22.219
Good. I'm glad.

19
00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:35.379
How was wedding venues counting?

20
00:01:35.379 --> 00:01:39.370
Well, why don't you see it for yourself?

21
00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.980
If you like this spot, I can book it by tomorrow.

22
00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:50.230
It's beautiful. You love it.

23
00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:53.230
While I have you both here, I actually wanted to discuss something.
