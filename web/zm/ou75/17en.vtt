00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.270
What is it, babe?

2
00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:08.019
Well, we're going to be getting married soon, and I feel like we deserve some alone time.

3
00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:14.070
And with Dad gone, you deserve some space, too.

4
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.500
So, I think it's time for you to find your own house.

5
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.699
Would you agree?

6
00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.339
Of course.

7
00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:27.140
Great.

8
00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.739
You're on the same page.

9
00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:39.250
I actually agreed to let Emma throw me out.

10
00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:52.539
What should I have said?

11
00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:54.340
What?

12
00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.200
You don't think I already know what's going on between me two?

13
00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.799
We've got the same goal.

14
00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:02.310
How many for the cash as well?

15
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:04.310
And how am I supposed to believe that?

16
00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:06.310
Well, I did help with all the trauma.

17
00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.310
The will exchanged, and I'm in the size.

18
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.310
Don't you think it's a little too late to be talking about who you trust, and who you don't?

19
00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:13.310
What are you talking about?

20
00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:19.500
You hired someone to steal the will the night before Ron had died.

21
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.500
Who's me?

22
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.769
You know it really bugs me, Daniel.

23
00:01:24.769 --> 00:01:28.829
I know that you also happen to change that will before he died.

24
00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.480
And I also happen to know that a guy like you want to do very well in jail.

25
00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.760
So tell me, were you nervous to get caught?
