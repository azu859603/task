00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Pretty convenient time for Ronnie to die, don't you think?

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
What do you mean by that?

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.179
I know what you're after, Dan.

4
00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:13.500
So, considering you already know my identity, why don't we just come to the chase and start working together here?

5
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.859
I get you your money, you give me a cut.

6
00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.859
What's your plan?

7
00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:22.550
This is a friend of mine.

8
00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.739
It's got all the connections.

9
00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:26.739
It's your illegal risk involved.

10
00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:32.289
If you changed the will, why is the last world different from the one you changed?

11
00:00:32.289 --> 00:00:38.609
I've got no idea.

12
00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:42.609
Daniel, I heard you were shopping around for some prices, but all of them were through the roofs.

13
00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:44.670
It was quite the deal breaker.

14
00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.060
You got to take this deal with me or you can walk away.

15
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.060
That's up to you.

16
00:00:51.060 --> 00:01:08.799
We'll see you guys around.

17
00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:13.170
What do you want me to say, Evan?

18
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.170
You never trusted me.

19
00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:23.180
Getting close to me is your plan from the start.

20
00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:29.939
Even this whole love thing that was just a ploy, right?

21
00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.159
So, you just had me come up here to give me my walking papers, son.

22
00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.120
You're just seeing the truth.
