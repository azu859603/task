1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,870
With the two of them.

2
00:00:03,669 --> 00:00:05,589
I'm sure what kind of crap you'd take up on me,

3
00:00:05,589 --> 00:00:07,589
that her nephew pushed me away again.

4
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:13,359
A year ago,

5
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:18,579
a fandered old group was about to require my brother's company.

6
00:00:18,579 --> 00:00:21,769
The night before the deal was about to go down,

7
00:00:21,769 --> 00:00:25,030
he'd killed himself.

8
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:26,629
To find out what really happened,

9
00:00:26,629 --> 00:00:29,300
I accepted a job offer from your father,

10
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,740
to become your new bodyguard.

11
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:34,140
Did you find out what happened?

12
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,320
Well, but I know something's up.

13
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,719
The night that your father died,

14
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,219
they were by up papers from my brother's company in the safe.

15
00:00:42,219 --> 00:00:45,820
And the next day, they were gone.

16
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,340
What do you mean the night my father died?

17
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:48,619
What were you doing in the safe?

18
00:00:48,619 --> 00:00:51,020
Daniel posted a job in the black market,

19
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,259
G hacked your home network,

20
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:55,299
and we intercepted that task.

21
00:00:55,299 --> 00:00:58,539
I was the one that was at your house that night.

22
00:00:58,539 --> 00:00:59,659
Well, if Daniel set this up,

23
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:02,380
why didn't it, why didn't it, Hannah?

24
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:05,769
I got the will, I checked it out, copied it,

25
00:01:05,769 --> 00:01:06,810
and I put it back.

26
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:09,930
If I knew what was gonna happen to your father,

27
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,290
I would have stopped it.

28
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:20,700
I did it though, and I'm sorry, I really am.

29
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,829
So Daniel knew, and your dad wasn't gonna make it,

30
00:01:23,829 --> 00:01:25,900
and that's where you switched the will.

31
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:28,849
I'm gonna help you nail this killer,

32
00:01:28,849 --> 00:01:31,069
but there's more you have to know.

33
00:01:31,069 --> 00:01:40,140
I found something at Daniel's house.

34
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,099
You're with him all the time,

35
00:01:41,099 --> 00:01:42,540
I don't have proof that he did anything,

36
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:51,370
but you need to watch out, Emma, Emma.
