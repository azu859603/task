1
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:20,019
You passed out. I got your meds checked. The ones you've been taking since you lost your vision.

2
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:22,000
My meds.

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:31,359
Yeah. Evelyn and Daniel switched him out ages ago. But we caught it and I don't think there's been

4
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,990
a lot of harm done. Thank you, Liam.

5
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:58,640
No more solo superhero moves, okay? I'll handle it for you.

6
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:23,739
All they're good. You have some nerve coming into my office after a swiping 50 mil for me.

7
00:01:23,739 --> 00:01:27,659
I gave you a contract, Daniel. You made that call yourself. I had nothing to do with it and you

8
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:32,140
know it. So why don't you explain to me how I swiped 50 million from you?

9
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:37,950
You introduced me to that god. How am I supposed to believe you have no connection?

10
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:41,950
I've introduced a lot of people to that guy. If I was blamed every time something went wrong,

11
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:47,629
I'd be broke or dead by now. So tell me, Daniel, did I lose my cut?

12
00:01:47,629 --> 00:01:50,670
Yeah. You know, I'm going to call the cops because you're setting me up right now.

13
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:54,590
All right, call the cops. Have fun explaining to them where that 50 mil came from.

14
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:58,689
And don't forget about Mr. Bannerville's death.
