00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.350
What the fuck are you talking about?

2
00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.110
Rodney's death, no, that was an accident.

3
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:08.589
Cut the lives.

4
00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:12.269
A sudden spike in potassium chloride can alter the heart rate.

5
00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.189
And even though it's absorbed relatively quickly,

6
00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:17.469
hair spills secrets, Daniel.

7
00:00:18.469 --> 00:00:26.329
Get the fuck out of my office.

8
00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:28.980
You know, I almost forgot.

9
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.520
I'm a kept-a-lock for dad's hair before the funeral.

10
00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.390
You owe me, you don't forget it.

11
00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:49.859
Do you think he'll take the bait?

12
00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:53.789
Well, he's definitely feeling the pressure, that's for sure.

13
00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.740
What's him?

14
00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:01.579
Daniel's clearly freaking out right now.

15
00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:08.900
It's just a little test.

16
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.019
If he stays and investigates,

17
00:01:10.019 --> 00:01:14.920
he's gonna know that I was bluffing.

18
00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.120
Even if we link him to dad's death,

19
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.750
we need more to put him away.

20
00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.340
Once we leak him, that was the killer.

21
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.500
We'll figure it out.
