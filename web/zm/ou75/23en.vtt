00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:02.229
What is it?

2
00:00:02.229 --> 00:00:07.240
If one of these days

3
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:12.400
Not around

4
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.379
Forget about playing detective on Daniel

5
00:00:17.379 --> 00:00:22.030
Call the cops

6
00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:26.030
Daniel's got a $50 million ticket to a jail cell for the next decade

7
00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:27.030
Case closed

8
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.059
You don't need to put yourself in any more danger

9
00:00:30.059 --> 00:00:35.340
I can't make that promise

10
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.340
What do you say?

11
00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.990
Are you gonna be okay?

12
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.990
You're gonna be fine

13
00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.939
I can't lose you

14
00:00:44.939 --> 00:01:02.490
What the fuck are you doing?

15
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.489
Someone's getting riled up

16
00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.489
Careful don't hurt yourself

17
00:01:06.489 --> 00:01:08.489
Next time you wanna go after me

18
00:01:08.489 --> 00:01:09.489
That's fine

19
00:01:09.489 --> 00:01:12.739
You make sure Emma is not there

20
00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:14.500
Don't worry

21
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.500
The contract's still in both of your names

22
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.569
So there's no getting out of it for either of you

23
00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:23.590
You lay a finger on her

24
00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.939
You're gonna regret it

25
00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:28.099
Hey it's your move buddy

26
00:01:28.099 --> 00:01:30.099
If the boss doesn't cancel

27
00:01:30.099 --> 00:01:33.450
The mission is still on the table

28
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.450
The rules do

29
00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:35.510
The boss dies

30
00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:36.510
The mission's over

31
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:37.510
And trust me I want to get vanish

32
00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:38.510
Right fuck it now
