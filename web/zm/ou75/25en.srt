1
00:00:05,169 --> 00:00:06,169
Liam?

2
00:00:06,169 --> 00:00:20,260
Goodbye, Emma.

3
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:22,149
Take care.

4
00:00:22,149 --> 00:00:41,619
It's ever survived challenging to hit, man.

5
00:00:41,619 --> 00:00:42,619
It's getting better.

6
00:00:42,619 --> 00:00:45,229
You know, I had to do it.

7
00:00:45,229 --> 00:00:47,060
You know the rules?

8
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:50,060
It's the only way that a target can get out of that deal.

9
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:53,280
You fucking out of your mind?

10
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,969
I don't trust Daniel, gee.

11
00:00:57,969 --> 00:00:59,969
I was protecting Emma the best way that I could.

12
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:02,829
You remember what I said.

13
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:09,180
If anything happens to me, you give the money to Daniel and you get Emma out of here.

14
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,180
Don't tell me these are your last wishes.

15
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:13,239
I'm not gonna help you.

16
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,239
Okay?

17
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:18,319
You're gonna do it, gee.

18
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:19,349
You know why?

19
00:01:19,349 --> 00:01:22,049
Because you're my friend.

20
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:30,060
Things he can cut me out just like that.
