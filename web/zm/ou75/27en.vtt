00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.439
I'm screwed.

2
00:00:08.439 --> 00:00:09.640
What happened?

3
00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:13.560
The hitman I hired canceled my commission.

4
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.759
Damn it!

5
00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:21.940
I should have known Liam was just stalling for time.

6
00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:23.539
What do you mean you have nothing?

7
00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:25.440
Those launch sharks are not going to buy that.

8
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:31.140
They are going to eat us alive.

9
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.070
Emma.

10
00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:34.700
Right, Emma.

11
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:44.350
If I beg for her forgiveness, she'll probably save me.

12
00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.450
How could she possibly forgive you after everything that happened?

13
00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:53.609
Because it was all your fault.

14
00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:55.740
You planned the whole thing.

15
00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:00.759
I was just some sweet innocent boy who lost his way.

16
00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:05.459
Daniel, after everything that we've been through together,

17
00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:07.459
after I saved your life from the creditors,

18
00:01:07.459 --> 00:01:12.079
this is how you're going to thank me.

19
00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:19.829
Evo, you really think I have feelings for you?

20
00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:24.430
You have been kissing my ass this entire time.

21
00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:39.760
All of your secrets, and I'm going to tell.

22
00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.450
I know you do, sweetie.

23
00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.939
And that's exactly why you'll keep your mouth shut.

24
00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.939
Because I don't mind taking another life.
