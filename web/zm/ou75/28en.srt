1
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:10,919
And I need to confess something to you.

2
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:12,660
I'm listening.

3
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:17,070
And I'm so sorry. I can't live without you.

4
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,359
Everything you want to know, I'll tell you.

5
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,510
Just give me a chance.

6
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:25,089
Evelyn, the woman's evil.

7
00:00:25,089 --> 00:00:29,089
She manipulated me into taking away your property.

8
00:00:29,089 --> 00:00:31,089
I didn't know what I was thinking.

9
00:00:31,089 --> 00:00:33,759
I just... love you.

10
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:36,049
Since the moment we met...

11
00:00:36,049 --> 00:00:48,859
Stop it, Daniel! You killed my father.

12
00:00:48,859 --> 00:00:51,219
I didn't!

13
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:54,219
How many times do I have to tell you your father's death was an accident?

14
00:00:54,219 --> 00:00:56,219
Then why didn't you sneak into my room to steal the hair?

15
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:59,859
Which wasn't his, by the way. I cut it from a wig.

16
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:06,790
This was Liam's idea, wasn't it?

17
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:08,890
Yeah. You two ganged up on me.

18
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:13,030
And we caught your murderer.

19
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:21,340
Are you trying to scare me?

20
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:24,340
The police don't have enough evidence, so they're not going to catch me.

21
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:28,060
But they will. It's just a matter of time.

22
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:31,409
Okay.
