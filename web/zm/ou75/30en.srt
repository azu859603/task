1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:17,640
Okay, what are you doing here? So that's why you're trying to get him to kill you, huh?

2
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,739
It's the easiest way leader said you wouldn't act alone Emma. What if I didn't show up in time?

3
00:00:21,739 --> 00:00:25,679
What would have happened? You have any idea? I don't want you taking these risks for me

4
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:33,649
So what other just put yourself in danger?

5
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:38,500
You have any idea how worried I was about you

6
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:51,350
So glad you're home

7
00:00:51,829 --> 00:01:02,740
And why are you here? Surely you're not missing me. I wanted to thank you

8
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:14,500
For taking care of dad and that's for everything else

9
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:21,129
You know when dad met you you had

10
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:28,480
Decent job you had a wonderful life and you gave everything up for that jerk

11
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:53,640
I think he really loved you though. That means anything to you Daniel talked to me last night

12
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:59,659
He told me everything you know and said that you manipulate it. No, no, no, no

13
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:09,780
Evelyn for the record. I think it was the other way around. Yeah, it doesn't mean that I forgive you

14
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:13,479
but

15
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:21,569
You made dad very happy and it's last few years

16
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:25,919
And I do appreciate that

17
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:44,099
It's a year's worth of living expenses. I know Daniel to get what he wants. He will go to any lengths even the most extreme

18
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:50,870
Be careful

19
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,870
Nothing can be worse than the death of my father

20
00:02:53,349 --> 00:02:57,270
I'll bring that man to justice

21
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:14,939
Even if it takes my life

22
00:03:14,939 --> 00:03:20,740
Spit it out. You know who changed your father's will it was Liam

23
00:03:21,979 --> 00:03:27,650
So aren't you worried he has ulterior motives? I trust him

24
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:34,099
You trust him

25
00:03:34,099 --> 00:03:37,379
See that's funny cuz I thought you guys met a few days ago, you know

26
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:39,580
He took the money that you stole from me

27
00:03:41,789 --> 00:03:45,270
Also, his brother lost to us in a commercial battle and lost his business

28
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:49,349
Anything else you want to tell me? I get it

29
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:58,020
You have feelings for him. What are you doing? You know what? Go ahead. Call the cops

30
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:01,379
Let's see if you can get me convicted for that shady video you took

31
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:07,020
I have your signature on the transfer agreement and as for Rodney's death

32
00:04:07,659 --> 00:04:10,199
Well, the evidence got deleted

33
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:17,339
You know Liam's in pretty hot water now

34
00:04:17,939 --> 00:04:28,029
You can imagine it's pretty damning evidence with him transferring money laundering it through his friend's account all the fingerprints on Rodney's will

35
00:04:28,589 --> 00:04:31,509
It's enough to lock a man up for years. Don't you think?

36
00:04:32,069 --> 00:04:40,730
What do you want? I want you to marry me as planned

37
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:44,339
Think about it

38
00:04:44,339 --> 00:05:12,439
Not too well. I have to say your call came as a bit of a surprise

39
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:30,910
Where did you get this?

40
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:34,269
I wonder how Daniel will react when he finds out how much money you took from him

41
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:38,600
Or maybe you just don't give his shit since he basically got a gun to his head

42
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,399
With backup security footage from the study room surveillance camera

43
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,720
Where's the evidence Evelyn?

44
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,240
Of Daniel committing the murder. I know you know where it is

45
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:54,600
Why didn't you come here sooner? And that was the perfect time. Don't you think Daniel's a very meticulous guy?

46
00:05:54,600 --> 00:06:00,060
But I don't really think he understood how valuable you really were and I do I think you'd make a great partner, right?

47
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:01,800
You're right

48
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:06,069
But why would I trust you with such a trump card? It's because you have no other option. I

49
00:06:07,009 --> 00:06:12,610
Tell Daniel what you have on him. I don't think he'll let you survive the rest of tonight now granted

50
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:15,850
That's the worst case scenario, but knowing how crazy that guy is

51
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:20,089
I don't think he would let you off too easily. You just know too much

52
00:06:20,769 --> 00:06:29,990
Don't you fine? I will give you the footage under two conditions

53
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:36,910
What are they one I need money

54
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:41,500
Two I need security to ensure that I get out of here safely deal

55
00:06:42,139 --> 00:06:44,180
I'll come pick you up tonight

56
00:06:44,180 --> 00:07:02,279
Make sure everything's ready Evelyn. She still is the footage that it was deleted. She's gonna give it to me tonight

57
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:04,389
Let me go with you

58
00:07:04,389 --> 00:07:06,329
It's too dangerous

59
00:07:06,329 --> 00:07:42,350
Just wait at the house and call the police when I'm down. Okay, how are you gonna pay me show me the footage

60
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:59,300
You know why are you in the morning tonight?

61
00:08:05,339 --> 00:08:39,220
You're the villo that I set up for you. I'll put the security in place

62
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:42,330
Some will pick you up three hours after you arrive

63
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:44,929
What's your plan exactly?

64
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:47,220
Just do what I say

65
00:08:47,220 --> 00:09:08,509
Evelyn it's all there

66
00:09:17,049 --> 00:10:01,940
Good. Good. It took you over there now. They fall asleep. This is it

67
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:25,889
It's time to end

68
00:10:25,889 --> 00:10:27,139
How did you find me?

69
00:10:27,139 --> 00:10:29,139
Well, you don't want to invite me in

70
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:39,669
Evelyn I need your help. I'm at the end of my road here. I don't know what to do

71
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:43,759
I'm sorry, but you should have thought about that before you crossed me

72
00:10:44,470 --> 00:11:05,649
Baby, you're really breaking my heart here. Don't you have a seat? Let's talk. Please

73
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:09,970
I'm so stupid to have believed you

74
00:11:10,409 --> 00:11:16,009
This whole time I was just a pawn in your game. No see you're not that stupid after all

75
00:11:16,169 --> 00:11:18,840
Or else you wouldn't have sighted with Liam after our little chat

76
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:26,580
I don't know what you're talking about. How did the cops know what happened with Rodney then? You know see I had this

77
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:34,990
Perfectly planned out and then you ruined it. Stop it get off me. You copied the tapes and then made a goddamn fool out of me

78
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:45,240
No, no, I didn't no you didn't like I should have known

79
00:11:45,820 --> 00:12:36,090
From the very start like my suit. I'm here from the police. Yeah, or do you think Danny might have run away?

80
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:46,960
I don't think so. Got some friends in the smuggling business and they haven't found anything suspicious yet

81
00:12:47,379 --> 00:13:04,809
We have helped me

82
00:13:04,809 --> 00:13:11,500
Who isn't sounds like Evelyn think she's in trouble. Just stay right here. I'm gonna be right back, okay?

83
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:12,080
You say sweet soon enough. You're just gonna be a body in a bag

84
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:19,389
Before I get what I want you wish I

85
00:14:20,179 --> 00:14:23,580
Could see your Liam's biggest weakness

86
00:14:24,299 --> 00:14:26,779
He'll do anything I say

87
00:14:26,779 --> 00:14:32,289
What did you do to him nothing yet? No, he's probably still looking for you

88
00:14:32,889 --> 00:14:35,429
But now that we got some time

89
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:41,899
Figured we can talk do you have anything you want to say you know as your last words

90
00:14:42,539 --> 00:14:46,980
It was all your fault Emma a

91
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:53,000
Pretty rich girl fell into my arms at my lowest point

92
00:14:53,519 --> 00:15:01,059
What was I supposed to say no, I didn't feel pretty bad about Evelyn

93
00:15:02,009 --> 00:15:16,779
What did you do to Evelyn? I did what I had to do. She betrayed me. You did it. You're a murderer

94
00:15:17,539 --> 00:15:20,570
You see

95
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:24,210
Evelyn did so much believe when I had nothing

96
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:30,559
Okay, she cooked she cleaned she even paid off a couple of my dad's blessed her heart

97
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:39,700
But I did it anyway, but you

98
00:15:40,379 --> 00:15:42,179
My dear

99
00:15:42,179 --> 00:15:50,110
But you made me do it quit lying to yourself

100
00:15:50,909 --> 00:16:03,149
You're using Evelyn all day a man like you doesn't deserve love so much for the chit-chat

101
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,320
At the time the boyfriend's gonna be here any second. Oh

102
00:16:11,539 --> 00:16:13,389
And on time

103
00:16:13,429 --> 00:16:15,070
Stay right there

104
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:24,740
Right on time stay right there

105
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:30,600
You let her go. I'll give you the money. Well, Liam

106
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,799
I don't think you're in any place to tell me what to do

107
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:36,259
Unless you want me to take her with me

108
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:38,879
far just

109
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:44,740
Tell me what to do first. I want my money back. Okay now

110
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:53,259
Gee transfer the 150 million to Daniels account. Just do it

111
00:16:55,129 --> 00:16:57,039
There

112
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:04,220
What else anything else save all your first-class body mark Liam

113
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:10,089
So if I expect to get out here safe, you need to be somewhat incapacitate

114
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:18,490
Hurt yourself. No, stop it. No, don't do it. Do it. Don't you want ammo, right? Come on

115
00:17:19,049 --> 00:17:21,269
We have Liam

116
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:24,829
Oh, it's okay. It's okay. All right

117
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:40,819
Stop it

118
00:18:06,869 --> 00:18:55,049
It's time for you to go to the funeral
