00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:03.100
Hello there, Auntie.

2
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:04.099
Jesus.

3
00:00:04.099 --> 00:00:06.139
Why are you running away?

4
00:00:06.139 --> 00:00:08.140
I do not want to save you, Captain.

5
00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.839
You know I can help you.

6
00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:13.730
I'm here in my way.

7
00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:15.730
I have an elder in my pack.

8
00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:17.730
You can find out what your father is.

9
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.460
Trust me, Auntie.

10
00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:20.500
Follow me.

11
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.500
Let's go.

12
00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:38.899
Where am I?

13
00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:40.280
Hey.

14
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.280
That was close.

15
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.950
Yeah.

16
00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:43.950
No one is here anymore.

17
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.119
I'll take over the time of me.

18
00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:10.879
Your father isn't a bloody man.

19
00:01:10.879 --> 00:01:11.879
What?

20
00:01:11.879 --> 00:01:17.560
I have to stay and find who my father is.
