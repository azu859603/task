00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.500
Let go of my daughter, Eric.

2
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.360
How are you still alive?

3
00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.439
Why didn't you tell me you were alive all these years?

4
00:00:10.439 --> 00:00:15.490
I need to get my daughter out of here.

5
00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.570
No.

6
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.750
She's not going anywhere, because she's also my daughter.

7
00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.739
That's my father?

8
00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:32.009
I think I want to stay in love to get to know my father.

9
00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.170
Are you crazy?

10
00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.990
He just tried to strangle you.

11
00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:40.009
He didn't know, Mom.

12
00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:43.000
I won't allow it.

13
00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.439
Childy, my husband's birthday is tomorrow.

14
00:00:47.439 --> 00:00:51.840
I don't get to control me my whole life.

15
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:58.950
Stay.

16
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.390
Carolyn, be safe here.

17
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.390
I promise.
