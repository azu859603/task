1
00:00:04,269 --> 00:00:06,269
Hello Caroline.

2
00:00:06,269 --> 00:00:08,359
Who is here?

3
00:00:08,359 --> 00:00:10,359
My name is Maya.

4
00:00:10,359 --> 00:00:12,359
I'm your inner wolf.

5
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:15,599
Hey.

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,879
You're awake.

7
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:19,879
Are you feeling okay?

8
00:00:19,879 --> 00:00:22,839
Don't tell him about me Caroline.

9
00:00:22,839 --> 00:00:23,839
I'm fine.

10
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:26,839
I think yesterday I was just a little sugar.

11
00:00:26,839 --> 00:00:27,839
Don't worry.

12
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:30,839
Maybe I should see you downstairs after I change.

13
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:31,839
Sure.

14
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:32,840
Okay, take your time.

15
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:41,109
Have a bird that Caroline.

16
00:00:41,109 --> 00:00:43,109
Maya, are you here?

17
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:45,109
How come I cannot see you?

18
00:00:45,109 --> 00:00:48,369
Underline in there Caroline.

19
00:00:48,369 --> 00:00:49,369
Finally I'm free.

20
00:00:49,369 --> 00:00:51,369
And so are you.

21
00:00:51,369 --> 00:00:54,369
But there is one more surprise waiting for you.

22
00:00:54,369 --> 00:00:56,659
Mr. Price.

23
00:00:56,659 --> 00:00:57,659
Get dressed.

24
00:00:57,659 --> 00:01:21,040
I will tell you about it downstairs.

25
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:28,090
Touch him.

26
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:29,090
I think you're doing it.

27
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:31,599
Jacob is your maid Caroline.

28
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:33,599
What do you think you're doing Jacob?

29
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:38,599
We didn't know Caroline turns out to be my mate.

30
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:42,000
Is this true?

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,269
You can't outrun fate Alec.

32
00:01:46,269 --> 00:01:47,269
Alec.

33
00:01:47,269 --> 00:01:51,780
Now, watch yourself Jacob.

34
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:57,230
I have an announcement to make.

35
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:01,540
I've decided to name my successor.

36
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:06,750
The next alpha of the bloody moon.

37
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:13,620
My son, Alec.

38
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:22,199
Yes, Alec.

39
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:28,000
No Caroline.

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Wait, please, please Caroline.

41
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,129
Why did you tell me your Jacob's mate?

42
00:02:32,129 --> 00:02:34,669
You can tell me you're an ordinary son.

43
00:02:34,669 --> 00:02:36,669
What are you?

44
00:02:36,669 --> 00:02:37,669
Alec.

45
00:02:37,669 --> 00:02:40,669
Get rid of this bastard tramp already.

46
00:02:40,669 --> 00:02:43,669
We both know she's just a stain on the bloody moon.

47
00:02:43,669 --> 00:02:46,669
You don't have to label me peacefully.

48
00:02:46,669 --> 00:02:47,669
Thank you.

49
00:02:47,669 --> 00:02:51,090
Don't act all high in my tea.

50
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:52,150
Oh.

51
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:55,340
I'm not the one who's flirting with the next alpha.

52
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:58,340
But already has a mate.

53
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,340
Admit it.

54
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,340
You just want to be the next Luna.

55
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,139
This is pointless.

56
00:03:03,139 --> 00:03:05,139
I'm down big herring really.

57
00:03:05,139 --> 00:03:06,139
Good.

58
00:03:06,139 --> 00:03:07,139
No Caroline.

59
00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:08,139
Alec deserves better anyways.

60
00:03:08,139 --> 00:03:09,500
No Caroline.

61
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,500
Wait, please.

62
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,939
Shut up.

63
00:03:11,939 --> 00:03:16,199
But bestly, don't pretend you care about me or the bloody moon.

64
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:19,870
You're selfish and ignorant.

65
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:22,870
If you come one more time, you're Caroline again.

66
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,129
I'm not going to go with you, you.

67
00:03:25,129 --> 00:03:28,800
As long as I'm the alpha, you don't belong here.

68
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:36,360
Caroline!

69
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,360
But it's so hard.

70
00:03:39,360 --> 00:04:14,699
Wait.

71
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:24,910
Talk to me.

72
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:37,220
Are you falling for Jacob?

73
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:59,540
That's why you keep hiding from me.

74
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,540
What do you want, Jacob?

75
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,540
Listen.

76
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:05,730
I didn't really want my mate to be a mix of bastard.

77
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:07,730
But I accepted the goddess decision.

78
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:11,019
If you stop fooling around with another man,

79
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:13,019
I will kindly accept you as my mate.

80
00:05:13,019 --> 00:05:16,209
Not the most ridiculous thing I heard today.

81
00:05:16,209 --> 00:05:19,209
If you want a place in the bloody moon,

82
00:05:19,209 --> 00:05:23,189
you only answer to me.

83
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:25,019
Jacob.

84
00:05:25,019 --> 00:05:28,019
If I want a place in the bloody moon,

85
00:05:28,019 --> 00:05:30,019
I'm going to ask alpha.

86
00:05:30,019 --> 00:05:33,120
Or the second alpha.

87
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,620
Alec.

88
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,620
And you are no one in here, so...

89
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,620
Why are you telling me?

90
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:42,069
Just stop it on ID.

91
00:05:42,069 --> 00:05:45,250
For the first time,

92
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,250
a woman there to speak to me like that.

93
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,730
I like your attitude.

94
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:52,860
I make sure you become my Luna.

95
00:05:52,860 --> 00:06:01,029
You are all in Jacob.

96
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:10,769
You are all in Jacob.

97
00:06:10,769 --> 00:06:15,370
I guess the new bitch isn't taking directives while, huh?

98
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:16,370
I can get you resources.

99
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:17,370
Men.

100
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:18,370
Weapons.

101
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:19,370
Money.

102
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:20,370
Anything.

103
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:25,959
You can do what you want with Alec.

104
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:26,959
But...

105
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:29,339
You have to kill Carolyn for me.

106
00:06:29,339 --> 00:06:31,439
How does that sound?

107
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:34,699
You want me to kill my own mate.

108
00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:36,860
Oh relax.

109
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:39,860
It's not like you need her to be the next alpha anyway.

110
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:48,459
You don't get to tell me what to do with my mate Paisley.

111
00:06:48,459 --> 00:06:50,899
Once I'm the alpha,

112
00:06:50,899 --> 00:06:52,899
you're going to be dead anyways.

113
00:06:52,899 --> 00:06:59,029
Now that everybody is here,

114
00:06:59,029 --> 00:07:01,029
we shall get down to business.

115
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:02,319
Jacob,

116
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,319
state your case.

117
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:09,790
Our life's presence poses a threat to all of us.

118
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:12,790
Me and the bastard child of our alpha Gordon.

119
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:14,790
And a mix of breed.

120
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:17,790
The hunters will be at our doorstep any second.

121
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:21,790
We can let that scummy hybrid

122
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:23,790
taint our royal blood.

123
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:26,720
We have to kill her.

124
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,720
You fatherless gang.

125
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,720
This bastard tramp.

126
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,170
And you, Alec.

127
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:36,170
You knowingly brought a threat to our clan

128
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:37,170
telling formulas.

129
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:39,170
Why we should be a threat?

130
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:40,170
She's Gordon's daughter.

131
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:42,170
Why do you have hybrid keyed?

132
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,170
We don't know about it.

133
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:44,170
Gordon?

134
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:46,170
I didn't know I answered a you Mallory.

135
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:48,170
Leave my daughter alone.

136
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:50,170
I'll still have the bloody one.

137
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,170
You should have never mingled with the hunter.

138
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:53,170
Yes.

139
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:54,170
That offspring of yours.

140
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:56,170
Link's shame upon our clan.

141
00:07:57,170 --> 00:08:00,259
Just tell me what I need to do.

142
00:08:00,259 --> 00:08:03,000
Just stay with the blood on me.

143
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,470
Jacob,

144
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:07,569
state your task.

145
00:08:07,569 --> 00:08:10,360
Now.

146
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,360
There's a med scene called the Panther Act,

147
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,360
which is hidden in the Grey Mountain.

148
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,360
It's pretty much immortalized a werewolf.

149
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,360
If you're dreaming the Panther Act to prove your worth,

150
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,360
you'll be your only option.

151
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,360
No rages.

152
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,360
I won't allow it.

153
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,360
I will do that.

154
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,420
I complete this task.

155
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:33,419
Will I be allowed to stay with the bloody moon?

156
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:42,169
Yes.

157
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:43,169
It's a death drop.

158
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:44,169
I'm not letting go.

159
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:48,129
I'm tired of being called names my whole life.

160
00:08:48,129 --> 00:08:51,409
I'm telling my father, and yet,

161
00:08:51,409 --> 00:08:54,409
I'm still being questioned.

162
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:56,570
I know that I can use my powers.

163
00:08:56,570 --> 00:09:00,570
The only way for me out of this is to prove

164
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:02,570
that I deserve to be here.

165
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:04,570
Then I'm coming with you.

166
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:06,269
Don't you get it?

167
00:09:06,269 --> 00:09:08,269
I have to do it by myself.

168
00:09:08,269 --> 00:09:10,269
To prove that I will.

169
00:09:10,269 --> 00:09:13,289
I will.

170
00:09:13,289 --> 00:09:14,539
Protect you.

171
00:09:14,539 --> 00:09:17,659
Till I stop breathing.

172
00:09:17,659 --> 00:09:25,100
So, what's the plan?

173
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,100
My future alpha.

174
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,139
I like will be in Caroline's side

175
00:09:29,139 --> 00:09:31,139
every step of the way.

176
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:34,139
Make sure it's still clear of her.

177
00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:36,779
And what are you going to do?

178
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:38,779
Let's say our girl will be in trouble.

179
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:53,620
I want her dead.

180
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,509
How are you?

181
00:09:55,509 --> 00:09:56,509
Help.

182
00:09:56,509 --> 00:10:00,779
Oh my God.

183
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:17,980
I'm a shitty consensus.

184
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:25,470
Hunter.

185
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:36,080
Up into her.

186
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,610
Who are you?

187
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:40,610
Don't worry.

188
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:41,610
I'm also Hunter.

189
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:42,610
Hunter cleans her.

190
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:44,250
What are you doing here?

191
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,250
Shit.

192
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:48,250
He looks like he doesn't know I'm a hybrid.

193
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:50,250
I gotta make something up.

194
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:53,500
I'm just a rock.

195
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:58,230
My whole family was killed by the werewolves.

196
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:02,330
And I heard that Hunter started war with them.

197
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:04,330
Is it the truth?

198
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,330
It's been temporary truths,

199
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:08,330
but you've never seen I twice one another.

200
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:13,539
In fact, I'm just a root out of any trade

201
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:14,539
as to the hunters.

202
00:11:14,539 --> 00:11:16,539
To revenge.

203
00:11:16,539 --> 00:11:17,899
For my parents.

204
00:11:17,899 --> 00:11:19,899
This of the hands of Gunnar.

205
00:11:19,899 --> 00:11:20,899
Our pet.

206
00:11:20,899 --> 00:11:24,299
What's wrong?

207
00:11:24,299 --> 00:11:26,360
I'm sorry for your loss.

208
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:35,980
Let's hope I get out of this in one piece.

209
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:44,259
Airlines in trouble.

210
00:11:44,259 --> 00:11:48,539
I can only go around the grey mountain to get to her.

211
00:11:48,539 --> 00:11:56,740
How are you there?

212
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:00,779
A werewolf sense is coming back.

213
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:02,620
You smell that?

214
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:05,929
It's a werewolf sense.

215
00:12:05,929 --> 00:12:15,100
Smells something rotten in here.

216
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:20,120
Maybe it's cause I bring the dish earlier.

217
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,700
Sit down.

218
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:26,580
It's me.

219
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:40,059
This has been a long day.

220
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:44,309
Stress gives you illusion

221
00:12:44,309 --> 00:12:47,210
that where I was might be.

222
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:57,690
Everywhere.

223
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:58,690
I wish you well.

224
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:01,330
But hopefully,

225
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:03,460
we'll never have to see each other again.

226
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:45,840
Fall into my trap.

227
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,840
Everyone you think that you die in the grey mountain.

228
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,100
But lead the unknown.

229
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:57,129
Where did all the kids do, huh?

230
00:13:57,129 --> 00:13:58,129
Here?

231
00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:16,159
I'm not gonna force you.

232
00:14:19,049 --> 00:14:21,049
You're going to be running to me.

233
00:14:21,049 --> 00:14:22,049
sooner or later,

234
00:14:22,049 --> 00:14:23,049
with an open arms.

235
00:14:23,049 --> 00:14:31,580
We know stresses of Miss Caroline.

236
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,580
It doesn't look good.

237
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,659
This bitch was trying something.

238
00:14:35,659 --> 00:14:36,659
What do you mean, son?

239
00:14:36,659 --> 00:14:38,179
Bestly!

240
00:14:38,179 --> 00:14:40,179
She was not going to be before I left the compound.

241
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:43,179
She must have been answered to Jacob.

242
00:14:43,179 --> 00:14:44,179
We didn't fight him.

243
00:14:44,179 --> 00:14:54,889
I don't feel like Jacob Caroline.

244
00:14:54,889 --> 00:14:57,340
He's your mate.

245
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:59,340
How am I supposed to like him?

246
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:01,340
He's just that apple rotten to the core.

247
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:04,340
But being with your mate is your calling.

248
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:07,980
Why don't you want to answer your faith, Caroline?

249
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:11,840
Don't you want to stay with bloody moons?

250
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,840
It doesn't mean that I have to obey to bullets.

251
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,899
I've been doing that for my whole life.

252
00:15:17,899 --> 00:15:22,759
You don't have to obey.

253
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:25,759
You just have to understand how to approach him.

254
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:29,110
You reminded me of something.

255
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:31,110
If I want to make her on for it,

256
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:50,110
then he has to let his guard down.

257
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:52,110
I thought you hated me.

258
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:57,679
It doesn't mean I'm going to be a side while you're bleeding.

259
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:15,220
Oh, Caroline, why'd you save me and hurt me at the same time?

260
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:18,429
What am I going to do to you?

261
00:16:18,429 --> 00:16:27,950
You weak now.

262
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:33,990
Do you think that men can save you?

263
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:34,990
Get over here.

264
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:48,379
You know what you did.

265
00:16:48,379 --> 00:16:49,379
Do you?

266
00:16:49,379 --> 00:16:53,379
You may pass a nag enough to me because you're trying to take care of it, right?

267
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:54,379
Oh, really?

268
00:16:54,379 --> 00:16:55,379
What you're going to do?

269
00:16:55,379 --> 00:16:57,379
I'm going to do this place upside down.

270
00:16:57,379 --> 00:17:00,340
But that's why I'm not cool.

271
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:02,340
Not the Alpha yet.

272
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:05,339
To search my place, you need to bring more men.

273
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:06,339
I dare you.

274
00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:07,339
Even better.

275
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:09,630
Bring the Alpha.

276
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:10,630
Wait here.

277
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,630
You did shit.

278
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:40,960
Are you trying to start warmly free or something?

279
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,960
Maybe you think I must come back trying to overthrow Alpha Gordon.

280
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,539
But my family was once the strong and powerful.

281
00:17:49,539 --> 00:17:54,539
If it weren't for the hunters who murdered them, I could have been the Alpha anytime.

282
00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:57,539
Do you think you can just murder your way to the top?

283
00:17:57,539 --> 00:17:59,299
Why not?

284
00:17:59,299 --> 00:18:01,299
I will be the most powerful Alpha.

285
00:18:01,299 --> 00:18:03,299
Bloody moon has everything.

286
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:08,339
And you will kneel before me and forget about that weak boy.

287
00:18:08,339 --> 00:18:12,490
Alec, I'm the strongest.

288
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:14,490
Alec is not weak.

289
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:16,839
He's so much better than me.

290
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:20,509
He doesn't teach women like you are doing now.

291
00:18:20,509 --> 00:18:26,829
It beats you much.

292
00:18:26,829 --> 00:18:40,430
When I tear Alec into pieces.

293
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:44,740
Where are you, Caroline?

294
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:51,220
Even if we are not meant to be together, I'm still thinking about you, Alec.

295
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:58,660
Down up here.

296
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:01,660
Your boss brother will crush me big to you this day.

297
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:04,660
I will just come a week like ants.

298
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:11,490
I crush them many times.

299
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:16,430
The weak of you is going.

300
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:19,460
Tearing you both apart won't cause me a thing.

301
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:22,970
I dare you.

302
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:36,839
What the fuck you guys doing?

303
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:42,900
I have to teach you how to fight, huh?

304
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:48,130
I don't need it.

305
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:51,289
I have my silver blood ready to go.

306
00:19:51,289 --> 00:19:54,480
Aren't you afraid?

307
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,480
Bleeding to death.

308
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:59,619
Listen.

309
00:19:59,619 --> 00:20:03,619
Precision and strength are both important.

310
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:05,519
I will try.

311
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:07,519
I'm not going to do it this way.

312
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:11,500
It's your turn.

313
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,500
Do it.

314
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:25,950
You be my mate.

315
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:28,079
You have to act like one.

316
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:32,059
From now on.

317
00:20:32,059 --> 00:20:36,579
Whoever dared to touch her will be sentenced to death.

318
00:20:36,579 --> 00:20:38,579
Regardless who you are.

319
00:20:38,579 --> 00:20:41,119
Consider yourself warned.

320
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:45,339
She's fucking crazy.

321
00:20:45,339 --> 00:20:48,589
I have to get out of here.

322
00:20:48,589 --> 00:21:02,529
How do I get out of here?

323
00:21:02,529 --> 00:21:04,529
Why are you still alive?

324
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:07,839
You want to try and take me out?

325
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:10,319
Dare you talk back to me.

326
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:15,339
Guard send her to the dungeon.

327
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,099
What?

328
00:21:19,099 --> 00:21:21,099
Jacob said nobody touches Carlisle.

329
00:21:21,099 --> 00:21:25,779
For me.

330
00:21:25,779 --> 00:21:31,069
And I'm telling you to drag her to the dungeon.

331
00:21:31,069 --> 00:21:35,680
The last guy who touched her is dead.

332
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:40,589
I'm going to get rid of the guy.

333
00:21:40,589 --> 00:21:43,880
But he keeps clenching onto me.

334
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,880
Well, why don't you just reject him as your mate?

335
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,880
Your mate can be rejected.

336
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,880
Well, yes.

337
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,039
Go on.

338
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:52,039
Try it.

339
00:21:52,039 --> 00:21:53,039
What are you waiting for?

340
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,039
You're going to reject him.

341
00:21:54,039 --> 00:21:56,039
He's going to kill me on the spot.

342
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:59,039
I guess you're not as dumb as I thought you were.

343
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,039
Here is a better idea.

344
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:03,039
Why didn't you let me out?

345
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:07,039
And I'm going to be out of your way.

346
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:11,319
You can have Jacob all you want.

347
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:13,319
I'm going to be here to get out of here.

348
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:14,319
Tramp.

349
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:19,470
Basically, it's definitely my best chance of getting out of here.

350
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:22,470
I have to find a way to spark her jealousy.

351
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:28,599
Me.

352
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:29,599
Me.

353
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:33,559
In the dining room tomorrow.

354
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:36,690
There is a surprise for you.

355
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:40,150
Jay.

356
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:44,779
Get that hybrid out of here.

357
00:22:44,779 --> 00:22:48,140
And I'm not sharing my alphabet with any.

358
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:50,140
You don't get to tell me what to do.

359
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:52,140
Behave yourself.

360
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:55,329
You're nothing but a she move.

361
00:22:55,329 --> 00:22:57,329
You do as you're told to do.

362
00:22:57,329 --> 00:23:02,930
Now, tell me where we are yet with the weapons.

363
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:03,930
You're going to regret it.

364
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:06,930
If you don't do it, as I told you to.

365
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:12,380
You'd be too apt to do.

366
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:16,380
I can't wait to chop her head off once it becomes a new alphabet.

367
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:25,140
How spun the weapons delivery.

368
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:28,140
Jacob is going to tread on my dignity.

369
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:31,140
And I guess I'm just going to have to teach him a lesson.

370
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:33,140
I believe this letter is for you, Mom.

371
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:42,759
Come begging for me now.

372
00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:48,349
I guess it's time for an apology.

373
00:23:48,349 --> 00:23:51,349
Happy birthday to you.

374
00:23:52,349 --> 00:23:55,890
Happy birthday to you.

375
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:56,890
What is this?

376
00:23:56,890 --> 00:23:59,619
This is a birthday cake.

377
00:23:59,619 --> 00:24:02,170
I picked it just for you.

378
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:04,170
I don't do birthdays.

379
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:06,329
Those are for the week.

380
00:24:06,329 --> 00:24:07,329
Come on Jacob.

381
00:24:07,329 --> 00:24:08,329
Listen up.

382
00:24:08,329 --> 00:24:11,329
I know that your parents are never here on your birthdays.

383
00:24:11,329 --> 00:24:15,380
So if you can consider this a special treat.

384
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:23,390
I even cut my hand when I was baking this cake for you.

385
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:25,869
Why are you so silly?

386
00:24:25,869 --> 00:24:27,869
Wasting your time doing those things.

387
00:24:27,869 --> 00:24:30,160
Are you going to take a look for me?

388
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:34,089
Why is Paisley still not here?

389
00:24:34,089 --> 00:24:42,809
What the fuck?

390
00:24:42,809 --> 00:24:43,809
How dare you?

391
00:24:43,809 --> 00:24:47,190
No one lays a finger on me.

392
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:51,180
Jacob, everything happens the first time.

393
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:54,589
I've got to clean up for you.

394
00:24:54,589 --> 00:25:05,779
I'm going to make them pay.
