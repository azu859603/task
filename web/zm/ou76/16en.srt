1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,080
You're going to the dungeon.

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,080
I think you can get rid of me now, huh?

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:08,080
I'd say you need me now more than ever.

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,080
This rebellion has failed even before it started.

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,619
Weapons can be bought.

6
00:00:13,619 --> 00:00:15,619
Men can be bought.

7
00:00:15,619 --> 00:00:16,620
But this...

8
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:19,100
...is camp.

9
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,100
Enough with it. Go in.

10
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,190
Well then.

11
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:24,480
Waiting on you.

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,960
My opera.

13
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,960
It's time to draw up a plan.

14
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:36,619
Done yet.

15
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:39,100
Haven't seen you in a while.

16
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,579
I've been busy hopelessly.

17
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:43,579
Now that you have more time,

18
00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:49,850
I think it's time to talk about some unfinished business.

19
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:52,939
I got your good luck charm.

20
00:00:52,939 --> 00:01:02,780
I miss your Caroline.

21
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:05,909
If only I was stronger.

22
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:07,909
You have never been hurt because of me.

23
00:01:07,909 --> 00:01:09,909
See Lee Hunty?

24
00:01:09,909 --> 00:01:15,859
Protecting you is my duty.

25
00:01:15,859 --> 00:01:17,859
You don't need to change anything.

26
00:01:17,859 --> 00:01:22,140
I will become stronger, but always protect you.

27
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,299
Can you teach me some self-defense moves?

28
00:01:25,299 --> 00:01:27,939
I want to fight alongside you.

29
00:01:27,939 --> 00:01:29,939
I don't want to be a burden.

30
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:32,030
As long as you want,

31
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:35,090
and as long as I know,

32
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:37,090
I will teach you whatever I have.
