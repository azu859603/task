00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.599
Rest well. I'm gonna head back first.

2
00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:11.060
I'll wait until the day you open up to me.

3
00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:20.050
Caroline. Caroline, wait.

4
00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.559
You should rest up on your wounds. I don't want to disturb you.

5
00:00:23.559 --> 00:00:33.179
My wound is all healed up. I thought you said you want to learn how to defend yourself. I can't eat you now.

6
00:00:33.179 --> 00:00:37.179
He literally makes it so hard for me to reject it.

7
00:00:37.179 --> 00:00:56.140
Now you're trapped.

8
00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.140
He's I certain too captivating.

9
00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:08.569
That was a good one.

10
00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:10.569
That's enough for you for today.

11
00:01:10.569 --> 00:01:15.489
Caroline, why are you dodging me? Do you hate me or something?

12
00:01:15.489 --> 00:01:22.170
You've got to walk all crossed.

13
00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:29.780
No ghost Caroline. He cannot fall for him.
