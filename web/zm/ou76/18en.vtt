00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:06.820
You've been avoiding my way too many times Caroline. Tell me. What's in your mind?

2
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.509
You have to start communicating Caroline. I don't think I deserve this.

3
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.509
Do you want to know?

4
00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:17.660
Fine.

5
00:00:18.489 --> 00:00:20.329
I like you, Alec.

6
00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:22.329
But I'm Gordon's daughter

7
00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.370
and you're his son.

8
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.370
Pisty you never told me about that.

9
00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:29.820
Hold on.

10
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.710
So you do like me?

11
00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.710
Yes, of course.

12
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.740
I think that's all I need to do.

13
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.340
You should have told me about it before.

14
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.340
Yeah, you keep trying to stay close to me.

15
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.320
We're never going to get together.

16
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.929
Hold away.

17
00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:55.329
I'm sorry Caroline.

18
00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:57.329
Since the very first day I met you,

19
00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.490
I knew there was something.

20
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.380
I don't like you.

21
00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.379
I love you.
