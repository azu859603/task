1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,599
No, we cannot do that.

2
00:00:06,599 --> 00:00:12,460
You're like, look at me. I'm foster. Gordon is not my biological father.

3
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:20,339
We're not glad. We can be together. We've come a long way.

4
00:00:20,339 --> 00:00:24,539
I know there are certain things I didn't explain myself clearly.

5
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:29,839
But not again. A promise.

6
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:35,899
Whatever trouble it is, we're gonna weather through it like a power combo.

7
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:37,899
That's such a 90s expression.

8
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:40,250
Hey, you can call me old school.

9
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:58,829
I can keep the ball rolling.

10
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:06,799
Father, I have news for you. We're together.

11
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,459
Congratulations. I think I saw that coming.

12
00:01:11,459 --> 00:01:17,000
Wait. Hold on a second. Where is Mom?
