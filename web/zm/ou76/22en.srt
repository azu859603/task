1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:14,179
I wanted to give you this, this sword has been with me for many years, it's got me out

2
00:00:14,179 --> 00:00:39,890
of numerous tough fights, you know, if I had known you two were still alive, I'm so proud

3
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:44,450
you had the courage to venture out into the unknown to find you seriously.

4
00:00:44,450 --> 00:01:08,829
You're so powerful, just don't listen to those fools that would despise you.

5
00:01:08,829 --> 00:01:10,829
As a father, I would wish for.

6
00:01:10,829 --> 00:01:28,980
You find Jacob. You and Algwick. As for your mother, leave her with me.

7
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:29,980
I see you soon, Dad.

8
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:39,579
Why didn't you tell her the truth, my Alpha?
