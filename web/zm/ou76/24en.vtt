00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:13.910
Alpha Gordon, how dare you, trespass into our territory, are you declaring war on the hunters?

2
00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.519
No, I'm here as a civilian, I'm here to collect my luck, Esther.

3
00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:22.519
She's a hunter and she's my daughter.

4
00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:31.550
It's because of your existence that she and my granddaughter are exiled for more than a decade.

5
00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.579
Believe me when I say, I'll do anything.

6
00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:38.579
And now, if you want to see her, you have to go through me.

7
00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.350
Very well.

8
00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:49.060
Do you grab it all, man? I should have just stayed home.

9
00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.700
I got this, my king.

10
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:57.700
Don't kill him. We don't want to start a war with the bloody moon, Daniel.

11
00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.700
Lock him in the dungeon.

12
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.960
I want to see my history one more time.

13
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.959
Granted, lock him up with her.

14
00:01:05.959 --> 00:01:11.540
Your sentencing will be announced soon.

15
00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:19.700
Why didn't we just kill him here, right now, Daniel?

16
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.980
If Gordon and Esther are both here, then their hybrid must be closed.

17
00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.019
We'll take care of all of them and she's here.
