1
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:07,120
Oh my gosh. They broke your head. What are you doing here?

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,119
I'm gonna save you.

3
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:13,609
How's Caroline?

4
00:00:13,609 --> 00:00:15,830
Caroline is getting stronger than ever now.

5
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:20,050
Alec is the new alpha, and they're in love with each other.

6
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:25,050
Glad to hear that. You shouldn't have come. You should have just stayed home.

7
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:28,589
I had to. I lost you once I'm not losing you again.

8
00:00:28,589 --> 00:00:33,590
All those years ago, you were separated by the rivalries of Hunter and werewolf,

9
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:36,590
bound by the identities of Hunter Princess and Alpha.

10
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:38,590
Others are in our love.

11
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:54,899
I wonder what my father is.

12
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:56,899
He's had the hunters. What?

13
00:00:56,899 --> 00:00:58,320
What?

14
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:04,579
Your mother got taken by Daniel Merck, and he went to save her.

15
00:01:04,579 --> 00:01:08,930
But why did he go alone? He should have brought all of us.

16
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:13,120
He wanted to step down so quickly, because he wanted to save her,

17
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:17,180
and doesn't provoke a full war at the same time.

18
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:22,109
Indeed. But he's very weak.

19
00:01:22,109 --> 00:01:25,109
He's been pushing himself all this time.

20
00:01:25,109 --> 00:01:31,269
And though he warned me many times to not tell you guys,

21
00:01:31,269 --> 00:01:35,459
Alpha, Alec, please go to save him.

22
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:36,459
I have to go.
