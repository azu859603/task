1
00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:02.290
Then I'm coming with you.

2
00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:06.509
If you're going to come with me, it's going to defeat Father's intention.

3
00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.689
Alpha, like, cannot be in this fight.

4
00:00:10.689 --> 00:00:13.609
I won't let Kiroland be in any danger.

5
00:00:13.609 --> 00:00:18.199
I swear to be by her sight, always.

6
00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:19.800
There's no need to argue.

7
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.320
Just listen to me.

8
00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.109
Then we better get going.

9
00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:29.019
As the new Alpha is finally here,

10
00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:34.060
it's the bloody moon officially declaring war on the hunters.

11
00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:41.689
As the new Alpha, I've come to negotiate with the hunter about the wolf hunter coexistence.

12
00:00:41.689 --> 00:00:45.450
My personal visit here represents a sincerity of our claim.

13
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.530
And you?

14
00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.810
I'm here for my mother and my father.

15
00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:51.409
I'm not going to lie.

16
00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:55.369
You do look like your mother and your grandmother.

17
00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:58.409
They tried hard to save you.

18
00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:00.939
I know that.

19
00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:05.099
That's why I'm not going to leave without my parents.

20
00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.379
Exactly what your father said.

21
00:01:07.379 --> 00:01:08.859
I'll tell you what.

22
00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:12.219
We have a written rule in the hunter tribe.

23
00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:19.099
If a descendant can defeat the current king, they can become leader of the hunter.

24
00:01:19.099 --> 00:01:22.819
Do you accept this challenge?

25
00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:24.980
Yes, I do.

26
00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.670
Permission to fight on your place, my king.

27
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.310
I should have now be aware of how you live.

28
00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.750
You are so dead for taking my mother.
