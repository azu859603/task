1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,299
Oh, Dad!

2
00:00:04,299 --> 00:00:06,299
Caroline, help him!

3
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:08,339
I've been thinking.

4
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:10,339
No, I am the queen of the hunters.

5
00:00:10,339 --> 00:00:12,339
She did it.

6
00:00:12,339 --> 00:00:14,339
I can't believe it, Caroline.

7
00:00:14,339 --> 00:00:17,899
You did what we all failed to do.

8
00:00:17,899 --> 00:00:25,890
Let's get you out of here.

9
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:27,890
What do you want us to do with him, Mike Green?

10
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:29,890
It wasn't all a lie.

11
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:33,649
Our mom is in forest.

12
00:00:33,649 --> 00:00:36,649
I already knew that you were after me that time.

13
00:00:36,649 --> 00:00:38,649
So you think you're a flower, huh?

14
00:00:38,649 --> 00:00:41,740
You're using me and playing me.

15
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:44,030
You're doing yourself much.

16
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:46,799
I'm done with you.

17
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:47,799
Lock him up.

18
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:53,200
I don't want to hear another work with him.

19
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,579
What did he do to you?

20
00:00:55,579 --> 00:00:56,810
Nothing.

21
00:00:56,810 --> 00:01:00,420
He gets my hand to you and shrugs the crowd.

22
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,799
No, it's not that, really.

23
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:08,569
He saved me from a fall and took care of me for one day.

24
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:09,569
And another one.

25
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:13,569
But I didn't know who he was after I realized

26
00:01:13,569 --> 00:01:16,569
that he was actually hunting for me.

27
00:01:16,569 --> 00:01:18,569
Escaped immediately.

28
00:01:18,569 --> 00:01:20,659
I'm using some tricks.

29
00:01:20,659 --> 00:01:23,299
Tricks?

30
00:01:23,299 --> 00:01:24,299
Okay.

31
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:25,299
Don't believe me?
