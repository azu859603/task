1
00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:04.290
I was wondering where you guys are.

2
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.689
I got your message. What's the plan?

3
00:00:09.689 --> 00:00:12.720
Depends on what the objective is.

4
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.070
You want to kill Caroline and Gordon?

5
00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.070
I want to take back Bloody Moon.

6
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.460
Why can you supply us?

7
00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.620
I know they see the daggers hidden somewhere.

8
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.809
This can't be useful for killing its werewolves.

9
00:00:26.809 --> 00:00:27.809
Good.

10
00:00:27.809 --> 00:00:31.000
I really only believe when I see the weapons.

11
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:42.960
We better not miss with the second shot.

12
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.960
Ask your family to be honest and bye.

13
00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.560
For what?

14
00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:53.689
Once I kill Alec, I will kill Daniel and the hunters as well.

15
00:00:53.689 --> 00:01:02.500
There's my beautiful daughter.

16
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.920
Stress will look amazing on you.

17
00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:16.379
So, don't you guys have in me?

18
00:01:16.379 --> 00:01:19.269
No, of course not.

19
00:01:19.269 --> 00:01:20.269
Never.

20
00:01:20.269 --> 00:01:27.390
These past 18 years, I was so strict with you because I was afraid you would be hurt.

21
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.000
I'm so sorry that I gave you an unhappy childhood.

22
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:43.790
Of course, Mom.

23
00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:49.939
I also hope that you can forgive me for my stubbornness back then.

24
00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:55.340
After asking me to forgive you.

25
00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.340
You have my unconditional love and eternal support.

26
00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:23.099
Missing me much?

27
00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:31.009
How dare you reject the werewolf tradition of Caroline?

28
00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:34.740
You are supposed to be with your mate.

29
00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:39.189
I can do whatever the hell I want.

30
00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:43.189
The new goddess will never forgive you for that.

31
00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:44.189
Enough.

32
00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:49.629
I'm your host and I don't answer to you.

33
00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:51.729
You listen to me.

34
00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:58.819
Yes, Caroline.

35
00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:06.360
Today, we are here to witness an unprecedented region of our worlds.

36
00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.520
Hunters and werewolves are together.

37
00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.870
Under the moon goddess.

38
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:19.870
We celebrate our peace and prosperity and hopes for eternity to come.

39
00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:26.030
All thanks to Caroline Arpad and Alec Hall.

40
00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:41.300
For now, with the power instilled in me, I am presenting to you Alpha Alec and Luna Caroline.

41
00:03:41.300 --> 00:05:28.329
Together and rejoice.

42
00:05:28.329 --> 00:05:29.329
Not looking good.

43
00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:31.329
We are down to a few men.

44
00:05:31.329 --> 00:05:33.329
We have to fight this out.

45
00:05:33.329 --> 00:05:36.519
Alec, it's pretty much down for her.

46
00:05:36.519 --> 00:05:38.519
Come on, let's hit goal.

47
00:05:38.519 --> 00:06:00.069
I can't lose again.

48
00:06:00.069 --> 00:06:02.069
I'm afraid there's nothing I can do.

49
00:06:02.069 --> 00:06:10.160
Both cats are poisonous.

50
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:15.160
Even if the one can close, the poison is already in his bloodstream.

51
00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:40.000
My peace.

52
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:50.870
I now give the power of my soul.

53
00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:54.720
Love you.

54
00:06:54.720 --> 00:07:10.339
Love you Caroline.

55
00:07:10.339 --> 00:07:12.910
Take care.

56
00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:16.819
I stop breathing.

57
00:07:16.819 --> 00:07:17.819
See Lee Hunty?

58
00:07:17.819 --> 00:07:21.220
As long as you want.

59
00:07:21.220 --> 00:08:02.279
And as long as I know, I will teach you whatever I have.

60
00:08:02.279 --> 00:08:05.569
Run away when you had a chance.

61
00:08:05.569 --> 00:08:07.569
I couldn't leave behind my favorite Hunty.

62
00:08:07.569 --> 00:08:14.560
I see that you captured the knife.

63
00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:19.610
I've been saving for the right moment.

64
00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:21.180
I'm flattered.

65
00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:23.180
Is Alec dead finally?

66
00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:26.949
You could make me deal Alpha.

67
00:08:26.949 --> 00:08:27.949
You know?

68
00:08:27.949 --> 00:08:30.949
And then we finally fulfill our destiny.

69
00:08:30.949 --> 00:08:45.379
But your dreams become so strong.

70
00:08:45.379 --> 00:08:49.929
Just as I hope, we are meant to be together.

71
00:08:49.929 --> 00:08:53.980
You can deny it.

72
00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:57.190
You can't be strong.

73
00:08:57.190 --> 00:09:00.730
Because of Alec.

74
00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:05.690
You can condemn you into the hell for the injured.

75
00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:20.120
That day, you made that cake for me.

76
00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:26.129
It was the best thing of my life.

77
00:09:26.129 --> 00:09:28.129
Happy birthday to you.

78
00:09:28.129 --> 00:09:50.220
Happy birthday to you.

79
00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:57.279
Did you help something for me?

80
00:09:57.279 --> 00:10:19.889
I will kill this sister myself.

81
00:10:19.889 --> 00:10:21.940
Ask her.

82
00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:24.039
You traitor.

83
00:10:24.039 --> 00:10:27.070
I killed Gordon by my arm.

84
00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:35.059
Your traitor as well.

85
00:10:35.059 --> 00:10:38.879
Your hunter please.

86
00:10:38.879 --> 00:10:41.879
Yeah, associate yourself with the rock werewolves.

87
00:10:41.879 --> 00:10:45.419
What?

88
00:10:45.419 --> 00:10:47.419
Just washing your surfer.

89
00:10:47.419 --> 00:10:49.419
Brings me joy.

90
00:10:49.419 --> 00:10:53.360
What Daniel?

91
00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:57.570
I'm not going to kill you.

92
00:10:57.570 --> 00:10:58.980
Why not?

93
00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:00.980
It's because I saved you before.

94
00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:12.909
From now onwards, you are not allowed to step into either hunters or werewolves' territories.

95
00:11:12.909 --> 00:11:34.490
You are going to be stripped of your hunters' power and banished as a mortal.

96
00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:36.490
All your powers.

97
00:11:38.159 --> 00:11:39.860
Take.

98
00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:41.860
They say never save you.

99
00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:44.470
We ran back to the forest.

100
00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:50.600
We hunters.

101
00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:53.600
We have provisions coming in on Wednesday.

102
00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:57.970
And everything is scheduled.

103
00:11:57.970 --> 00:12:00.159
Same thing on the bloody one.

104
00:12:00.159 --> 00:12:03.480
We are now sharing resources with the hunters.

105
00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:17.399
Do you have any additional directive for us by Alpha?

106
00:12:17.399 --> 00:12:19.720
Yes, what we were saying.

107
00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:25.700
We are wondering if you have any other orders for us.

108
00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:28.080
But we were all.

109
00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.139
You dismissed.

110
00:12:29.139 --> 00:12:44.779
What's going on?

111
00:12:44.779 --> 00:12:46.990
My Alpha.

112
00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:51.409
There was a baby boy that was delivered a couple days ago.

113
00:12:51.409 --> 00:12:54.629
He amazingly grew up in just one day.

114
00:12:54.629 --> 00:12:57.889
We all think he looks a lot like him.

115
00:12:57.889 --> 00:13:00.360
Say it.

116
00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:01.360
Him.

117
00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:03.779
Take me to him.

118
00:13:03.779 --> 00:13:04.779
His mouth.

119
00:13:04.779 --> 00:13:07.860
The boy is over there.
