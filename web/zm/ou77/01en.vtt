00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:16.160
Your father told me we'll work on me, Ray.

2
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.160
Blake, if you would draw your forces now, we're done for.

3
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.160
The Sakeens fight is advancing as we speak.

4
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.160
What do you want me to do, Meg?

5
00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.160
Your daughter betrayed me.

6
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.160
You betrayed me.

7
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.899
What will I help you?

8
00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:29.899
Link, please don't abandon us.

9
00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:32.899
Ben, he's the one who abandoned you, not me.

10
00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:35.899
I will not lose any more of my men, so bullshit props,

11
00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:36.899
they don't believe it.

12
00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:37.899
What about my men?

13
00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:39.920
Isn't there none, Mike?

14
00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:46.689
Oh, you must go to New York.

15
00:00:46.689 --> 00:00:48.689
We'll stay with the Azerellos, you'll be safe there.

16
00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:51.689
You must never let anybody know who you really are,

17
00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:54.689
and you must never allow your wolf to take hold.

18
00:00:54.689 --> 00:00:55.689
Do you understand?

19
00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:56.689
I'm not going anywhere.

20
00:00:56.689 --> 00:01:01.689
The Sakeens pride will stop attacking us if we no longer have what they're after.

21
00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:03.689
I'll stay with the bank. I'm not leaving.

22
00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:05.099
Jack the Royal!

23
00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:07.099
Your brother will take you, but you have to go now.

24
00:01:07.099 --> 00:01:08.099
I said go!

25
00:01:08.099 --> 00:01:09.099
No!

26
00:01:09.099 --> 00:01:11.670
No!

27
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:12.670
You're the company.

28
00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:13.670
Shit.

29
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:14.670
It's an alpha.

30
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:15.670
You need to go.

31
00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:16.670
God's sake!

32
00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.670
Will your father stop treating me like a child?

33
00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:19.670
I can fight!

34
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:20.670
Let me fight!

35
00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:21.670
For once!

36
00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:22.670
Just do a little.

37
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:23.670
Go!
