00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:33.259
You're here and that's all the matters.

2
00:00:33.259 --> 00:00:38.259
Anyway, Natalia, tell me, did you hear from your cousin?

3
00:00:38.259 --> 00:00:39.259
I did.

4
00:00:39.259 --> 00:00:40.259
He called me the other day actually.

5
00:00:40.259 --> 00:00:42.579
He wants me to come home.

6
00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:45.579
Well, I wasn't expecting that.

7
00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:48.579
He must have a good reason to ask you to come home.

8
00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:51.780
Even all that happened two years ago.

9
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.740
There's a new army in California.

10
00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.770
Apparently, they called themselves outcasts.

11
00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.770
They're snapping up territory like it's a game of monopoly,

12
00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.769
and they're certainly giving Blake Hunter a lot for his money.

13
00:01:06.769 --> 00:01:09.769
I wish people would stop saying his name.

14
00:01:09.769 --> 00:01:11.769
It makes me want to puke.

15
00:01:11.769 --> 00:01:13.950
He's getting better.

16
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.950
But you know, he wants me to marry this guy.

17
00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.950
Blake Hunter.

18
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.500
Well, I'll tell you one thing for a damn sure.

19
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.500
The Blake Hunter's always wanted to get his bloody hands on that moon-howlers pack.

20
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.159
What can we do to help, sweetie?

21
00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.159
I think it's time to let her out.

22
00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:38.379
My move.

23
00:01:38.379 --> 00:01:47.900
Summon you, Leah.

24
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.000
Come forth!
