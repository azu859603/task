1
00:00:02,509 --> 00:00:04,509
With the company girl

2
00:00:04,509 --> 00:00:06,509
Emma, I'll call you back

3
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:10,619
What do you want?

4
00:00:10,619 --> 00:00:11,619
You're a bitch

5
00:00:11,619 --> 00:00:12,619
You should be very careful

6
00:00:12,619 --> 00:00:14,619
You call in a bitch

7
00:00:14,619 --> 00:00:17,620
You should be careful with that pretty little mouth of yours

8
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,620
You're catching trouble

9
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,620
I ain't afraid to hit a little girl

10
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:30,839
I told you

11
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:32,840
Be careful how you call in a bitch

12
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:33,840
Bitch

13
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,840
I could have handled that, you know?

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,159
It'll be too easy

15
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:41,439
What's the fan on that?

16
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:42,439
Tonight

17
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:45,439
The biggest ballast advocate

18
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:47,439
In all of New York City

19
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:49,539
For us

20
00:00:49,539 --> 00:00:51,539
You know, I couldn't have won this case today

21
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:52,539
If it wasn't for you

22
00:00:52,539 --> 00:00:56,460
You are my family

23
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:03,399
Would you like some more red wine to go with the chains?

24
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:04,659
Um

25
00:01:04,659 --> 00:01:06,659
Excuse me, Emma, just one sec

26
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:09,299
You should answer that

27
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:11,299
You haven't spoke to him in two years

28
00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:12,299
It's time

29
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:17,099
Day
