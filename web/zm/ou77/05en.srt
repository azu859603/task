1
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:16,420
You coming in?

2
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:20,059
So Blake, guess what?

3
00:00:20,059 --> 00:00:21,600
What?

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,980
God of the cold with Natalia.

5
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:24,980
And?

6
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:28,980
And she's just a damn little kid

7
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,210
because she's so stuck up on her new life in New York.

8
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,210
She's not even thinking about going back into our work.

9
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,210
I was just thinking, you know?

10
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:43,689
This might be the right time of you choosing your true owner.

11
00:00:43,689 --> 00:00:46,009
Who do you think I should choose?

12
00:00:46,009 --> 00:00:47,009
You.

13
00:00:47,009 --> 00:00:48,039
Why not?

14
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:52,039
We've been doing this thing for a while now, and it's good.

15
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:58,039
You really think that I would choose a sad, orphaned little witch?

16
00:00:58,039 --> 00:00:59,039
Stick to your job.

17
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,039
You're such a dick sometimes, you know?

18
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,040
Yeah, and you like that dick, don't you?

19
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:10,959
It's about Alfred Ray White's down there in your office waiting for you.

20
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:11,959
He's still alive?

21
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:12,959
What does he want?

22
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:14,959
He says I'll only talk to you.

23
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:16,280
Okay, tell him I'll be five.

24
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,280
All right.

25
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,870
I can't do it.

26
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:22,969
I won't do it.

27
00:01:22,969 --> 00:01:24,969
You're not in position to bargain a woman.

28
00:01:24,969 --> 00:01:25,969
These are my terms.

29
00:01:25,969 --> 00:01:28,969
And without me, your pack would be wiped out.

30
00:01:28,969 --> 00:01:33,969
The moon howler survived ten years ago because I sent my daughters away.

31
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:37,969
If I bring her back, old wars will start anew.

32
00:01:37,969 --> 00:01:44,689
No one believes in the white wolf myth anymore.

33
00:01:44,689 --> 00:01:45,780
All moved on.

34
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,780
You should too.

35
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:51,349
I don't think you understand, Blake.

36
00:01:51,349 --> 00:01:55,859
If this new army, the outcast says they're calling themselves.

37
00:01:55,859 --> 00:02:00,859
If they take out the moon howlers, who do you think is next on their list?

38
00:02:00,859 --> 00:02:02,859
It's you.

39
00:02:02,859 --> 00:02:06,599
We're the dark stone moon pack, the biggest in California.

40
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:08,599
You really think they can stand up against us?

41
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:12,879
Haven't seen this clan, Blake.

42
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:13,879
I have.

43
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:15,879
I fought against them and I barely survived.

44
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:16,879
You know why?

45
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:17,879
Why?

46
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:20,879
Because for some reason, they allowed me to.

47
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:27,199
These are my terms, right?

48
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:28,199
Taking my living.
