00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.929
Fine, asking her to do this is one thing, but getting her to agree?

2
00:00:05.929 --> 00:00:11.939
Well, I'd have a better chance of taking out the outcast single-handedly.

3
00:00:11.939 --> 00:00:19.929
Leave that meal, man.

4
00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:28.609
You should answer that. You haven't spoke to him in two years. It's time.

5
00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:29.609
Daddy?

6
00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:37.549
No, it's me. Hello, little wolf. What's wrong? Can't I get a ton, little wolf?

7
00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:42.240
Say something. Not anything. Where's my father?

8
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.240
He's here.

9
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.000
Let me talk to him.

10
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.500
Nope.

11
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.500
You can't do that.

12
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.100
What do you want?

13
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.210
I didn't tell you.

14
00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.710
He sold you off from my protection.

15
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:53.710
You're mine now.

16
00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.380
It's not like that, Blake.

17
00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.090
Over my dead body.

18
00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.090
Let me speak with my daughter.

19
00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.060
To speak with him, he did send you away.

20
00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:10.060
He told everybody you were dead. And if I'm right, he hasn't tried to talk to you since.

21
00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:16.480
Just put him on the phone.

22
00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.859
Nat.

23
00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:20.859
It was happening. What are you doing with him?

24
00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:25.079
You've been it gone a long time, Nat. Things have changed.

25
00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:29.079
There's a new army on their eyes. They call themselves the outcasts.

26
00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:32.920
They're powerful. Determined.

27
00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.920
We're coming under constant attack as they close in on our territory.

28
00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.030
I have no choice. Out to marry.

29
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:48.659
Is he joking?

30
00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.659
You mean I must marry a man who abandoned us?

31
00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.659
Who tore apart our alliance when we needed him the most?

32
00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:57.659
No. Thank you.

33
00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:58.659
Tell ya.

34
00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:02.159
Didn't take me so well, did she?
