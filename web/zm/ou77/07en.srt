1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,240
Leah, what are we gonna do?

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,660
I'll tell you what we're gonna do, Natalia.

3
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:07,740
We're gonna try two years ago.

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:12,150
Fight. Protect our pack.

5
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:13,150
We don't need my contact.

6
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:18,969
I can't believe he actually thought I would marry him.

7
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:22,030
He's delusional.

8
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:32,579
Always was. Always was.

9
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:33,579
Hey, Auntie.

10
00:00:33,579 --> 00:00:36,619
Long time no speak, dear niece.

11
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:38,619
Yeah, must be interesting.

12
00:00:38,619 --> 00:00:40,619
I've missed the salary voice.

13
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:46,100
He's not doing too good.

14
00:00:46,100 --> 00:01:01,289
Sorry. Are you back from your vacation?

15
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:05,109
Just bored and hangover.

16
00:01:05,109 --> 00:01:08,109
And then I saw you looking spaced out.

17
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:10,530
Something up?

18
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:14,750
Just, you know, family problems.

19
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,750
Family problems?

20
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:19,750
You haven't spoken to your family for like a couple of years.

21
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:22,010
Or have you?

22
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:25,140
Well, I heard from the mother yesterday.

23
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,140
Do you remember that guy I told you about from back home?

24
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:31,140
My sister was going to marry,

25
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,140
but she ran away off with his brother,

26
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:36,140
so he abandoned us in the middle of a battle.

27
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,140
Yeah, how could I forget?

28
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,000
Well, girl.

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Listen to this.

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
My father has arranged for me to marry him.

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Like, what the hell is that?

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Some kind of like 1800s or something.

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Wow.

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
And what are you going to do?

35
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
We're going home to deal with this outcast ourselves.

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Aren't we, Nat?

37
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,040
But what I do know is my father would never cold.

38
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:06,140
And ask me to return unless it was a matter of life or death.

39
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:09,969
So, I think it's time.

40
00:02:09,969 --> 00:02:12,969
Time for a work to go home.
