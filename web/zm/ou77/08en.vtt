00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:13.550
Where were you? This place nearly burned to the ground and you were nowhere to be seen.

2
00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:16.550
This isn't the way alliances are meant to work.

3
00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.309
We're not allies yet, right? Remember?

4
00:00:20.309 --> 00:00:26.510
What is this? It's pretty good.

5
00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.510
Is this a joke to you?

6
00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:30.609
My men are dying, Blake!

7
00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:32.609
You say that like it's something new.

8
00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:34.859
I understand it now.

9
00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:37.859
Why you're so desperate to marry my daughter.

10
00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:40.280
Oh, you do. And let me.

11
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.280
You know that the moon howlers are loyal.

12
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.570
Strong willed.

13
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.570
There may not be many of us left, but there's enough.

14
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:55.729
You know that we would never accept you as our alpha, and that's why you've never tried to seize our territory.

15
00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:58.049
Careful, men.

16
00:00:58.049 --> 00:01:00.049
You really think you could survive another heart attack?

17
00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:05.049
If my pack keeps getting raided, there'll be no moon howlers left, Blake.

18
00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:07.049
We have to get to the bottom of this.

19
00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.049
Who are these wolves and what the fuck do they want?

20
00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:13.269
I'm working on it.

21
00:01:13.269 --> 00:01:15.269
And what exactly do you know?

22
00:01:15.269 --> 00:01:17.530
We're allies, I'll tell you.

23
00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.530
You're unbelievable.

24
00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.590
No wonder Elizabeth rejected you.

25
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.590
Look, Ray.

26
00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.719
I want the old cast going, too.

27
00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:29.719
They're grabbing up all my territory that I need to invent the packs of California.

28
00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:31.719
So how long this as much as you do, Ray?

29
00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:32.719
More.

30
00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:37.340
Natalia.

31
00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.340
Hello, Dave.
