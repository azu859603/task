1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,760
Come here, Natalya.

2
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:06,349
Is that who I think it is?

3
00:00:06,349 --> 00:00:09,259
Can't we, Kat?

4
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:10,300
I don't know.

5
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:11,900
I don't definitely fuck her.

6
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,359
You wish, Wolfie.

7
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:16,719
What are you doing, Debbie?

8
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:19,600
I said, told me you're not allowed to leave a bit.

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,399
The outcasts don't give a damn about my medical problems.

10
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:27,820
You've grown into such a beautiful young woman.

11
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,579
Yes, I indeed changed.

12
00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:31,339
But that's what happens.

13
00:00:31,339 --> 00:00:36,979
Oh, fuck you, daddy.

14
00:00:36,979 --> 00:00:38,929
Let's go to bed.

15
00:00:39,009 --> 00:00:40,850
I'm not leaving you alone with him.

16
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:42,560
Oh.

17
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:47,250
As you said, he may be a big pebble.

18
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:50,560
But I don't know.

19
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,200
Right.

20
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:57,299
I'll be just down the hall if you need me.

21
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:04,560
Wake.

22
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,510
What are you doing here?

23
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:08,189
What am I doing here?

24
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:10,189
If it wasn't for me, your old man will be dead.

25
00:01:20,609 --> 00:01:21,730
Put some old spending here.

26
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:24,030
Try a little wolf.

27
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:25,469
She don't work on me.

28
00:01:25,469 --> 00:01:27,980
How could you explain not to work?
