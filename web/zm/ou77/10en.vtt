00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I saw what you did. I just don't understand your motives.

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
You never honored our alliance even two years ago, so what happened now?

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
First of all, it wasn't me who didn't honor the alliance.

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
It was your father. Secondly, do you have any idea how many men you've lost?

5
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.149
You don't do you. Last week eight, tonight five.

6
00:00:23.149 --> 00:00:28.629
Well, I'm at home now, and I will protect my family.

7
00:00:28.629 --> 00:00:33.630
Well, you really think you alone can protect your pack?

8
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:41.130
Yes, I will. What makes you think I can't? Is that because I'm a weak female?

9
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:47.579
No. It's not that you're a weak female. It's that you've been gone for a long time.

10
00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.770
Your people don't know you. They don't respect you.

11
00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.380
So they respect you? You are the reason.

12
00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.380
Oh, said we. You are the reason why my father is still fighting this battle.

13
00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.890
If he had a son, his heir, he would have retired.

14
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.890
Someone would have lived his best life.

15
00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:16.349
He really don't know, do you? Mess them up.
