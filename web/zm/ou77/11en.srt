1
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:05,129
Shit. All right, chain them up. I'm a boy

2
00:00:06,169 --> 00:00:09,119
What are you going? Where are you? I'll tell you I

3
00:00:14,859 --> 00:00:22,920
Don't fear old man Ray Ray White is not my helpful. I got this. Oh

4
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:36,020
What are you doing here? If you really want this place you must understand something

5
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:39,020
I am not the type who will stay on the sideline

6
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:45,380
Does kidding me angry give you a fucking high or something either we are to you or we're nothing

7
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:54,159
Do you guys need some privacy? I can leave did your daddy not teach you manners your hierarchy is bullshit

8
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:57,780
It won't last for much longer. It's our time now Blake

9
00:01:00,789 --> 00:01:04,569
I had a little brother who thought that way once you didn't end well for him

10
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:22,340
Now it's time for you to tell me everything. I'll take us anywhere. Let me try. I can find out here's plans

11
00:01:22,739 --> 00:01:25,980
I'm not leaving you alone with him. Please for once

12
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:33,230
Trust me. I'll be outside waiting

13
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:44,019
Remember idiot no matter how scary he is or even if this bitch tries to seduce you

14
00:01:44,299 --> 00:01:52,370
Don't tell them anything about our plans to attack the darkness don't back. Oh, I can assure you

15
00:01:52,989 --> 00:01:54,450
free me

16
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:56,450
My bite is much worse

17
00:01:57,109 --> 00:01:59,390
than a snare you can hear my wolf

18
00:01:59,989 --> 00:02:01,989
I'm not your typical princess

19
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:08,139
Now tell me everything you know about this attack on darkness don't back

20
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,379
Shit

21
00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:17,330
Why did you attack the moon pack was a deep way?

22
00:02:18,449 --> 00:02:25,610
Isn't it obvious so we can lure Blake away from the dark stone pack take his territory and displace him as alpha

23
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:30,610
Do you think it will be that easy a bunch of words like you to take now play content?

24
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:32,729
No

25
00:02:32,729 --> 00:02:35,930
But my alphanals play he knows his tricks

26
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:41,849
Tactics his weaknesses he knows everything about him. So cool. So you

27
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:45,840
You will find out real soon

28
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:49,099
Italian are you okay in there?

29
00:02:49,099 --> 00:03:06,289
That's what I do really make a taste pop. What do you do? Fuck him? Of course not

30
00:03:06,849 --> 00:03:09,259
I don't know what they've been. How?

31
00:03:10,129 --> 00:03:15,050
Blake just trust me. Okay. You're asking me for a whole lot of trust without giving me any okay

32
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:19,620
You know the attack on howlers was a deep way decoy

33
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:26,180
Yes, and they're planning to attack the dark moon stone back tonight at midnight tell that's not a funny joke

34
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:29,139
And I'm not joking. I heard him and his wolf

35
00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:35,569
You heard his inner wolf. Listen trust me. Don't trust me. I don't care

36
00:03:35,689 --> 00:03:37,689
The only thing I want to know is

37
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:48,379
Tell that's not a funny joke and I'm not joking. I heard him and his wolf. You heard his inner wolf

38
00:03:48,620 --> 00:04:01,210
Listen trust me. Don't trust me. I don't care. The only thing I want to know is what are we gonna do as a mole?

39
00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:09,360
Head back to the pack house. We got trouble. What are you going to defend my pack?

40
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,360
I'm going with it. No, you're not

41
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:18,759
Yes, I am. I am the only person who knows what their canvas and if you want to be there before they will attack the moon dark moon

42
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:31,310
Stone pack you need me coming out to play Wolfie. You know me

43
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:38,529
What is she doing here? What is she doing? But why what the boss has boss

44
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:43,519
Their question in you they think if I am my father

45
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:52,930
You're probably wondering why I asked people to come out tonight

46
00:04:54,110 --> 00:05:00,029
We're fighting old red white battles again, huh? Yeah, it worked out real well last time, didn't it?

47
00:05:01,629 --> 00:05:06,870
What the fucking moon hollers? Yeah, we're here because the outcast came on our land. Yeah

48
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:38,670
Yeah, fuck what are people? Yeah, I told you we were ready. Oh, that was nice. Good care of you

49
00:05:39,029 --> 00:06:22,019
What are you doing here? What is this place? I leave with a dark moon stone pack if you're you're talking, right?

50
00:06:22,579 --> 00:06:27,939
My best friend is a werewolf and she didn't tell me why oh, no, I'm not a werewolf

51
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:36,100
I'm a witch and what you're scaring me right now. What is a witch has to do with my roots? Well

52
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:42,819
Blake saved me one day from the mountain tales one day to cover the territory

53
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:49,180
I can say that he gave me a family. So you were spied the whole time

54
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:54,480
Unfucking believable. So what you're gonna do with me? Oh

55
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,949
My job is done here

56
00:06:58,949 --> 00:07:01,110
Just like ask me to

57
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:04,069
Spare you to knock you out

58
00:07:04,709 --> 00:07:06,709
so I did that and

59
00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:10,019
Now you're free you can go. Oh, so

60
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Is there anything that I need to know?

61
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I want you guys both of you

62
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:23,639
Why would you know anything about us? You know exactly right? You shouldn't have come here

63
00:07:27,509 --> 00:07:30,399
Where you going? I'm gonna find Blake

64
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:41,379
Seven Minitalia allow me to fight and defend out. Do you think Blake loves her? What are you talking about?

65
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:51,170
Witch that's not important. Oh, she loves him. I can tell girl. You need to stop. Blake Hunter is the reason your brother is dead

66
00:07:51,649 --> 00:07:54,370
He's the reason you were sent away. Maybe you're right, like

67
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:58,050
Blake

68
00:07:59,569 --> 00:08:01,569
I saw what you're there come forth

69
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:19,160
Until next time brother. What are you doing here? Well, you're welcome. I didn't just save your life on anything

70
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:30,389
Are you purposely defying me?

71
00:08:52,370 --> 00:09:01,269
Yeah, it is. Now is the perfect time to tell him that he needs to know that his brother is the one using the outcasts

72
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:06,559
You know, Blake, I have a friend who I thought was praying. Why'd you do in that?

73
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,289
Tell me what?

74
00:09:08,289 --> 00:09:10,080
Reveal yourself

75
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:16,240
That kind of sarcasm because it is like I don't get it. You really don't know do you? No what?

76
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:24,950
Prophecy of the white wolf. I didn't believe it back then either. I thought it was a myth. Now. I know it looked like a

77
00:09:27,029 --> 00:09:30,070
So are you gonna tell me or are you just gonna sit here monologuing?

78
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:33,960
20 years ago

79
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:38,690
An alpha fell in love with a moon god. I had a kid. The kid grew up

80
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,509
Came the white wolf. Man alpha

81
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:50,389
Who married the white wolf who chose her as his luna came the king of both kinds. I know it sounds crazy

82
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:54,710
Like stop it. It's true. You're lying. No, I'm not. Why would I lie to you?

83
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,940
Because my mother bled out and died

84
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,500
Well, give her a birth to me.

85
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,700
Apparently not

86
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:05,460
So you mean my father lied to me my entire life

87
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,879
Well

88
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:09,879
You are the white wolf

89
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,269
Felt your power

90
00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:14,769
Trust me

91
00:10:14,769 --> 00:10:16,529
It wouldn't be the first time your dead lied to you is it?

92
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:22,200
What is that supposed to mean?

93
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,200
It means back then

94
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,799
I didn't withdraw my forces because your sister rejected

95
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:31,559
How it drew them because your father refused to let me marry you

96
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:33,720
Now I know why

97
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,240
That's not true

98
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,190
It is true

99
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:39,539
Think about it. Tell

100
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:42,659
If we could have been married back then we could unite the pecs

101
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,059
And study sent you away

102
00:10:45,059 --> 00:10:47,539
Well, I was here. I was the one fighting for you

103
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:50,769
Where are you going?

104
00:10:50,769 --> 00:10:52,289
To confront my father

105
00:10:52,289 --> 00:11:24,740
Are you sure your father's not?

106
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:27,220
I have to find out more before I was still Blake

107
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:35,750
Think you're doing

108
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,830
Did my brother sent you to finish the job?

109
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:40,149
I saw you the outcast camp. You tried to give Blake

110
00:11:40,789 --> 00:11:42,230
Do you know who Blake really is?

111
00:11:42,789 --> 00:11:44,870
If you did, you would be on my side

112
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:46,500
What do you even mean?

113
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:50,120
Do you know how many girls Blake has in a single week

114
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,080
Or a single night?

115
00:11:52,529 --> 00:11:53,330
You're bluffing

116
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:55,730
I could see it in your eyes

117
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:57,330
You love him

118
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:59,970
Now I know you're bluffing

119
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:01,090
Well, too bad

120
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:03,409
It would have been a great ally

121
00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:06,149
The great white wolf

122
00:12:08,149 --> 00:12:15,190
Time to take out the hierarchy what's up

123
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:16,389
I'm ace now

124
00:12:16,389 --> 00:12:25,509
I dropped him in once I got all the ties from back

125
00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:25,990
Oh

126
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,039
Where's my sister?

127
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,559
That's a story for another day

128
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,200
You need to tell me

129
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,399
I will when I don't work

130
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,399
Where have you been?

131
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:52,919
Hi, I just had to clear my mind

132
00:12:53,509 --> 00:12:54,710
Did you find the runaway outcast?

133
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:56,389
Not away

134
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,799
You know, I've been thinking

135
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:07,490
Yes

136
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:09,649
I will marry you but under one condition

137
00:13:09,649 --> 00:13:10,370
And what's that?

138
00:13:11,009 --> 00:13:12,610
If I'm gonna be a luna

139
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:16,450
I want to participate in all major discussions about the dark moustache

140
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,440
Why is it funny?

141
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,559
I used to work in the best little fear in my new york before I came here

142
00:13:23,509 --> 00:13:25,190
It's just never been done before

143
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:27,720
And it will be it

144
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:31,409
Okay

145
00:13:31,409 --> 00:13:33,269
You're the white wolf

146
00:13:33,269 --> 00:13:34,389
You wish

147
00:13:34,389 --> 00:13:35,590
Is my command

148
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:38,870
You need to tell him that you converse with the brother he hates before you marry me

149
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:41,429
You need to confront him about animal

150
00:13:41,429 --> 00:13:43,509
Otherwise, you emerge with humans

151
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:52,799
Are you leaving my mother?

152
00:13:53,669 --> 00:13:57,009
Because I could actually use the mother on the advice right now

153
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,759
What about some following advice?

154
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:02,000
I have nothing to tell you

155
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:10,710
I didn't know who she was

156
00:14:11,509 --> 00:14:12,789
How could you not know?

157
00:14:12,789 --> 00:14:14,149
She seemed normal

158
00:14:14,149 --> 00:14:16,070
Introduced herself as Aria

159
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:17,909
A pure blood exhale by her pack

160
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:20,159
She loved

161
00:14:21,669 --> 00:14:23,990
She really loved ACDC

162
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,179
Bon Jovi

163
00:14:26,179 --> 00:14:27,059
All the classics

164
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:28,100
Really?

165
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:30,610
Seriously

166
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:32,929
And she was beautiful

167
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:38,149
My god, she was the most stunning woman I'd ever laid eyes upon

168
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:40,070
How did you meet her?

169
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:42,610
It's a long story

170
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:43,809
And one for another time

171
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:47,080
What matters right now is you

172
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:48,679
Blake

173
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,679
And securing our lives

174
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:54,149
By the way

175
00:14:54,149 --> 00:14:56,149
Why didn't you tell Blake

176
00:14:56,149 --> 00:14:58,389
That you ask Dylan to take away this one?

177
00:14:58,389 --> 00:14:59,990
Where's my sister anyway?

178
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:00,950
I'm telling her

179
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:04,470
You don't like hates Dylan and Dylan

180
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:05,429
I'm hates you

181
00:15:05,429 --> 00:15:06,950
How do you know about Dylan?

182
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:08,870
Have you lost connections for a little bit of children?

183
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:10,230
What do you know about Dylan?

184
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:10,789
It's all you

185
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:12,549
You ready for you?

186
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,000
Well, look at you

187
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:22,450
What's this?

188
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:24,529
It's an offering

189
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,289
Don't smell it

190
00:15:26,289 --> 00:15:32,000
I told you not to smell it

191
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,679
It smells like death

192
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:35,360
Yeah, and it tastes even worse

193
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:41,220
You're nervous

194
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,070
Focus on me

195
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:47,379
I don't think you're the best

196
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:48,419
It's all you

197
00:15:48,419 --> 00:15:49,539
It's my grandma

198
00:15:49,539 --> 00:15:50,500
Alison

199
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,450
It's my master major

200
00:15:52,450 --> 00:16:21,750
My child

201
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:22,309
My life

202
00:16:22,309 --> 00:16:42,320
You're dreaming of this?

203
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,720
Imagine us again

204
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,919
You'll go first

205
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:50,799
Remember you and I'll femme fatala me

206
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:52,320
and try to poison me with waltz man

207
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,600
I didn't try to poison you

208
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,799
Yes, you did

209
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,259
Our hunter life

210
00:17:00,259 --> 00:17:01,620
was from Celine

211
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,980
This means we have some

212
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,420
certain in-one abilities

213
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,869
We have to

214
00:17:06,869 --> 00:17:09,960
It's time

215
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,259
Alpha Blake Hunter

216
00:17:12,259 --> 00:17:14,500
Will mark Natalia White

217
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,099
As his chosen mate

218
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,819
They may not be fated

219
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:20,099
But we ask

220
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:23,619
You are not the moon

221
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:28,660
You know it'll be easy if you relax

222
00:18:01,809 --> 00:18:02,369
Out

223
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:08,529
I don't want to

224
00:18:08,529 --> 00:18:14,500
What you do, don't you?

225
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,539
Who is it?

226
00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:17,079
It's me

227
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:18,440
Speaking of the devil

228
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:24,609
Damn

229
00:18:24,609 --> 00:18:25,730
You need to talk

230
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,730
What do you need to talk about?

231
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:28,849
I want to go home

232
00:18:28,849 --> 00:18:32,549
I want you to come with me

233
00:18:32,549 --> 00:18:37,250
No sarcastic comment enough

234
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:52,710
Blake stop

235
00:18:52,710 --> 00:19:05,220
Let's tell you something

236
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,470
The wolf

237
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:07,990
They'll attach you to the Alka's camp

238
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,710
Yeah, we think it was the alpha

239
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:12,470
Yes, but the alpha, the Alka's

240
00:19:13,029 --> 00:19:15,269
You know him

241
00:19:15,269 --> 00:19:15,910
How do you know?

242
00:19:18,289 --> 00:19:19,410
My wolf there

243
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:20,210
She will hurt him

244
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:22,720
Blake will steal him your brother

245
00:19:24,579 --> 00:19:25,460
Couldn't be

246
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,500
How would him know him?

247
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,059
It's him

248
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:30,210
Why didn't you just tell me?

249
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,490
I didn't know how to tell you

250
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,259
You should have told me when you found out

251
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:36,609
Tell

252
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:37,569
He betrayed me

253
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:39,329
He ran away

254
00:19:39,329 --> 00:19:40,849
With my fate and mate

255
00:19:40,849 --> 00:19:41,730
He tried to kill me

256
00:19:42,529 --> 00:19:43,720
Like

257
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,799
Is there something else you want to tell me?

258
00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:47,799
I don't know, I'm having murderous thoughts right now

259
00:19:47,799 --> 00:19:51,119
How are you going?

260
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:52,720
I got no fucking idea

261
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,759
I'll tell you when I get there

262
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:00,259
Blake wait

263
00:20:00,259 --> 00:20:01,380
You really want to come?

264
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,579
Of course where's your brother?

265
00:20:03,779 --> 00:20:04,500
Fucking

266
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,220
Get him

267
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:12,950
We need to track him down

268
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:14,549
The brother who costs you your mother

269
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:18,079
You need to kill him before he kills you

270
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,559
Why does he have a good reason?

271
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:24,579
Goddamn your wolf telepathy

272
00:20:24,579 --> 00:20:25,460
Spit it out

273
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,740
It makes sense that Dylan would do this

274
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,480
He always hated the hierarchy

275
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:31,160
Who better than be the leader

276
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,920
Or punch a rogue werewolves

277
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,440
Than a fucking hybrid

278
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,240
Blake watch out

279
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,039
Shit

280
00:20:39,829 --> 00:20:41,430
It makes sense that Dylan would do this

281
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:43,029
He always hated the hierarchy

282
00:20:43,029 --> 00:20:44,710
Who better than be the leader

283
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,549
Or punch a rogue werewolves

284
00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:47,430
Please watch out

285
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:48,230
Shit

286
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:58,480
Don't look just him

287
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,119
Blake

288
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:40,849
It's easy

289
00:21:40,849 --> 00:22:16,630
Oh he will see my wolf

290
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:17,750
Follow me, Ned

291
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:18,630
I can help

292
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:20,529
Please see it, help me

293
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:23,829
Close your eyes, Ned

294
00:22:23,829 --> 00:22:24,789
You can bring him back

295
00:22:25,859 --> 00:22:27,619
You've had the power within you

296
00:22:27,619 --> 00:22:29,779
You, we, are the white wolf

297
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:59,859
What happened was driving

298
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,119
There was someone in the road

299
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:03,970
It was sort of, oh shit

300
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:04,930
Are you okay?

301
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:06,849
I'm like, how the hell am I so alive?

302
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:09,329
You help me a little

303
00:23:09,329 --> 00:23:11,059
It's gonna take more

304
00:23:11,059 --> 00:23:13,059
They're just the car accident to kill him

305
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:16,769
Blake

306
00:23:16,769 --> 00:23:17,569
Nice enough

307
00:23:17,569 --> 00:23:19,640
Your heart stopped, I built it

308
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:39,559
Don't try to get me

309
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:41,519
Kill this motherfucker

310
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:42,319
Sit or be done

311
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:44,079
I want to pick his flesh from my teeth

312
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:44,960
You feel me?

313
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:45,599
To give him

314
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:49,200
Also make us a list of allies

315
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,160
It's time to body up

316
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:50,960
Gotcha

317
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:55,910
I ain't never want to come closer to those in you again

318
00:23:57,329 --> 00:23:58,210
We're all new now

319
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:10,230
Blake

320
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:12,289
I've heard about my system

321
00:24:12,289 --> 00:24:16,279
No, not since I lost such a villain

322
00:24:16,279 --> 00:24:39,839
How do you know about Blake?

323
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:47,539
Tell me

324
00:24:47,539 --> 00:24:56,500
How do you know about my question?

325
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:13,890
What are you even doing here?

326
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:16,369
I can feel the darkness inside of a few

327
00:25:16,369 --> 00:25:20,019
It's deep, it's like you've been touched by death

328
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:21,140
Are you okay?

329
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,500
Emma, you're crazy

330
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:23,859
What do you want?

331
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:26,579
On what do I want?

332
00:25:26,579 --> 00:25:27,539
It's Friday

333
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:30,529
And we have fun on Friday

334
00:25:31,009 --> 00:25:33,190
Not anymore, we don't

335
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:35,680
Not anymore, we don't

336
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,559
It's over

337
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:37,200
Why?

338
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,960
Oh, is it because of her?

339
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:45,279
Are you pushing me away?

340
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:47,430
For her?

341
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:50,390
No, no, no, no

342
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:51,910
I refuse to be the fool

343
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:53,509
We have to get to your mark, Anthony

344
00:25:53,509 --> 00:25:53,990
Emma

345
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:55,109
Okay, no

346
00:25:55,109 --> 00:25:57,750
Blake, you are completely forgetting yourself

347
00:25:57,750 --> 00:26:00,900
By your side through all these years

348
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,980
It was me, not anyone else

349
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:19,940
Every battle

350
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,000
Stop

351
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,039
Get it through your head

352
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:24,519
I was using you

353
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:25,960
And I'm sorry for that, okay?

354
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:27,720
But not Talia's my wife

355
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,039
You think, babe?

356
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:38,869
Skill from 1 to 100, how pissed you think she is

357
00:26:39,589 --> 00:26:41,029
I'd say she took it pretty well

358
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:44,960
Stupid question, stupid answer

359
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,039
So basically, you were using this point a little bit

360
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:51,880
to spawn

361
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:56,599
While having something on the side

362
00:26:56,599 --> 00:27:00,900
Really, we take the floor

363
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:03,839
You can't get me out of own bed?

364
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,680
You deserve it

365
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,400
That girl

366
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,680
I have shoots

367
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,039
Shit things

368
00:27:10,039 --> 00:27:12,119
This really means something to you, doesn't it?

369
00:27:12,119 --> 00:27:27,240
No, not really

370
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:27,960
Fuck

371
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:54,960
Never say sorry

372
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,400
The floor sucked anyways

373
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:00,690
It's just a nightmare

374
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:02,849
I have it every now and then

375
00:28:02,849 --> 00:28:04,529
I've had it out for California

376
00:28:04,529 --> 00:28:06,049
It doesn't have any one nightmares

377
00:28:06,049 --> 00:28:07,640
No, I do

378
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,759
All the time

379
00:28:08,759 --> 00:28:09,839
You too?

380
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:12,200
Yeah, I'm not in vulnerable pain

381
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,799
I mean, I wish I was shit

382
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:15,269
What are they about?

383
00:28:15,269 --> 00:28:25,269
If I tell you, you gonna tell me?

384
00:28:25,269 --> 00:28:25,910
My mom

385
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:33,200
You never told me

386
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,460
I remember it like it was yesterday

387
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,380
My dad was actually with your dad

388
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:40,369
They were planning their next conquest

389
00:28:40,369 --> 00:28:42,130
So my mom took Dilla and I to the park

390
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:45,009
We were planning to stick the wing game

391
00:28:45,009 --> 00:28:46,609
and see who could throw it to farthest

392
00:28:46,609 --> 00:28:47,730
And I was winning every time

393
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:49,650
Of course

394
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:56,119
But then eventually, we ran into some wolf hunters

395
00:28:56,119 --> 00:28:57,000
A human trap

396
00:28:58,079 --> 00:29:02,279
But I used to live with humans

397
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:05,880
And I can't even imagine them doing something like this

398
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:09,079
Well, they were definitely wolf hunters

399
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:11,759
Anyways

400
00:29:13,059 --> 00:29:14,819
My mom told me and Dilla and she said run

401
00:29:15,539 --> 00:29:17,140
Run like your life depends on it

402
00:29:18,529 --> 00:29:19,089
And I did

403
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:22,289
My little brother, he's not as fast

404
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:25,109
They eventually caught up with him

405
00:29:26,069 --> 00:29:27,750
But Dilla, he's fine now

406
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:30,559
Yeah

407
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,240
Because my mom went back and saved them

408
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:34,240
In the process, she got killed

409
00:29:39,559 --> 00:29:41,480
I don't want to hate Dilla and I don't

410
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,279
My mom doesn't

411
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,039
She never did

412
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:47,990
He makes it so damn

413
00:29:48,549 --> 00:30:17,670
He'll get bored of you, you know

414
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,519
Excuse me

415
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:20,559
Blake

416
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:23,920
Yeah, he does that from time to time

417
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:26,000
He will find a new toy

418
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:31,119
He will play you for a week and then come back to me

419
00:30:32,309 --> 00:30:34,309
Because he always comes back to me

420
00:30:34,869 --> 00:30:38,390
You are the most two-faced person I have ever seen

421
00:30:38,789 --> 00:30:41,349
The fact that I thought of you as a friend as a good friend

422
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:46,849
You know, besides sticking shit, all you do is fake

423
00:30:51,809 --> 00:30:53,890
I know you're hiding something from him

424
00:30:54,849 --> 00:30:58,130
And I will find out what you're hiding sooner or later

425
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:00,579
Yeah, you do that

426
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:20,660
And we got the moon hollers and leaguers now, but

427
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:21,779
Help array

428
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:23,460
He's old, he's weak

429
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:25,460
He has 10 able-bodied men

430
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:30,359
I've invited every alpha I can think of to the wedding, so

431
00:31:31,299 --> 00:31:32,099
You should be good

432
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:36,180
So you know, pecs dynamics

433
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:39,619
But you're also making plans about my wedding

434
00:31:39,619 --> 00:31:40,339
Without me

435
00:31:41,089 --> 00:31:41,650
The bride?

436
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:45,430
Hell, not everything's always about you

437
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:47,109
It's bigger than that

438
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,400
Okay Blake, there is something else I have to do with us

439
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:56,240
Dylan, he's no name is Ace, he's one

440
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:00,740
Dylan and Ace are the same person

441
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,180
And you guys both fucking knew about this

442
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:11,640
Wait, Ace and Dylan are the same person?

443
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,940
That means that

444
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:16,099
The hybrids and the outcasts are both run by your brother

445
00:32:16,849 --> 00:32:18,289
How the fuck do you know that?

446
00:32:18,289 --> 00:32:19,329
I met him in the castle

447
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:22,930
But he and his men managed to escape before he got there

448
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:25,250
Tell you're holding stuff from me again

449
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:27,250
How am I supposed to ever trust you?

450
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:31,970
Anyways, what do you mean you met my brother in the cabin?

451
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:34,450
Yes, and he cornered me with his wounds

452
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:37,170
And I couldn't find a straight answer about Elizabeth

453
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:39,329
And that's it, that's all I know, okay?

454
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:43,269
And I didn't tell you first because he told me that you were a womanizer

455
00:32:43,269 --> 00:32:45,109
So I wanted to find out for myself

456
00:32:45,109 --> 00:32:47,269
And, and it's true, focus yourself

457
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:51,940
Why do you think I was so conservative when I saw you and me?

458
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,299
And you still agreed to marry me?

459
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:56,160
Because part of me is a warrior

460
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:58,319
And I need to marry you

461
00:32:58,319 --> 00:33:00,960
To make sure that I will get what I want

462
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:01,759
Besides, Ace

463
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:05,119
Is also a great wolf

464
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:07,720
The one who killed my brother, Zach

465
00:33:08,279 --> 00:33:10,440
So, off of him, waiting

466
00:33:12,849 --> 00:33:15,880
We'll take a fight to Ace back

467
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,869
Hell, Zach died protecting you

468
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,200
The last thing we need is another white wolf order

469
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,660
The best thing we can do is take Ace out

470
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,880
Before the shit get down

471
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,759
Then let's take him out

472
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:30,769
How exactly are we supposed to do that?

473
00:33:32,309 --> 00:33:35,109
You always thought that the white wolf would make danger

474
00:33:36,789 --> 00:33:37,349
Yeah

475
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:38,309
What about your pack?

476
00:33:38,309 --> 00:33:39,829
What about other elves?

477
00:33:39,829 --> 00:33:40,710
Probably

478
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:41,829
So let's do it

479
00:33:41,829 --> 00:33:43,109
Present me

480
00:33:43,109 --> 00:33:44,789
That's the white wolf to your pack

481
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,240
Boss, this could actually work

482
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,200
If the other elves see that you got the white wolf as your lunar

483
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,640
They'd have no choice but the one day see you as king

484
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,839
You see, my small grizz
