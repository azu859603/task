1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,539
You sure she's okay?

2
00:00:13,539 --> 00:00:14,539
She's fine.

3
00:00:14,539 --> 00:00:16,980
I don't know, Grandma.

4
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,260
One moment she was okay and the next she passed out.

5
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,420
Physically, she's fine.

6
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,339
We'll know more when she wakes up.

7
00:00:23,339 --> 00:00:25,739
Until then, why don't you have a rest?

8
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:31,800
I won't be able to sleep until she's up yelling at me and pissing me off.

9
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,119
Grandma, why are you looking at me like that?

10
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:38,399
The last time you looked at me like that, I was made alpha.

11
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:39,399
You love her, don't you?

12
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:49,890
To admit it, you know.

13
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:54,219
You two may not be fainted, but she is your soulmate.

14
00:00:54,219 --> 00:00:56,020
Are they not the same?

15
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:57,380
No.

16
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:04,379
Your grandfather was not the person that the moon goddess chose from me, but he was my soulmate.

17
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:08,819
And if I can see that Natalia is yours, soak in the pack too.

18
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:18,879
I bet she doesn't like it.

19
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:20,359
Grandma, stay with Natalia.

20
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:21,359
Where are you going?

21
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:23,680
Not a heart to heart with a witch, that's for sure.
