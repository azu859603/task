00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.559
AHA! Open the door! I can smell you, Emma! Open the door!

2
00:00:05.559 --> 00:00:11.050
What the fuck did you do?

3
00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.050
Calm down, Wolfie boy! What happened?

4
00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:17.050
What did you do to Natalia?

5
00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.050
Okay, I got me.

6
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.839
Don't play games with me, Emma.

7
00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:24.339
Okay, okay. She's fine. Don't worry about her.

8
00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:30.839
He was just a harmless spell. She wake up tomorrow morning. All safe and sound.

9
00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:36.740
But, man, that headache is gonna hurt like something.

10
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:43.789
Shut up! Don't give me a little lunch. It's only over here at the time that it's over.

11
00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:48.789
Well, if you wanted to get that close, be all you had to do was ask.

12
00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:52.240
All right, fine, fine, boy. Let's have it your way.

13
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:57.009
I knew that she was hiding something from you.

14
00:00:57.009 --> 00:01:03.130
And I wanted to find out what was she happening for you.

15
00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:04.129
How do you know that?

16
00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.129
Well, you know I can sense those fakes, Bea.

17
00:01:07.129 --> 00:01:08.129
What is she hiding?

18
00:01:08.129 --> 00:01:09.510
Your brother.

19
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.510
What about him?

20
00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.510
Your brother. She met with him.

21
00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:18.340
Oh, Emma. We're two steps ahead of you.

22
00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.340
Natalia has something you'll never have. She's honest with me.

23
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.659
I'm gonna give you two days, two fucking days to get out of here.

24
00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:27.659
What? What? No.

25
00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.049
Blake! Blake, come here!

26
00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.049
Blake!
