1
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:10,699
There she is.

2
00:00:10,699 --> 00:00:11,699
What happened?

3
00:00:11,699 --> 00:00:13,699
What do you remember?

4
00:00:13,699 --> 00:00:16,699
I remember Blake presented me to the pack.

5
00:00:16,699 --> 00:00:18,699
They lay offering inside my feet.

6
00:00:18,699 --> 00:00:21,699
And then I remember this noise.

7
00:00:21,699 --> 00:00:23,699
This horrible noise.

8
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:25,699
Like a ringing in your ears?

9
00:00:25,699 --> 00:00:26,699
Yes.

10
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:27,699
Exactly.

11
00:00:27,699 --> 00:00:29,699
I thought my head would explode.

12
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:32,950
And then suddenly everything went black.

13
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:45,619
Therefore my child, I fear that there are people inside these walls.

14
00:00:45,619 --> 00:00:48,659
What would mean to do you harm my people outside?

15
00:00:48,659 --> 00:00:50,659
What would mean to manipulate you?

16
00:00:50,659 --> 00:00:53,820
Your power, your influence.

17
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:54,820
Ooh.

18
00:00:54,820 --> 00:01:01,840
I don't have all the answers.

19
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,840
I can only see what the moon goddess allows.

20
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,950
Be careful.

21
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,950
I'll find it. It was just a library.

22
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:12,420
He's here.
