1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:03,359
Massimo, you're a pure blood, right?

2
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:04,620
Yeah.

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:05,620
Yeah.

4
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:10,960
Back in the day, our forefathers ran these forests.

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:11,960
All pure bloods.

6
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:16,859
But then some of those dudes couldn't get their dick in their pants.

7
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:20,269
Got with some humans, painting our bloodlines.

8
00:00:20,269 --> 00:00:21,269
That's the history.

9
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:23,269
Can't rewrite it.

10
00:00:23,269 --> 00:00:26,070
But you can change the future.

11
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,539
Uh, enlighten me.

12
00:00:28,539 --> 00:00:32,090
For millennia, our people have been fighting each other.

13
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:33,090
Wolf against wolf.

14
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:34,090
Over what?

15
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:35,090
Mates.

16
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:36,090
Territory.

17
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:38,179
Wasting our day on time.

18
00:00:38,179 --> 00:00:40,250
Failing to see the true threat.

19
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:41,409
Humans.

20
00:00:41,409 --> 00:00:47,259
Humans wouldn't know a werewolf if it bit him on the ass.

21
00:00:47,259 --> 00:00:50,259
We're just mythological creatures to them.

22
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:51,259
That's it.

23
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:52,259
No.

24
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:54,490
All it takes for one human.

25
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:56,579
And he's gonna tell another.

26
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:57,579
And then he's gonna tell another.

27
00:00:57,579 --> 00:00:58,579
And he's gonna tell another.

28
00:00:58,579 --> 00:01:00,579
Yeah, and the full moon comes out.

29
00:01:00,579 --> 00:01:04,579
And a werewolf bites a human and kills a couple of them.

30
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:07,319
Chaos.

31
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:09,319
Exposing our people.

32
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,319
Massimo.

33
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:11,319
And then what happens?

34
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:14,659
To wolf hunters.

35
00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:17,069
That's the cycle.

36
00:01:17,069 --> 00:01:19,140
It's inevitable.

37
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,140
Unchangeable.

38
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:23,730
Nothing's.

39
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:24,730
Unchangeable.

40
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:28,260
I see your vision, man.

41
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:29,260
I mean, I'm with you.

42
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:31,260
One United wolf pack.

43
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,260
I get it.

44
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:35,540
What about the hybrids?

45
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,859
The turn?

46
00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:39,959
We're just gonna kill them?

47
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:41,959
What you gonna do with them?

48
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:42,959
That's what you know of me.

49
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:43,959
I'm not a dictator.

50
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:46,730
They can mate with the purebloods.

51
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:47,730
Pure find their bloodlines.

52
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:52,260
Hybrids like Ace.

53
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,260
The outcasts.

54
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:56,260
They stand for everything that we've been working for.

55
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:57,260
Everything!

56
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:00,120
We put our blood in sweat into.

57
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,120
They stand for chaos and destruction, Massimo.

58
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,120
So I ask you, what are we gonna fight for?

59
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,849
A world plagued by war.

60
00:02:09,849 --> 00:02:10,849
Death.

61
00:02:10,849 --> 00:02:11,849
Destruction.

62
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:15,629
Wolf.

63
00:02:15,629 --> 00:02:16,629
And wolf.

64
00:02:16,629 --> 00:02:17,629
Stand together.
