1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,500
Natalia, you're better.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,299
I'm messy.

3
00:00:05,299 --> 00:00:07,299
That's enough.

4
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:08,419
You got it.

5
00:00:08,419 --> 00:00:12,949
Hell, I'm really glad you're better.

6
00:00:12,949 --> 00:00:14,369
Can I ask you something?

7
00:00:14,369 --> 00:00:17,839
Of course, anything.

8
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:19,839
What happened that night of the accident?

9
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:22,420
Massimo told me my heart stopped.

10
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:24,899
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

11
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:26,899
I had to. You needed me.

12
00:00:26,899 --> 00:00:27,899
I don't need anyone.

13
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:31,370
You died and I brought you back.

14
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:32,369
How'd you do that?

15
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:35,369
I don't know. My emotions took over and it just happened.

16
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:36,369
Why didn't you tell me?

17
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:38,369
Because I didn't want you to react like this.

18
00:00:38,369 --> 00:00:40,369
How the fuck do you want me to react?

19
00:00:40,369 --> 00:00:42,369
Buy you a fucking present?

20
00:00:42,369 --> 00:00:46,350
I need a brother fresh airy.

21
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:55,130
Please.

22
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:56,130
Sit, Aries.

23
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:58,130
You're falling in love with her.

24
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:00,700
How is it possible?

25
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,700
Far in love with a woman who pisses you off so much.

26
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,700
That, I don't know.

27
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,569
I can't do it, Aries.

28
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:11,209
I can't let myself fall in love with her.

29
00:01:11,209 --> 00:01:13,209
I don't think you can stop it.

30
00:01:13,209 --> 00:01:16,739
I really have to.

31
00:01:16,739 --> 00:01:20,340
She kept a couple of truths.

32
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,659
She eventually fessed up.

33
00:01:22,659 --> 00:01:25,500
It's not that, Aries.

34
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,780
It's that I'm not her true mate.

35
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,780
One day her fate admit will come claim her.

36
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,680
Then she'll leave.

37
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:43,689
Everyone always leaves in the end.

38
00:01:43,689 --> 00:01:44,689
Good talk, buddy.
