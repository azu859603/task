1
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,700
Oh, hey, hey

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:13,699
Sorry, I should have told you no don't say sorry your power. It's amazing you

3
00:00:14,339 --> 00:00:16,260
You're amazing

4
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,570
You know, I've been thinking a lot about when I cleaned Elizabeth as my mate

5
00:00:20,129 --> 00:00:22,769
What about it? It's hard to me for a long time

6
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:28,940
Like no that I got to get this out your face

7
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:35,969
When I claimed her the tears in your eyes a little crinkle you get your forehead when you're upset

8
00:00:36,609 --> 00:00:42,909
Had it broke my heart so you mean you have a heart I do

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,640
That's not the point the point is

10
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:54,780
I've loved you. I've always loved you since we were children and you wore that bail on your head saying you want to marry me

11
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,909
What are you doing?

12
00:01:02,909 --> 00:01:13,650
Something I should have done a long time ago. It's all your weight. I love you. I've always loved you. Will you marry me?
