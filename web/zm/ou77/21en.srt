1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,490
Blake!

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:11,710
You're boring, beautiful.

3
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:13,839
Don't worry, I handled it.

4
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:16,940
You mean you had the pack made it without me?

5
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:17,940
Yeah.

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,570
Blake!

7
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:22,570
You're looking so peaceful, I don't want to wake you.

8
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:26,570
You promised me that I will always be involved in the pack meetings.

9
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:32,170
Besides, if I'm going to be a woman, you need to be involved.

10
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:35,579
You might be pregnant. I want to do the rest.

11
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:38,579
You can't have the pack thinking I can't have airs.

12
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:40,810
It's not 50s anymore, Blake.

13
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:42,810
I'm not some kind of housewife.

14
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:44,810
Sit by, idle, and pop up your kids.

15
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:46,810
It's not going to work with you.

16
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:53,799
Trust me, tonight I need you ready.

17
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:54,799
My dad's coming.

18
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:56,829
We need you to be able to meet him.

19
00:00:56,829 --> 00:00:58,829
So now, he wants to involve me.

20
00:00:58,829 --> 00:00:59,829
Do?

21
00:00:59,829 --> 00:01:00,829
I love it when you're mad at me.

22
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:02,829
Well, I don't know.

23
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:07,349
What do you want?

24
00:01:07,349 --> 00:01:11,590
I need to talk to you about what?

25
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:14,590
Now, why don't you just go get some breakfast?

26
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:16,590
I'm going to talk to Emma a little bit.

27
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:17,590
Now, what's going on?

28
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:21,579
Well, are you sure you want to talk?

29
00:01:21,579 --> 00:01:25,739
What? Emma, come inside. I want to know.

30
00:01:25,739 --> 00:01:29,409
Now, it's just...

31
00:01:29,409 --> 00:01:31,409
Well, I'm pregnant.
