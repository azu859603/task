1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
What?

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I'm pregnant!

3
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:09,650
And you're the father?

4
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:14,330
No!

5
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:16,550
Why would I lie about this?

6
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:18,550
You know how much capital a child needs?

7
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:20,870
Wait, what the fuck?

8
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:24,190
Oh, it's okay to tell you.

9
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:31,350
Well, we used to sit on his balcony and talk about starting a family.

10
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:34,350
It was our little dream, wasn't it?

11
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:35,350
Seriously.

12
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:36,350
She's lying.

13
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:38,670
She's pregnant.

14
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:40,990
You know what?

15
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:41,990
I felt bad.

16
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:42,990
So bad.

17
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:46,149
For keeping the truth from you.

18
00:00:46,149 --> 00:00:48,149
But the secret is that I kept.

19
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:50,149
I kept to protect you.

20
00:00:50,149 --> 00:00:52,149
And it's nothing to compare to this.

21
00:00:52,149 --> 00:00:55,149
This is not a fucking moral competition, Nat.

22
00:00:55,149 --> 00:00:57,149
Can't you see what she's trying to do?

23
00:00:57,149 --> 00:00:58,149
She's trying to break this.

24
00:00:58,149 --> 00:00:59,149
Us.

25
00:00:59,149 --> 00:01:00,149
Up.

26
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:01,149
Put your eyes in that.

27
00:01:01,149 --> 00:01:03,149
She's trying to drive the woods between us.

28
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:04,150
Okay.

29
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:06,150
Is it possible that she's pregnant with your child?

30
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:08,629
Who are you guys like?

31
00:01:08,629 --> 00:01:09,629
Yeah.

32
00:01:09,629 --> 00:01:15,500
She'd be weeks on by now.

33
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,500
Where are you going?

34
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,500
I need to process this.

35
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,500
Damn it.

36
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:24,420
You need to make right chance, Blake.

37
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,420
If you want to unite all of the pucks in California,

38
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:33,209
and then lead them, you need Earths.

39
00:01:33,209 --> 00:01:36,620
And I can't give you girl.

40
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:40,430
Just listen.

41
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:41,780
Am I?

42
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:42,780
You better hope this kid comes a turn.

43
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:46,459
Because if it doesn't, fuck it doesn't.
