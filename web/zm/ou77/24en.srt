1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
She has to go tell.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
She's pregnant with your child, Blake.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
It's fake. Like everything she does.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Can't you see, tell? It's manipulation.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Take a stand, Blake.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Stop letting this woman walk all over you.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,670
What's your tongue? Wolfie.

8
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:22,670
Alright, okay. If you want to send her out, just do it.

9
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:24,670
But I'm going with her.

10
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:27,670
No, you're not. We had an agreement.

11
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:29,670
Well, yes, but agreements can be broken, you know?

12
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:33,670
Not by a possible child. It was before you were here.

13
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:37,250
It still hurts the same, Blake.

14
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,250
No, I don't want to hurt you.

15
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:43,250
I know it. Fuck, Blake. When those words escape her mouth,

16
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,250
I was in so much pain. I thought I would die.

17
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:50,250
Do you think about you guys were together when she was pretending to be my friend in New York?

18
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,250
I can barely look as she wishes around.

19
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,250
What are you saying?

20
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:58,630
I'm saying that. As long as she's here, I'm not going to marry you.
