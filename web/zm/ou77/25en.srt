1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,469
Tell, all that shit happened before you were back.

2
00:00:04,469 --> 00:00:06,049
There's nothing to do with you.

3
00:00:06,049 --> 00:00:08,750
Look, this is what we're gonna do.

4
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:10,390
Emma's gone.

5
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:13,390
If there is a baby, we're gonna keep it.

6
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:15,990
And you're gonna be its mom, my wife.

7
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,010
You know, he was right, like,

8
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:20,850
your shake gives you an air.

9
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:23,170
She's the one you shouldn't hear me.

10
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:25,250
Tell, let her go, Blake.

11
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,109
Your pump is more important.

12
00:00:27,109 --> 00:00:52,859
What the fuck is this?

13
00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:54,859
Is that shadow book you're telling me about?

14
00:00:54,859 --> 00:00:56,359
Yes, it is.

15
00:00:56,359 --> 00:00:59,409
What the fuck, Emma?

16
00:00:59,409 --> 00:01:00,710
What are those?

17
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:02,570
Shut up.

18
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:03,369
Now I can cook.

19
00:01:03,369 --> 00:01:06,069
Fucking crazy, Emma.

20
00:01:06,069 --> 00:01:07,769
This is what killed your mom.

21
00:01:07,769 --> 00:01:09,069
How would you do this?

22
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,670
How would you risk your life?

23
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:12,670
Because you left me no choice.

24
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:14,700
You always have a choice.

25
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:15,700
It's his, isn't it?

26
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,700
That's him all.

27
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:17,700
It's his baby, right?

28
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,359
Damn it, Emma.

29
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:24,859
Nobody has to know the truth about the baby,

30
00:01:24,859 --> 00:01:26,859
but it is in yours.

31
00:01:26,859 --> 00:01:31,079
Because he's gonna be the most powerful king.

32
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:33,180
I know it.

33
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,180
Blake, I can...

34
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:37,299
He's gonna control the shadows.

35
00:01:37,299 --> 00:01:44,569
And he's gonna become the most fearful.

36
00:01:44,569 --> 00:01:47,140
Just like his father.

37
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,140
Do you think you're fooling, Emma?

38
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,140
Look at Massimo.

39
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,140
Look at me.

40
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,140
We look nothing alike.

41
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,140
The one's the good thing is my damn baby.

42
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,140
You're going nuts, Emma.

43
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,650
You gotta stop this shit.

44
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:01,650
No, I just realized I have spent so many years

45
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:03,650
just to try to win your approval.

46
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:09,580
And now I just realized that I was actually never gonna get it, was I?

47
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:14,310
And it's just because I'm not here.

48
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:17,240
What are you doing, Emma?

49
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:22,240
What do you think she's gonna do if I tell her what happened between us?

50
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,240
Do you think she's gonna marry you?

51
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,240
What's your tongue?

52
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:30,719
If I cannot have you, neither can she.
