00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.890
You love her?

2
00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:13.679
I was gonna tell you.

3
00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.059
Tell me what?

4
00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:18.059
We're looking out for a while.

5
00:00:18.059 --> 00:00:21.500
So you don't love her?

6
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.500
Well, that's my kid, man. I don't even know if it's mine.

7
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.500
Of course it's not your fucking kid.

8
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.500
She's a liar. I couldn't smell anything.

9
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.109
Could you? No.

10
00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:36.960
He's manipulating you, man.

11
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.039
Just feel bad for him, man.

12
00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:44.070
I really thought that was my kid for a while.

13
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.170
We were pretty... pretty what?

14
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.170
Active?

15
00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:48.170
Yeah.

16
00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.859
Goddamn it, Massimo.

17
00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:56.469
I'm not mad at you because you're a horn dog.

18
00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:57.469
I get that.

19
00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:01.020
I think it's time our whole pack steps are shit up.

20
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.909
You just have a good woman.

21
00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:07.170
What I'm doing is time to wake up, bro.

22
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.349
Hey.

23
00:01:09.349 --> 00:01:20.750
You're doing Massimo.

24
00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:29.920
Yes, boss.

25
00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.920
Shadow magic is as dangerous as you say it isn't.

26
00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.109
What are we even doing here?

27
00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:46.390
I'll deal with you later.

28
00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.030
If you ever return, tear out your heart.

29
00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:57.430
Yes, Alpha.

30
00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:08.069
Go, Massimo.
