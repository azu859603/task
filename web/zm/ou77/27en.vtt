00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:06.700
Tell wait. What do you want? What are you going? I'm going back to New York. No

2
00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:14.310
Can't you just give me one minute this Emma thing is too much Blake Hunter is more hassle than he's all right

3
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:16.309
But just one minute. I

4
00:00:18.379 --> 00:00:29.219
Knew you would like it down here. I mean it's beautiful from the balcony down here

5
00:00:29.969 --> 00:00:32.509
Something special right

6
00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:39.899
Shouldn't you be at home with Emma and your child? She's gone. What she's not praying that she lied to us

7
00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:46.549
What do you mean? Let's not talk about her that I'm sorry. I hurt you

8
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.859
You know, you're gonna have to do something more than just say sorry feels up to me

9
00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.820
How do you the rest of my life making it up to you? I feel like you're

10
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.939
Build up titanium walls or something protecting yourself

11
00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:04.290
Blake

12
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:13.849
My walls are there for a reason. I'm damaged. I'm scared little girl. It's been a decade alone. I'm damaged too

13
00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.939
Maybe that's why it works. So

14
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.719
Can we try again?

15
00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:28.519
What's that?

16
00:01:28.519 --> 00:01:30.519
Instead of right in humans

17
00:01:30.519 --> 00:01:38.370
Try to learn how to trust it to work with you drive a hard bargain. Is there a yes? I'll think about it
