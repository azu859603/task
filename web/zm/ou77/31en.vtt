00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:07.950
I'm good. I'm good. I've seen your morning woman. Go. Go.

2
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.330
But one more. Please.

3
00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.160
It's sensitive. Right? You wrote.

4
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.859
You think that is what real love looks like?

5
00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:28.699
Come on. What are you doing here?

6
00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:33.460
Oh, you really know how to write them all, don't you?

7
00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.460
I asked you a question. Just answer it.

8
00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.460
Let me ask you a question.

9
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.990
If you don't believe in love, do you believe in faith?

10
00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:48.840
Fuck no.

11
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.840
Well, is there anything you do believe in?

12
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.740
I'm asking the questions here, okay?

13
00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.740
Bye, you hotshot.

14
00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.570
I'll answer you.

15
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.659
You see, I actually am not here.

16
00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:12.109
I'm upstairs waiting for you.

17
00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:49.500
Meingling?

18
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.500
You dare to show your face here?

19
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.500
We were friends once.

20
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.500
You and I, back when the chrysot wolves roamed.

21
00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.049
Well, things don't last forever.

22
00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.049
Especially when you trust Blake Hunter.

23
00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:07.879
Blake did that?

24
00:02:07.879 --> 00:02:09.879
No, not directly.

25
00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:11.939
But it's responsible for it.

26
00:02:11.939 --> 00:02:15.990
You feel it, don't you?

27
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.990
Your heartbeat has slowed, your senses are tightened,

28
00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.990
and your nerves are tingling, and that smell.

29
00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:32.370
Oh, that smell of pine wood and coniferous destroying us together.

30
00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.500
What is this?

31
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.060
I think you know.

32
00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.099
Your dead!

33
00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:40.099
Bye!
