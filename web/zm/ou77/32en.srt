1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,980
You think you can fuck with a pure blood alpha?

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:09,480
You may be an alpha, but in my world, you have nothing more than a bitch!

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,800
Good thing I'll give a fuck about your world!

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,239
Blake!

5
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:17,370
Dylan?

6
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:18,370
Oh, yeah!

7
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,000
Shit, Dylan.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Dig into the alpha pack, and it helped.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,019
What?

10
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:29,300
Sorry, brother.

11
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,800
This way you can't forgive our mother.

12
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,060
Blake!

13
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:34,060
Don't leave me!

14
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:38,899
What's up Blakey?

15
00:00:38,899 --> 00:00:40,899
Seems like you've seen a ghost!

16
00:00:40,899 --> 00:00:42,899
Step away from her, Dylan!

17
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:49,240
You're protecting him!

18
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,240
Oh, we're mates now!

19
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:55,630
Funny how karma comes back to bite you in the ass!

20
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:57,630
Isn't it, brother?
