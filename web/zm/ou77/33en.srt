1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,899
What the fuck do you want?

2
00:00:01,899 --> 00:00:03,060
Isn't it obvious?

3
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,820
Your pack, your title, and your girl.

4
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:06,860
You're out of this.

5
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:09,960
She's your ally, is she not?

6
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,359
I was your ally once.

7
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:14,000
Brothers from the same father.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,039
And then one day, you left me for dead

9
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:20,489
and sees my pack.

10
00:00:20,489 --> 00:00:24,539
Just to put on that crown on your head.

11
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:27,620
If you stay in his way, he will betray you too.

12
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:29,699
He isn't capable for any love.

13
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:30,940
Is this true?

14
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:32,539
I told you my hands were single blood.

15
00:00:32,539 --> 00:00:34,060
Oh, they're not stained.

16
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,020
You're drowning in it.

17
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:39,689
And you will too, if you stay.

18
00:00:39,689 --> 00:00:42,659
But you don't have to, if you come with me.

19
00:00:42,659 --> 00:00:43,659
What are you doing?

20
00:00:43,659 --> 00:00:46,060
I'm ace now, and we are fated.

21
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:50,090
Chosen for each other by the moon goddess.

22
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:52,009
She belongs with me now.

23
00:00:52,009 --> 00:00:53,329
Ah!

24
00:00:53,329 --> 00:00:55,420
Oh!

25
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:57,420
What the fuck?
