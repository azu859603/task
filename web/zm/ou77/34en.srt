1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Blake, wait!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,190
I knew this would happen.

3
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:06,190
I knew your mate would come and take you away.

4
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:08,609
I just didn't think it'd be him.

5
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:09,609
I don't care about him.

6
00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:10,609
Well, I do.

7
00:00:10,609 --> 00:00:13,699
I hate the way your heart beats fast and you get all numb when you're around him.

8
00:00:13,699 --> 00:00:14,699
It makes me sick.

9
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:16,829
Yes, I felt it.

10
00:00:16,829 --> 00:00:18,829
And it was euphoric, but not.

11
00:00:18,829 --> 00:00:19,829
I feel nothing.

12
00:00:19,829 --> 00:00:22,829
It's not how the mating bond works, Tal.

13
00:00:22,829 --> 00:00:23,829
Maybe he's right.

14
00:00:23,829 --> 00:00:25,829
I did do terrible things in United Paks.

15
00:00:25,829 --> 00:00:26,829
So tell me.

16
00:00:26,829 --> 00:00:29,829
Tell me every single table thing you have ever done.

17
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:33,950
And I will love you anyway, because I do.

18
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:36,950
I love you, Blake Hunter.

19
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:39,020
I don't want to be with you.

20
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:40,020
I don't want to be with him.

21
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,020
I, the white wolf, has chosen you.

22
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:44,020
So you're going to be the king.

23
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:47,990
Hey, Tal.

24
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:50,090
You're my weakness now.

25
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:51,090
He knows that.

26
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:53,090
And Ace is going to use it against us.

27
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:57,299
Anything, everything right now.

28
00:00:57,299 --> 00:00:58,490
But I can't lose you.

29
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:00,490
You're not going to lose me.

30
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:01,899
You don't know that.

31
00:01:01,899 --> 00:01:02,899
I do.

32
00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:04,900
Because we're going to take Ace,

33
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,900
and he'll cast him together.
