00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:05.309
How they might have fallen

2
00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:11.019
Perverbs it's time for a new dark moon wolf if he betrayed ice he would betray us

3
00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:13.750
He can't be trusted

4
00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:19.510
You need to show them your power show them that you are as strong as you were before the outcast war

5
00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:21.870
Is it true? Did you betray the ace?

6
00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:34.030
You know what I find it's funny since the first wolf baby us alphas have been killing each other for what?

7
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.920
Territory pride if you ask me it's a waste of time

8
00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:47.100
But today yourself righteous as a sit in front of me like you're better than me. Well, you're not

9
00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.020
Each one of you has as much blood as hands. I got

10
00:00:51.500 --> 00:01:02.380
Well, that told him I want to unite the wolves of the west coast

11
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.060
Your east coast is safe

12
00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.700
It's got no interest to me

13
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.459
Purpose is stays the one who is this time for the white wolf will become

14
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.180
King of all kind correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't that ace?

15
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.620
It seems like we are back in the wrong course

16
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.140
No, the privacy of the white wolf states

17
00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:28.859
Who the white wolf chooses?

18
00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:34.879
Who be the king of our wolf kind correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe that's me

19
00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:37.870
not ace

20
00:01:38.129 --> 00:01:40.129
Makes no difference

21
00:01:40.129 --> 00:01:44.290
Hunter I will accept nobody is making not ace not you I

22
00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.120
Want to unite the wolf packs because we're a dying species

23
00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:56.359
There's only three thousand of us left on the west coast. It's not our problem, but it will be

24
00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:59.019
What do you think they're gonna do when they get to us?

25
00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.420
They're coming for you and you and you and all the people you love I

26
00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.169
come from the far off Egyptian wolf clan and we

27
00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.990
Stand with Blake

28
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.349
Against the outcasts, you know, we all serve the moon goddess

29
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.860
Not one of you can question that

30
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.490
And not one of you will

31
00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:39.719
Thank you, brother. Thank you. I'll support your signature and he'll help me go

32
00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:48.419
No, you'll never hurt myself. What about the other alphas of California?

33
00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:52.259
It's only a matter of time before they partner with ace

34
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.250
lead enemy
