1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Damn, bro.

2
00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:07,000
Then Egyptian shit was pretty good, and I thought I lost him, right?

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,259
He looks...

4
00:00:08,259 --> 00:00:10,800
You need to make them fear you.

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,800
Tell us so.

6
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,800
I don't want them to fear me.

7
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,500
I want them to respect.

8
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,570
We'll then make them respect you.

9
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:20,570
How did Ace even get into that wedding anyway?

10
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:22,570
Wasn't it invitation only?

11
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:23,570
Yeah.

12
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:25,570
It seems like he wasn't that at all.

13
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,949
Not physically, anyway.

14
00:00:27,949 --> 00:00:29,949
That's impossible.

15
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:34,170
What the...

16
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,350
No.

17
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:38,640
Not impossible.

18
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,640
Emma.

19
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,640
Ah, shit.

20
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,929
Now you're in trouble.

21
00:00:42,929 --> 00:00:45,020
Encomo, why?

22
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:46,020
Damn it.

23
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:50,020
You know I'm a reason that was there.

24
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:53,020
I don't know what's going on, boss.

25
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:56,020
You know you're not a reason that was there.

26
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:59,020
I don't know what's going on, boss.

27
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:02,020
You know you're not a reason that was there.

28
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,019
I don't know what's going on.
