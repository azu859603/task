1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:03,240
Blake! He really doesn't know anything.

2
00:00:09,859 --> 00:00:14,560
It's exactly what Emma wanted. Your child.

3
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,559
Then why wouldn't she just use Ace?

4
00:00:18,489 --> 00:00:27,339
How could you understand?

5
00:00:27,339 --> 00:00:28,339
What you mean?

6
00:00:28,339 --> 00:00:31,339
Because of you, I almost had to kill my best friend.

7
00:00:31,339 --> 00:00:36,340
Kill him! He'll only betray you a little. You can punish him, but killing him.

8
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:40,340
That's my point, Tal. You betrayed me too. Now I'm going to kill you.

9
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:44,340
You defy me at every turn. How does that make me look in front of my men?

10
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:55,420
How about I join Ace, just like Emily? How will that make you look?

11
00:00:55,420 --> 00:01:04,049
He wants you. An eye for an eye.

12
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:06,049
What is that supposed to mean?

13
00:01:06,049 --> 00:01:09,140
Don't tell her. It doesn't know good.

14
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:11,140
Yeah, way too late for that.

15
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:14,140
Back when I left Dylan to die. His wife was pregnant.

16
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:17,560
She had a hard labor. She was bleeding out.

17
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,040
I guess he didn't make it back to her in time.

18
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:26,260
His wife, your sister died because of me, Tal.
