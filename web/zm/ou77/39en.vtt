00:00:05.419 --> 00:00:07.519
Are you sure?

2
00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:09.769
Sir.

3
00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:11.769
I'm well acquainted with this condition.

4
00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:17.539
I'll leave this with you.

5
00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:18.539
Thank you.

6
00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:25.859
Keep an eye on her, Luna.

7
00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.859
A werewolf pregnancy is not easy for a human.

8
00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:36.259
Let alone a witch.

9
00:00:36.259 --> 00:00:38.869
Why did you tell me?

10
00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:39.869
Tell you what.

11
00:00:39.869 --> 00:00:41.869
That you were pregnant with Massimo's child.

12
00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:43.869
Grandkin sends the father.

13
00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:45.969
And I think I can too.

14
00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:46.969
Hello.

15
00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:48.130
Be serious, Emma.

16
00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.130
You were trying to get late like two days ago.

17
00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:55.250
Blake broke my heart.

18
00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.570
And Massimo put it back together again.

19
00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.600
Well, maybe there is some hope for us.

20
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.599
Kind of like your control.
