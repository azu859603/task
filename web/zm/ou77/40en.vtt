00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.720
Blake, slow down. What happened?

2
00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.549
Ace, that's what happened.

3
00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:06.950
You're not making any sense.

4
00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.460
Ace got the mountain tails.

5
00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.410
Not just that. He slaughtered them.

6
00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.369
The people I swore to protect.

7
00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:16.980
The mountain tails. One line.

8
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.019
The crease in the back.

9
00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:21.359
Isn't that a better option?

10
00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.260
No, Emma hated the mountain tails for a long time now.

11
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
They enslaved her, beat her.

12
00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.260
This way she gets two for one.

13
00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:32.960
We can meet and get rid of them.

14
00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.240
Let me ask you, why are you so obsessed with her?

15
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.659
It's not me who obsessed with her.

16
00:00:38.659 --> 00:00:40.820
She's a fucking level me.

17
00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.579
You know it's funny because

18
00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:44.659
she just told me that she loved Masson

19
00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:48.189
just a few moments ago when she happened in my toilet.

20
00:00:48.189 --> 00:00:50.990
What? She's here in my house. You didn't tell me?

21
00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:52.909
You know, there's so much drama in here.

22
00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:55.229
I can not get back with all this bullshit.

23
00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:57.759
Matt, you're fucking nuts.

24
00:00:57.759 --> 00:00:59.520
Blake!

25
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:14.689
You hurt your ass with the breeze.

26
00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:16.989
He never betrayed you.

27
00:01:16.989 --> 00:01:17.790
Not to be.

28
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.909
So you're still the coward?

29
00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.469
He loved you, loved you.

30
00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:25.390
Just as I did.

31
00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.349
You speak of betrayed.

32
00:01:30.349 --> 00:01:34.030
But it is actually you who betrayed the people who love you

33
00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.629
in every turn.

34
00:01:35.629 --> 00:01:38.430
Masson, me, and Natalia.

35
00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.629
Natalia.

36
00:01:39.629 --> 00:01:43.150
Don't you say Natalia's name.

37
00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.549
I see Mo won't talk to me anymore.

38
00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.260
I guess he win.

39
00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:51.459
He'll win again.
