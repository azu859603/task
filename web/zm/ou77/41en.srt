1
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:05,290
Oh, I can get used to this.

2
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:10,480
There isn't much point, not if you can't convince the LIL first to fight alongside you.

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,980
Ah, Jackson!

4
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:19,719
My dear friend, come sit, sit, please.

5
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:23,719
Your non-civilized monster, like Blake Hunter, knows how to welcome his guests.

6
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:26,260
A poly chase.

7
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:29,420
How does an Irish small single sound like?

8
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:31,420
My mouth watering already.

9
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:34,420
Well, I thank you for your prior services.

10
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:40,079
A word for cash, not whiskey.

11
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,079
Spit it out.

12
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:49,979
I thought you'll be grateful for someone like me who turned you and made you into the alpha of your cursed rich pack.

13
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:50,979
Ace?

14
00:00:50,979 --> 00:00:52,039
Or is it Dylan?

15
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:54,039
You're a fucking outcast too.

16
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:55,039
We're equal.

17
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,039
So no need for me to thank you every time we meet.

18
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:06,590
Well, Blake Hunter has married Natalia White.

19
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:08,590
Won't be long until he's declared himself king.

20
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:10,590
No, no, no, no, no.

21
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:11,590
It's not a king.

22
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:13,590
You'll never be.

23
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,590
Natalia White is my mate.

24
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:18,810
Is that a joke?

25
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:21,870
You're a rogue alpha with an army of rejects.

26
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:22,870
What's your plan?

27
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:24,870
No, like a beautiful dove.

28
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:26,870
Natalia White is incaged.

29
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:31,939
A cage may be made of gold, but it's the cage nevertheless.

30
00:01:31,939 --> 00:01:36,969
First, I plan to set her free and then mark hers as my mate.

31
00:01:36,969 --> 00:01:39,030
And declare yourself as king.

32
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:40,030
No, no, no, no.

33
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:47,099
Before I take everything Blake Hunter has and make him watch me take everything he loves.

34
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:50,099
Then I'll kill him and declare myself a king.

35
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:53,790
What's in it for me?

36
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:57,790
Well, I suppose if you support me, I give you my word.

37
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:59,790
Your pack will be never attempted.

38
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,790
We'll never seize.

39
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:08,789
And as long as I live and as long as my beautiful children lives, your pack is sacred.

40
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:10,789
Why could there be a fucking word?

41
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:16,520
The way I see it, Jackson, you have two choices.

42
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:25,340
Trust me or wait for Blake Hunter to come and kill you.

43
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,340
You're right.

44
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,340
We need to put an end to Blake Hunter once and for all.

45
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,039
Say no more.

46
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:34,000
Let's change to that.
