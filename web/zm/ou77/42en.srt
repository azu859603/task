1
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:05,349
Yeah, I've got food in here, Billie.

2
00:00:05,349 --> 00:00:07,580
I know. I gave you a head slot.

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:08,580
Oh, you did it.

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,580
Everyone knows you got the short and the sick in all areas.

5
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:15,580
Hey, that's it. I haven't hit puberty yet.

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,219
I didn't cheat.

7
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:20,219
Yeah, you were a cheater.

8
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:21,219
Oh, man.

9
00:00:21,219 --> 00:00:28,050
You don't do anything just to get ahead of me.

10
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:29,050
You know?

11
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:30,210
What are you doing?

12
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,210
Looking at my kingdom.

13
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:33,210
Your kingdom?

14
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,210
Who do you think you are, Simba?

15
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:36,210
Yeah, so.

16
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:37,590
I will be king.

17
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:40,659
And when I'm king, you'll still be nothing.

18
00:00:40,659 --> 00:00:45,259
You know, for a werewolf to be a king, it's impossible.

19
00:00:45,259 --> 00:00:47,259
You have to unite all of the packs.

20
00:00:47,259 --> 00:00:50,810
If you can dream it, anything's possible.

21
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:52,810
Would you get that from Oprah?

22
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:54,810
Yeah, that's what I like over there.

23
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:56,810
Unless you talk so much.

24
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:58,810
And you don't fuck face.

25
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:01,700
You know?

26
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,980
I didn't mean it.

27
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:05,980
But you mean what?

28
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:07,980
When I said I'll be king,

29
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:09,980
there'll be nothing.

30
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:13,159
Because no matter what,

31
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:15,290
you'll be my little brother.

32
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:46,409
And that's something.

33
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:47,409
I'm answering.

34
00:01:47,409 --> 00:01:48,409
Maybe it's for the best.

35
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:50,629
It's how you being gone.

36
00:01:50,629 --> 00:01:52,629
It is her who makes you weak.

37
00:01:52,629 --> 00:01:53,659
No.

38
00:01:53,659 --> 00:01:55,730
It is she who makes me strong.

39
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:56,730
You've changed.

40
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:59,819
That's what happens when you fall in love Aries.

41
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:00,819
Boy.

42
00:02:00,819 --> 00:02:07,390
It's how you?

43
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:10,409
What the fuck do you want?
