1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,209
I can't talk about it, it's too painful.

2
00:00:02,209 --> 00:00:06,209
If you cannot talk about my sister, we have nothing to talk about.

3
00:00:06,209 --> 00:00:09,210
Oh, but we have so much more to talk about.

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:15,109
Bless him.

5
00:00:15,109 --> 00:00:17,109
I've got eyes on lace.

6
00:00:17,109 --> 00:00:20,460
All right, stay close, but stay safe.

7
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,460
And Natalya's here too.

8
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:26,940
Looks like there's square now.

9
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:28,940
You've listened for yourself.

10
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:31,699
You know what?

11
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:33,700
Once upon a time, I was like,

12
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,700
I hate little girl, but guess what?

13
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,799
I grew up, and now I'm not buying your bullshit.

14
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:41,799
And what bullshit is that?

15
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:45,799
You're acting like your hands are not as lusty as books.

16
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:47,799
But you've killed people, a lot of people.

17
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:51,799
My family, my friends, my pack included.

18
00:00:51,799 --> 00:00:56,799
Yeah, sorry about that, but rise to power to man's sacrifice.

19
00:00:56,799 --> 00:00:58,799
Especially when you're fighting monster like that.

20
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:02,799
A monster is not a monster when you're rewarding.

21
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:04,799
Little Blake is not a monster.

22
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,799
You're mine, not his.

23
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,799
If you're not coming with me really, I'll take you my headphones.
