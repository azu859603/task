00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.049
You're mine, not his. If you're not coming with me willingly, I'll take you by force.

2
00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:07.620
Try.

3
00:00:09.619 --> 00:00:13.449
No, I can't.

4
00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:15.449
You're not scared, little she will.

5
00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:16.449
Are you?

6
00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:21.050
Stop, stop, stop. Fine, I'll tell you.

7
00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.429
Blake, he killed your sister.

8
00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:25.429
My wife.

9
00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:30.559
You mean she died in childbirth, because you were not there to deliver.

10
00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:34.460
You know you little girl, we have midwives for that.

11
00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:42.450
No, he slaughtered my pregnant wife. Elizabeth, cold blood.

12
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:54.619
No.

13
00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:55.619
Let's go!

14
00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:57.619
Blake, we needed that to Elizabeth.

15
00:00:57.619 --> 00:01:02.619
Emma, Emma, Emma, there's no time for that. She's gonna go, hit the town.

16
00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:08.140
Well, we have to get her to the safe house before she wakes up.

17
00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.689
What was that?

18
00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:14.689
Is that one of Blake's men?

19
00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:15.689
Of course not.

20
00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.069
Don't cross me, you bitch!

21
00:01:18.069 --> 00:01:20.069
Oh, you have no idea what's coming for you.

22
00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:26.230
You have no idea. I'm gonna do to you worse than what the mountain tales did to you.

23
00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.230
Run before I get you.

24
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:29.230
Get off!
