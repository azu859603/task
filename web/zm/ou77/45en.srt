00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:07,280
Like what happened? I was just talking with Emma. Elma! Look at Elma!

2
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,539
Told me she was an aces. Oh, now you're an aces squad?

3
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:17,760
Did you just shut the fuck up? You need to drop this whole thing you've got about humans and about Emma.

4
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:25,879
Deep down she's not evil man, and I'm not out to get you. I'm not against you. How many times does that fucking prove myself?

5
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:31,820
Just listen. Elma told me math at aces. She's in trouble, bro. We got to go.

6
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:38,140
What the fuck happened to dad? I don't know. We got a tip off. She's over at that old place with the mounds hills.

7
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:52,890
I guess I'm all I know I'm allowed to handle sometimes, but you're my true brother. Let's go kill that motherfucker.

8
00:00:53,630 --> 00:01:03,810
It's the only way to protect her and Emma. I've always supported your love every time. I need you here to support me through this.

9
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:12,549
She's on our side, man. Trust me. If he touches Emma, I'm gonna rip out of the test.
