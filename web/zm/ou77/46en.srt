1
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:05,500
I sense Luna is not in good hands.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:07,799
Grandma, she's in danger.

3
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:09,800
We need to find out all these whereabouts.

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,800
I need a talisman.

5
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:29,179
Grandma, what is it?

6
00:00:29,179 --> 00:00:31,179
The goddess has blessed us.

7
00:00:31,179 --> 00:00:32,179
Blessed us?

8
00:00:32,179 --> 00:00:33,179
How?

9
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:35,179
She's with cubs.

10
00:00:35,179 --> 00:00:36,179
cubs?

11
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:38,179
Like multiple?

12
00:00:38,179 --> 00:00:39,369
Yes!

13
00:00:39,369 --> 00:00:42,369
But no wolf has had a litter in over four decades.

14
00:00:42,369 --> 00:00:45,369
Well, Natalia is no ordinary wolf.

15
00:00:45,369 --> 00:00:47,500
What did you see, Allison?

16
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:52,500
I saw three children running free in wolf form.

17
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,810
This is your future, Blake.

18
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:58,810
Grandma, cubs can't transform until they're of age.

19
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:00,810
Well, yours can.

20
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,810
You must find her now.

21
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:05,810
That's what we want to know.

22
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:06,810
Where the hell is she?

23
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:13,049
In an abandoned building on Crescent Lane,

24
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:16,049
at the foothills of mountain tales.

25
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:18,819
That's it.

26
00:01:18,819 --> 00:01:20,819
Let's get that bastard brother of mine.

27
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:21,819
Go!
