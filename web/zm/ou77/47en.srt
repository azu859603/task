1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,100
Talk to me. What's the move?

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:06,950
Oh, this.

3
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:14,380
Keep doing.

4
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:19,750
The House of Hunter is a pure bloodline.

5
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,750
We have certain invorabilities.

6
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,750
You drink this, you'll have one too.

7
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:29,210
Fuck it.

8
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:30,210
Something you should know.

9
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:43,189
No, you're only supposed to keep not Natalia, not me.

10
00:00:43,189 --> 00:00:45,189
You forgot?

11
00:00:45,189 --> 00:00:49,409
What good is a human to you anyways?

12
00:00:49,409 --> 00:00:51,020
You're all right.

13
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:54,359
But you're a witch.

14
00:00:54,359 --> 00:01:00,329
And you betrayed me.

15
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:02,329
Witches be witches.

16
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:03,329
What can I say?

17
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:19,629
Wait for these hours soon.

18
00:01:19,629 --> 00:01:20,629
The Blake Hunter.

19
00:01:20,629 --> 00:01:22,629
And the Dark Moon Pack will be ours.

20
00:01:22,629 --> 00:01:25,629
Blake Hunter and the hierarchy will be no more.

21
00:01:25,629 --> 00:01:30,349
Let's choose to that.

22
00:01:30,349 --> 00:01:40,310
Blake Hunter.

23
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:42,310
And the Dark Moon Pack will be ours.

24
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:45,310
Blake Hunter and the hierarchy will be no more.

25
00:01:45,310 --> 00:02:03,310
Still going to puberty?

26
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:04,310
Fuck you, Blakey.

27
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:34,300
You're not?

28
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,300
What am I?

29
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:38,159
Who is Blake?

30
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:48,340
It isn't humans, huh?

31
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,569
I thought you were better than that.

32
00:02:50,569 --> 00:02:51,569
Innocent.

33
00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:53,569
No humans are innocent.

34
00:02:53,569 --> 00:02:55,569
You thought me that well.

35
00:02:55,569 --> 00:02:57,569
It seems like your balls have dropped.

36
00:02:57,569 --> 00:02:58,569
You've changed.

37
00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:01,719
You're the one who's changed.

38
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:03,719
Oh, I have changed, huh?

39
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:05,780
You left me to die!

40
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:06,780
You left Mom to die!

41
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,780
Oh, I left my mom to die, huh?

42
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:12,780
I remember that when you left her, I saw her in my own eye.

43
00:03:12,780 --> 00:04:03,069
He told me to kill my sister with your bare hands.

44
00:04:03,069 --> 00:04:04,069
Is that true?

45
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:06,969
No.

46
00:04:06,969 --> 00:04:08,860
You promise?

47
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:28,750
I trust you.

48
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:29,750
I came back.

49
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:30,750
You'll be gone for a minute.

50
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,750
I brought you a healer.

51
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,750
Can you fix it?

52
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,750
Long time no see, young wolf.

53
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:36,750
Wherever?

54
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:40,769
This is bad.

55
00:04:40,769 --> 00:04:41,769
Did Blake do this to you?

56
00:04:41,769 --> 00:04:42,769
Yes.

57
00:04:42,769 --> 00:04:45,769
If there's anyone who can heal you, it's her.

58
00:04:45,769 --> 00:04:47,089
The white wolf?

59
00:04:47,089 --> 00:04:48,439
Never!

60
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:49,439
Never!

61
00:04:49,439 --> 00:05:18,279
You're all right.

62
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:19,279
You fainted.

63
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:25,379
Massimo brought you here.

64
00:05:25,379 --> 00:05:27,540
Oh, you can sense it.

65
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:30,579
Yes.

66
00:05:30,579 --> 00:05:31,579
Like his mother.

67
00:05:31,579 --> 00:05:35,829
You're a little not too far into you.

68
00:05:35,829 --> 00:05:37,829
I can sense it.

69
00:05:37,829 --> 00:05:39,220
Yes.

70
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,220
But a little different.

71
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,220
Different?

72
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,220
How?

73
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:47,220
Let's just say I have certain abilities that the white wolf doesn't have.

74
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,220
And vice versa.

75
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:50,889
Can I ask you a question?

76
00:05:50,889 --> 00:05:52,269
Of course.

77
00:05:52,269 --> 00:06:00,759
Have you ever delivered health human, health wolf baby before?

78
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:01,759
Once.

79
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:04,759
And what happened to the baby?

80
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:07,430
I was totally fine.

81
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:08,430
That the mother?

82
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:13,660
She didn't make it.

83
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,500
She died.

84
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,500
But I died too.

85
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,500
That I do not know.

86
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:27,949
The baby is fine.

87
00:06:27,949 --> 00:06:30,939
Her body is struggling.

88
00:06:30,939 --> 00:06:31,939
She needs rest.

89
00:06:31,939 --> 00:06:33,939
Oh, I'll make sure she does.

90
00:06:33,939 --> 00:06:46,759
You know all that's her we are.

91
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:50,029
Don't.

92
00:06:50,029 --> 00:06:51,029
You know what hurts me most?

93
00:06:51,029 --> 00:06:53,829
You're someone like magic.

94
00:06:53,829 --> 00:06:55,060
And fact yourself.

95
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:58,500
You know, I'm a jealousy.

96
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,500
Kills everything around it.

97
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,069
You were just too reckless.

98
00:07:03,069 --> 00:07:05,740
I liked you.

99
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,379
I could win.

100
00:07:07,379 --> 00:07:10,139
We were good friends.

101
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:14,139
It's just when you threatened to take away Blake.

102
00:07:14,139 --> 00:07:15,139
We were friends.

103
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:18,459
And the best of friends.

104
00:07:18,459 --> 00:07:21,459
I just wish that you could have been more honest with me.

105
00:07:21,459 --> 00:07:24,709
Well, I wish I didn't sleep with Massimo.

106
00:07:24,709 --> 00:07:27,060
It wouldn't be dying right now.

107
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,060
You are not dying anymore.

108
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:31,060
It's easy for you to say.

109
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:35,060
You have brain and women freaking white wolf baby.

110
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:37,930
Actually, I am.

111
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:38,930
You are?

112
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:42,269
I am pregnant.

113
00:07:42,269 --> 00:07:43,269
Yes.

114
00:07:43,269 --> 00:07:46,100
Of course it's Blake's.

115
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:49,100
Unlike you, I can focus on one ticker at a time.

116
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:52,259
Come on, that's not my point.

117
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:58,939
Well, obviously you're this powerful, pure, blood, white wolf.

118
00:07:58,939 --> 00:08:03,129
And I'm just weak friend human.

119
00:08:03,129 --> 00:08:06,129
He's gonna get killed by the embryo inside of me.

120
00:08:06,129 --> 00:08:09,949
It's already fittest.

121
00:08:09,949 --> 00:08:13,100
How long will I be pregnant for?

122
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,899
It's not a new song.

123
00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:17,899
Probably through it.

124
00:08:17,899 --> 00:08:21,000
I don't want to die in it for you.

125
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
You're not gonna die.

126
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Promise you.

127
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:41,710
Hey, Blake.

128
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:45,690
Thank you so much.

129
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:49,029
You were so good, sorry.

130
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:51,029
Are you sure you've been working out while you're pregnant?

131
00:08:51,029 --> 00:08:54,509
Well, if I'm gonna throw three babies out, yes.

132
00:08:54,509 --> 00:08:59,649
How's Emma?

133
00:08:59,649 --> 00:09:00,649
Not good, you know?

134
00:09:00,649 --> 00:09:01,649
She's a human.

135
00:09:01,649 --> 00:09:03,649
She has a wolf baby.

136
00:09:03,649 --> 00:09:05,649
It's never good.

137
00:09:05,649 --> 00:09:06,649
I'm sure she'll be okay.

138
00:09:06,649 --> 00:09:09,100
She got Massimo Watson there.

139
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:12,059
I've been thinking about it for a while.

140
00:09:12,059 --> 00:09:13,059
Oh, shit.

141
00:09:13,059 --> 00:09:14,059
That's never good.

142
00:09:14,059 --> 00:09:15,059
Oh, shut up.

143
00:09:15,059 --> 00:09:17,059
I think we should turn her.

144
00:09:17,059 --> 00:09:18,570
What?

145
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:19,570
Turn a human?

146
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:21,759
You know how I feel about that?

147
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:22,759
It blew us the bloodline.

148
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:25,460
I thought you were a new man.

149
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:29,460
What about the Massimo in his speech that he made before they all cast?

150
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,460
Wasn't that your idea?

151
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,460
I never said that.

152
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,460
That was him.

153
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:33,460
Whatever.

154
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,460
Let them think what they want.

155
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,460
Keeps them out of my hair.

156
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,460
But Blake.

157
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:39,129
You know what?

158
00:09:39,129 --> 00:09:41,129
Well, deal don't we get there?

159
00:09:41,129 --> 00:09:43,539
You just focus on getting ready, all right?

160
00:09:43,539 --> 00:10:02,250
I've missed you every day.

161
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,950
You know he would play something, don't you?

162
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:06,139
It doesn't matter.

163
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:08,529
We got the Cursed Ridge pack.

164
00:10:08,529 --> 00:10:10,529
We're one step closer to your knight in all the backs.

165
00:10:10,529 --> 00:10:15,070
The best way to unite them is why you're knighted.

166
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:18,539
What do you mean?

167
00:10:18,539 --> 00:10:20,539
I don't like it can be with packs.

168
00:10:20,539 --> 00:11:02,870
Like the Cursed Ridge or not guests.

169
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:11,940
Head off of the Hunter Bloodline.

170
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:21,190
But you also possess the strength of the White.

171
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:31,419
I can't eat my own pack.

172
00:11:31,419 --> 00:12:15,590
Don't get carried away on skinny.

173
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:19,230
Aren't you supposed to put on ways when you're pregnant?

174
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:27,179
He's just not talking.

175
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:31,220
We are so cute when you're awkward.

176
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:42,659
Mate.

177
00:12:42,659 --> 00:12:45,350
But I gotta go.

178
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:46,639
Soon.

179
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:47,639
Massimo.

180
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:58,909
I'll do that.

181
00:12:58,909 --> 00:12:59,909
And I need you sharp.

182
00:12:59,909 --> 00:13:00,909
Ready.

183
00:13:00,909 --> 00:13:04,649
I can't have you preoccupied with some human girl.

184
00:13:04,649 --> 00:13:07,450
She's not just some human girl.

185
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:08,450
All right, she's my mate.

186
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:10,740
My wolf chose her.

187
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:11,740
I heard.

188
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:15,620
How is this even possible?

189
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,850
I don't know.

190
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:19,850
But what I do know is, the mating bond is strong.

191
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:20,850
Powerful.

192
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:23,980
And it can make you do some crazy shit.

193
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:24,980
Trust me.

194
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:25,980
Yeah, I know.

195
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:32,710
Tonight we're going to Curse Ridge.

196
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:35,320
Stand with me, brother.

197
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,830
Fight by my side.

198
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:42,529
If we both survive, I'll go with you to save your girl.

199
00:13:42,529 --> 00:14:03,240
Alpha, man.

200
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,429
Why do you care?

201
00:14:04,429 --> 00:14:07,429
Curse Ridge back is now yours. Congratulations.

202
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:09,820
I'm no longer a threat to you, man.

203
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:10,820
Not so fast.

204
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,820
The party's just getting started.

205
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,159
I'm your ally now.

206
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:17,159
That's not what you're in a wolf is saying.

207
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:20,190
It's telling me that you might regroup.

208
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:22,539
A little army against us.

209
00:14:22,539 --> 00:14:23,539
I don't know.

210
00:14:23,539 --> 00:14:24,539
What do you think, Massimo?

211
00:14:24,539 --> 00:14:29,539
Well, we definitely can't have you being a martyr of race either.

212
00:14:29,539 --> 00:14:32,340
You are a part of these lands.

213
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:36,559
This has nothing to do with you.

214
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:37,559
That's funny.

215
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:39,659
I'm a pure blood just like you.

216
00:14:39,659 --> 00:14:41,230
Oh, wait, though.

217
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:45,379
You smell different.

218
00:14:45,379 --> 00:14:46,379
You wanted them turned, huh?

219
00:14:46,379 --> 00:15:06,779
I ain't got shit doing shit.

220
00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:13,860
Jackson.

221
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:34,409
Does this mean that hundred other alpha can treat you the dual?

222
00:15:34,409 --> 00:15:35,409
That's all.

223
00:15:35,409 --> 00:15:36,409
Make it.

224
00:15:36,409 --> 00:15:37,409
What it does?

225
00:15:37,409 --> 00:15:38,440
All of us.

226
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,529
It's good.

227
00:15:40,529 --> 00:15:41,850
Shoot me.

228
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:42,850
You know who this is?

229
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:43,850
Blake Hunter.

230
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:45,620
You're welcome.

231
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:55,179
If you will bow down and accept Blake as your alpha.

232
00:15:55,179 --> 00:15:59,240
Look, I know it's hard to trust someone who you don't like.

233
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,240
So let's put it this way.

234
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,240
Don't do it, it's hard.

235
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,940
Make the bow down.

236
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:08,600
Brick down.

237
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:13,299
If you really cannot accept him as your leader, you can use this door.

238
00:16:13,299 --> 00:16:15,299
So give families a few musts.

239
00:16:15,299 --> 00:16:16,980
You can never come back.

240
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:24,379
You're bound.

241
00:16:24,379 --> 00:16:26,820
Us.

242
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,139
All hail the king.

243
00:16:29,139 --> 00:16:58,620
I'm sorry about earlier.

244
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,580
You need me now.

245
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:04,220
And I can't keep running away.

246
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:08,220
You know, everything I've done in my life, I've done it myself alone.

247
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:13,220
So, Burf in a werewolf baby that might actually kill me, I can do that alone too.

248
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:18,539
Are you doing?

249
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:22,140
Not anymore.

250
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:34,099
You're not going to want to tell your life.

251
00:17:34,099 --> 00:17:35,099
It didn't take me.

252
00:17:35,099 --> 00:17:48,700
You know, I never thought things would actually turn out like this.

253
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:52,700
You mean you never thought it would actually unite the facts?

254
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,700
No.

255
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:56,769
I just never thought that I'd actually like you.

256
00:17:56,769 --> 00:17:58,769
You've always liked me.

257
00:17:58,769 --> 00:18:03,079
Ever since the day you sent Amethyst by a million.

258
00:18:03,079 --> 00:18:10,880
You may be a rain, but for real though, I thought that you would come back, reject my proposal,

259
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,880
to move others against me.

260
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,880
Oh, I see.

261
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,880
Where's it coming from?

262
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,420
Well, I did try to poison you anyway.

263
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:20,420
So, you finally admit it?

264
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:21,420
Well, okay.

265
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:28,420
You know, I didn't like you at first, but then when I came to my father's office and I saw you in that...

266
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,650
Tied feeder.

267
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:30,650
Red.

268
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:31,650
T-shirt.

269
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:32,650
Oh, my lord.

270
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:33,650
Suddenly.

271
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:35,650
Every worry.

272
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:36,680
Reservation.

273
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,680
And then what was I thinking?

274
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,680
That I had towards you, just now.

275
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,859
Damn.

276
00:18:43,859 --> 00:18:46,109
I wish I had that effect on everybody.

277
00:18:46,109 --> 00:18:49,140
But then, this place were killed.

278
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:55,140
It's like, if I will forgive you for providing our pack, I'm ready for the most.

279
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:58,140
It was like I was laying down.

280
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,180
Zack.

281
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,180
Oh.

282
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:03,390
Zack would be so proud of the woman you become.

283
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:05,390
I'll just say, I am.

284
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:07,390
The older you get, the softer you become.

285
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:09,390
I ain't soft.

286
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:11,390
Now, or ever.

287
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:16,869
But really though, you need to remember, I will never ever abandon you.

288
00:19:16,869 --> 00:19:21,700
Consider me, you're werewolf orpheus.

289
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:26,730
You know, I'm really glad it's you fulfilling this dream with me.

290
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:28,730
Uniting the packs.

291
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:29,730
Think about it.

292
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:30,730
We got the mountain tails.

293
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:32,730
We got the curse ridges.

294
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:34,759
All we got left are the night stalkers.

295
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:36,759
And my mother.

296
00:19:37,789 --> 00:19:39,789
I ain't worried about him.

297
00:19:39,789 --> 00:19:41,789
Ain't that right, little guys.

298
00:19:41,789 --> 00:19:44,789
When grandpa meets you, he is never going to reject this.

299
00:19:44,789 --> 00:19:47,789
You clearly don't know who my mother is, do you?

300
00:19:47,789 --> 00:19:48,789
You think I'm stubborn?

301
00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:50,789
Well, he is worse.

302
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:52,950
Where do you think I get this from?

303
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:55,950
I'm pretty sure he's not going to give up his pack that easily.

304
00:19:55,950 --> 00:20:01,769
Blake, what is this?

305
00:20:01,769 --> 00:20:11,220
I'm glad we could catch up again.

306
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:14,220
I will never forget the depth of gratitude I owe you for

307
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:17,220
entrusting your daughter to me over Blake.

308
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:20,259
If she wasn't in love with you, who knows what would have happened?

309
00:20:20,259 --> 00:20:24,259
Hey, she was always too good for me though.

310
00:20:24,259 --> 00:20:26,259
She was, wasn't she?

311
00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:29,259
But if you go back, would you do it again?

312
00:20:29,259 --> 00:20:31,450
You know, I don't know.

313
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:35,670
What Blake did to you, that was a terrible thing.

314
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:38,670
I still don't approve of their marriage.

315
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,670
I was Elizabeth, by the way.

316
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:42,740
Oh, you don't know?

317
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,740
What happened, Ace?

318
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:49,119
Well, when I found out she wasn't the white wolf,

319
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:54,410
I left her pregnant in a lot, but Blake thought it was actually his fault.

320
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:58,410
But actually, it was me who left her behind when we moved on.

321
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:03,869
At least for a hero's soul.

322
00:21:03,869 --> 00:21:08,000
It seems like you're not in contact with your children, you old man.

323
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I love you.

324
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I love you.

325
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I love you.

326
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I love you.

327
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I love you.

328
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I love you.

329
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,539
I love you.

330
00:21:19,539 --> 00:21:25,250
What is it?

331
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:37,319
It was him.

332
00:21:37,319 --> 00:21:43,670
Massimo, get the reinforcements.

333
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:45,410
It is true.

334
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:47,470
I cannot sense him.

335
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:50,079
Let's go get him.

336
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:58,569
Together.

337
00:21:58,569 --> 00:21:59,569
How much longer, healer?

338
00:21:59,569 --> 00:22:00,569
About two hours.

339
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:04,180
How did this happen so fast?

340
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:06,180
You in burst on much faster.

341
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:08,180
Their bodies can't handle the wolf pops.

342
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:10,180
But this is two weeks.

343
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:13,230
She's no, she's a witch.

344
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:15,230
Ah, the baby's coming.

345
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:17,839
What are her chances, healer?

346
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:18,839
About one in ten.

347
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:22,400
What?

348
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,400
Let's go, Massimo.

349
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,400
You have trouble.

350
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,349
This is my battle.

351
00:22:27,349 --> 00:22:34,660
For people to think.

352
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:35,720
I love you, Emma.

353
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,980
I'm not going to let you die.

354
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:40,170
I love you too, please.

355
00:22:40,170 --> 00:23:51,710
The downfall of Blake Hunter.

356
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:56,309
Just like I did to your brother.

357
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:57,309
I forgive you for that.

358
00:23:57,309 --> 00:23:58,309
It was boring.

359
00:23:58,309 --> 00:24:00,309
I forgive you for my sister.

360
00:24:00,309 --> 00:24:02,309
Because you were injured and you couldn't help her.

361
00:24:02,309 --> 00:24:05,309
But I will never forgive you for my father.

362
00:24:05,309 --> 00:24:07,309
She will never forgive you.

363
00:24:07,309 --> 00:24:09,309
Except your name.

364
00:24:09,309 --> 00:24:11,309
Oh, I've changed all right.

365
00:24:11,309 --> 00:24:14,890
I used to be naive, but now I know the truth.

366
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:17,079
Oh, the world is full of assholes.

367
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:19,079
And why shouldn't I be one of them?

368
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:25,369
Oh, well, the little white wolf is wrong away.

369
00:24:25,369 --> 00:24:55,839
Cute.

370
00:24:55,839 --> 00:24:57,420
She's perfect.

371
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:58,420
Can I have her?

372
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:01,950
She looks just like her father.

373
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:08,400
My precious baby.

374
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,490
You are so long.

375
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:39,349
I did have to take everything for you.

376
00:25:39,349 --> 00:25:42,339
You always get everything out of her.

377
00:25:42,339 --> 00:25:43,539
Okay.

378
00:25:43,539 --> 00:25:44,950
Out back.

379
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:49,130
This is why I became an outcast.

380
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:58,349
I wanted to stupid hit you, but you chose this path, Dylan.

381
00:25:58,349 --> 00:26:03,160
So did you.

382
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:16,970
And no one had better done it.

383
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:19,660
So dad did it.

384
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:28,829
All the old things pushed me this way.

385
00:26:28,829 --> 00:27:24,529
I feel so strong.

386
00:27:24,529 --> 00:27:31,480
Even that.

387
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,509
And even the shadows have stopped.

388
00:27:33,509 --> 00:27:37,759
I feel like this is the miracle we needed.

389
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:39,759
You know, I've been thinking.

390
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:41,759
You should come back with us.

391
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:44,759
Join the pack for real this time.

392
00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:49,039
You mean to be the part of your family?

393
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:50,039
Yeah.

394
00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:51,039
What do you think?

395
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:52,170
Great.

396
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:58,940
But Nick would never accept that.

397
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:01,460
Oh, Blake's changing.

398
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:02,460
I see it.

399
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,900
I mean, we are too.

400
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,029
It just takes time to do these things.

401
00:28:07,029 --> 00:28:08,029
But I know.

402
00:28:08,029 --> 00:28:09,289
As a family.

403
00:28:09,289 --> 00:28:11,609
A real family.

404
00:28:11,609 --> 00:28:13,740
We can do anything.

405
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:27,579
I'm sorry about your brother, man.

406
00:28:27,579 --> 00:28:28,579
Don't be.

407
00:28:28,579 --> 00:28:34,500
Don't be.

408
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,920
Friends of the family you choose.

409
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,049
I do think Dylan was onto something, though.

410
00:28:39,049 --> 00:28:42,420
I onto something.

411
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,420
I'm an outcast.

412
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:45,420
I bought that whole taken down the hierarchy.

413
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:47,420
Getting rid of the bureaucracy.

414
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:49,420
I mean, this whole time.

415
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:52,619
I've been making you and other guys my betas.

416
00:28:52,619 --> 00:28:54,619
But what's the point of a wolf pack?

417
00:28:54,619 --> 00:29:00,180
It's to come together to be stronger than when you're alone.

418
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:04,210
So I want to use this opportunity to formally invite you.

419
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:06,750
You want to run this pack with me?

420
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:08,259
Alpha.

421
00:29:08,259 --> 00:29:21,849
What about Emma?

422
00:29:21,849 --> 00:29:22,849
Your family's my family.

423
00:29:22,849 --> 00:29:36,769
Well, hard feelings not to give the baby the family.

424
00:29:36,769 --> 00:29:38,980
I will.

425
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:44,769
They care of real free pops as well.

426
00:29:44,769 --> 00:30:17,789
Hey, if you need any help, let me know.

427
00:30:17,789 --> 00:30:18,789
Blake Hunter.

428
00:30:18,789 --> 00:30:22,240
Alpha of the dark moon stone pack.

429
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,400
I crown you.

430
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:27,940
Alpha of all wolf kind.

431
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:30,940
And king of the tribes of California.

432
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:34,829
Natalia White.

433
00:30:34,829 --> 00:30:36,150
Luna.

434
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:39,309
Of the dark moon stone pack.

435
00:30:39,309 --> 00:30:40,309
I crown you.

436
00:30:40,309 --> 00:30:42,309
Our precious white wolf.

437
00:30:42,309 --> 00:30:43,309
Luna.

438
00:30:43,309 --> 00:30:46,309
Of all wolf kind.

439
00:30:46,309 --> 00:30:50,299
And the queen of the tribes of California.

440
00:30:50,299 --> 00:30:52,680
All heck.

441
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,349
All kings.

442
00:30:54,349 --> 00:30:55,349
And queen.

443
00:30:55,349 --> 00:31:00,930
Neil.

444
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:05,359
Before you all king and queen.

445
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:06,359
Rise.

446
00:31:06,359 --> 00:31:09,029
I'm sure you all notice.

447
00:31:09,029 --> 00:31:10,029
That we're not standing.

448
00:31:10,029 --> 00:31:11,029
We're not hiring.

449
00:31:11,029 --> 00:31:13,029
Or one is better than the other.

450
00:31:13,029 --> 00:31:16,029
But a circle where all are equal.

451
00:31:16,029 --> 00:31:19,099
Long gone are the days of a broken bureaucracy.

452
00:31:19,099 --> 00:31:23,099
No longer are we alpha's dominating betas.

453
00:31:23,099 --> 00:31:25,099
No longer are we pure plus.

454
00:31:25,099 --> 00:31:27,099
Hitting those different than us.

455
00:31:27,099 --> 00:31:29,700
Hybrids.

456
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:30,960
Turn.

457
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,470
Humans.

458
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:34,630
All are welcome here.

459
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:36,630
All are family.

460
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:38,630
What is a king?

461
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:40,180
Queen.

462
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:42,589
You are all king and queens.

463
00:31:42,589 --> 00:31:43,750
All alpha's.

464
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:44,750
All.

465
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:49,059
And together we're going to create a better world.

466
00:31:49,059 --> 00:31:54,849
In return we ask for loyalty.

467
00:31:54,849 --> 00:31:55,849
Creativity.

468
00:31:55,849 --> 00:31:59,000
And most of all love.

469
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Love each other.

470
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Respect each other.

471
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
And we will live in harmony side by side.

472
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,190
As we always say most.
