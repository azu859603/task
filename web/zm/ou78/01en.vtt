00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:44.890
Okay, Sister Matthews, thank you.

2
00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.729
We're so grateful to have the photo and heiress helping us out.

3
00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:51.969
You know, I could have given you easier work.

4
00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:55.229
No, Sister Matthews, I insist.

5
00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:59.030
I know it's not cheap to hear a cleaner, especially with the orphanage running on a

6
00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.060
deficit.

7
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:06.799
I need to take this real quick, it's my father.

8
00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:07.930
Hello?

9
00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.510
You know, watching walls at an orphanage, it's not a real job.

10
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.510
Stop spying on me, Dad.

11
00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:14.870
Get a life.

12
00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.109
I think it's time for you to return to the family business and marry your father.

13
00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:20.069
Or I can get my own job at MG Corp.

14
00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:21.549
Dad, we've been over this.

15
00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:22.549
I mean, what is this?

16
00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:23.549
The 15th century.

17
00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.390
Family influence and arranged marriages are so overrated.

18
00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.430
The last thing I need is a spoiled princess who I've never met hanging around my neck.

19
00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.790
No, I don't want this.

20
00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.189
I'm not marrying him.
