00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:03,180
Welcome to Italy.

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:07,219
I love that dress you're wearing and the heels

3
00:00:07,219 --> 00:00:09,380
and that diamond ring.

4
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:10,500
Look at that.

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,699
You and Mr. McGuire make the most perfect couple.

6
00:00:13,699 --> 00:00:15,300
I cannot wait for your wedding.

7
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,539
Oh my God.

8
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:22,140
They totally think I'm the CEO's fiance or something.

9
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,780
Take this opportunity, Kathleen.

10
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:26,579
Maybe you can use it to become Mr. McGuire's real wife.

11
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:28,059
Hey, everyone.

12
00:00:28,059 --> 00:00:30,059
Let's keep things on the down low.

13
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,100
Okay.

14
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:34,219
I don't like to brag about being a billionaire as well.

15
00:00:34,219 --> 00:00:36,020
Oh, you got it, Kate.

16
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:46,600
LAUGHTER

17
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,380
And who are you, the new janitor?

18
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,939
I know I'm one of the new interns.

19
00:00:51,939 --> 00:00:53,340
I'm happy to wear that dress.

20
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:54,340
Wow, she's doing work.
