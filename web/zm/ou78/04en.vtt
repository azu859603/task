00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.549
I got how to wear this trash to work.

2
00:00:02.549 --> 00:00:06.509
We are the most prestigious advertising firm in the world.

3
00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.589
I'm sorry, someone actually spilled their coffee on me

4
00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:09.429
on the way to work.

5
00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:10.589
I didn't have a spare.

6
00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:13.509
The sun is like scorching.

7
00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:16.789
I'm worried it's gonna like melt my silk or something.

8
00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:18.309
We'll deal with you later.

9
00:00:18.309 --> 00:00:20.230
I am so sorry Kate.

10
00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.589
Sometimes dealing with a subordinate can be a chore.

11
00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:24.429
Make this way.

12
00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.190
Oh my God, Kate is stunning.

13
00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:30.109
I wish I couldn't marry Mr. McGuire.

14
00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:33.109
I just training in a pool of cash every day.

15
00:00:33.109 --> 00:00:35.950
The janitor could only dream.

16
00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:41.659
She'd probably end up pregnant by some junkie.

17
00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:43.299
Who runs this place?

18
00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:45.740
Probably just some greedy, shallow jerk.
