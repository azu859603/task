1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,669
Ow!

2
00:00:01,669 --> 00:00:02,669
Where'd you put the necklace?

3
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:03,669
Where's the necklace, Catherine?

4
00:00:03,669 --> 00:00:04,669
What necklace?

5
00:00:04,669 --> 00:00:11,029
I literally just had it, and then Catherine told me it was missing.

6
00:00:11,029 --> 00:00:12,029
What?

7
00:00:12,029 --> 00:00:13,029
I didn't say that.

8
00:00:13,029 --> 00:00:14,029
What necklace?

9
00:00:14,029 --> 00:00:15,029
Liar.

10
00:00:15,029 --> 00:00:16,030
Just admit it.

11
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:17,030
You're nothing but a thief.

12
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:18,739
What the fuck?

13
00:00:18,739 --> 00:00:19,739
You set me up.

14
00:00:19,739 --> 00:00:20,739
Oh, Catherine.

15
00:00:20,739 --> 00:00:24,899
If you really wanted it, I would have gifted it to you.

16
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:26,739
You probably needed it more than I did after that.

17
00:00:26,739 --> 00:00:28,660
So you can make stunt you pulled.

18
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:31,350
Shut your mouth or I'll shut it for you.

19
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:36,789
That necklace was supposed to be a $10 million gift from Mr. McGuire to his fiance, a source

20
00:00:36,789 --> 00:00:37,789
of inspiration.

21
00:00:37,789 --> 00:00:39,990
But you as a peasant would know anything about that.

22
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:40,990
Oh, peasant.

23
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:47,850
Really?

24
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:48,689
She is not my fiance.
