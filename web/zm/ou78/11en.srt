1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,600
Who are you calling a peasant?

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:04,700
She is not my fiance. I never even wanted this arranged marriage.

3
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:08,000
Oh, Mr. McGuire, uh, you didn't need to come in. We, uh...

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,599
Oh, crap. Has Mr. McGuire met his fiance?

5
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:14,500
Is he gonna expose me? I should just play along.

6
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,420
Oh my god, goob. I'm finally here.

7
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,420
Find the security footage.

8
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:23,420
I need to see exactly who took the necklace.

9
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:30,219
Um, like, maybe this is all, like, a big misunderstanding.

10
00:00:30,219 --> 00:00:35,219
You know, like, I'm, like, super generous, so...

11
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:38,219
I'm okay to let it slide this time.

12
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:44,600
Hey, how about dinner? At the Morgan's.

13
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,600
I think we could all use a little break.

14
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,600
I've still got some work on my plate, but, uh, you guys...

15
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,600
What?

16
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,600
Maybe there's still a chance with her.

17
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:07,629
Wait, Morgan's, like, the three-star Michelin restaurant?

18
00:01:07,629 --> 00:01:11,629
Why is she getting so worked up about a Michelin star?

19
00:01:11,629 --> 00:01:14,629
Did they start this era set of films?

20
00:01:14,629 --> 00:01:30,750
Kate, uh, you studied in Milan?

21
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:36,879
Yeah, uh, totally. I was there for, like, five years?

22
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:41,540
Sorry to interrupt, ma'am. Are you ready to order?

23
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:46,540
Yes. Yes. I would like the lasagna.

24
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,540
Lasagna, olive, and basil.

25
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:52,730
Anything pronounce a common Italian dish?

26
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:54,730
Who is she?

27
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:56,730
I love the papa daleo, papa mijama.

28
00:01:56,730 --> 00:02:05,180
I, uh, I used to watch the soccer matches at Inter Milan San Siro Stadium.

29
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:08,180
Did you ever catch a game there?

30
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:13,780
Yeah, of course. It's, like, always packed.

31
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:18,159
Actually, San Siro is Ace Milan's stadium, not Inter Milan.

32
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:20,159
Fucking bitch.

33
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:22,159
And you are?

34
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:25,150
Catherine, nice to meet you.

35
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:49,000
Red. Come on, like, what's Italian without wine, right?

36
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,719
Ryan is picking up the bills, anyway. No way I can afford it.

37
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:58,719
Look, sorry, guy. Something came up. Enjoy your food.

38
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:05,900
How is everyone doing?

39
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,900
I will just leave the check right here whenever you're ready.

40
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:30,349
Try this one.

41
00:03:30,349 --> 00:03:39,930
Well, the clam to be.

42
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:47,430
And he will sort this out.

43
00:03:47,430 --> 00:04:24,660
I need to report my missing cookie.

44
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,579
Still the clam.

45
00:04:27,579 --> 00:04:29,959
It has to be your machine.

46
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:31,959
Maybe we should just split the bill.

47
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:33,959
But the wine alone was, like, two grand a bottle.

48
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:35,959
That's more than my monthly rent.

49
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:41,860
I'm just going to want to show you.

50
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:50,490
I'll settle the bill on that table for me.

51
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,649
Ma'am, your bill's settled.

52
00:04:52,649 --> 00:04:53,649
What?

53
00:04:53,649 --> 00:04:55,649
I guess Ryan was to call it and pay the bill.

54
00:04:55,649 --> 00:04:58,259
Let's go for one.

55
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:08,800
Actually, Mr. McGuire is fiance.

56
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,800
Seems really weird that none of our cards work last night.

57
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,800
What do you think, Mary?

58
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,800
I don't know.

59
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,800
Maybe there was some kind of mistake or something.

60
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,800
Sorry, everyone. I left way too early.

61
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,800
Yesterday.

62
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,800
Kathleen, let me pay you back for the bill.

63
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,800
Did any Catherine say that Ryan had already paid for it?

64
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,800
Um, I had a little issue with one of my cards, but one of them went through.

65
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,800
I think so.

66
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,860
No worries.

67
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,860
I shouldn't have taken care of that.

68
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,860
And sent.

69
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:44,629
McGuire's fucking blind.

70
00:05:44,629 --> 00:06:02,220
I swear.

71
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,220
She's the real heiress to the Foden family.

72
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,220
Catherine Foden.

73
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,220
David's fiance.

74
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,220
Better not reveal this yet.

75
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:11,220
If I play my cards right, she might end things with David herself.

76
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,220
David herself.

77
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:21,259
Station on the next project is coming up.

78
00:06:21,259 --> 00:06:24,420
No, I expect everything to go smooth and floss.

79
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,420
You got it?

80
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:42,660
It's going to be Wednesday.

81
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:45,660
Isn't it your turn to go get everyone in some sweets?

82
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,660
Yes, I've been craving that for you.

83
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:49,660
Especially the pistachio ones.

84
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,660
And bubble tea food chat hours?

85
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:52,660
Catherine, can you get some?

86
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:53,660
Lose some weight, guys.

87
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,660
You've just ate chocolate.

88
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,660
And you had a milkshake an hour ago.

89
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,420
Whoa.

90
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:02,420
How can some of these stingy and fat shaming at the same time?

91
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,420
Catherine.

92
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:11,589
It's MG's house rules for the interns to go get the co-workers' teas.

93
00:07:11,589 --> 00:07:13,589
Don't know, don't care.

94
00:07:13,589 --> 00:07:15,720
I forget MG to make money.

95
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,720
Not spend it on your cheat days.

96
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,720
Oh my god.

97
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,040
You can't even afford bubble tea.

98
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:26,040
Maybe I should tell Mr. McGuire's he doesn't just hire any cheap losers.

99
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,040
Stay calm, Kate.

100
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,040
It's not worth it.

101
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,040
Just do it.

102
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:33,040
Dad is going to pair you with some rich asshole if you get fired.

103
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,040
Second time, don't screw this up.

104
00:07:35,040 --> 00:08:08,209
Nice guts as you got there.

105
00:08:08,209 --> 00:08:09,720
Presentation, moral?

106
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:16,899
Sorry, I didn't mean to start with you.

107
00:08:16,899 --> 00:08:36,480
I just couldn't help but notice your work is inspired by Milton Glazer.

108
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,480
Wait.

109
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,480
You know about him?

110
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,480
Yeah, of course.

111
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,669
Eye-catching psychedelic inspired work, right?

112
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:44,669
That's all you want to talk about.

113
00:08:44,669 --> 00:08:45,669
Yeah.

114
00:08:45,669 --> 00:08:46,669
Gosh.

115
00:08:46,669 --> 00:08:48,309
He looks.

116
00:08:48,309 --> 00:08:58,049
Can't screw around with someone else's fiance.

117
00:08:58,049 --> 00:08:59,590
Here.

118
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:12,250
That's exactly what I was aiming for.

119
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,250
Thanks.

120
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,500
What?

121
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:20,500
I decided to take a long walk during work hours.

122
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,370
Don't bother coming back.

123
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:44,340
Sorry, the line was long and I thought the present was...

124
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,340
Save it.

125
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:49,340
You'd better have something great for this presentation or the boss will shit can you himself.

126
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,340
He's watching.

127
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,340
Alright.

128
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,340
It's time.

129
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:56,620
Kathleen, why don't you come up here and show us what you've got.

130
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:59,620
Seeing an ability, we will have...

131
00:10:32,019 --> 00:10:34,019
Who even are you to accuse me?

132
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:37,019
What, like, corn or gas college you go to?

133
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:38,019
Yeah.

134
00:10:38,019 --> 00:10:40,019
Why should we believe anything you say?

135
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:42,019
Who do you have to sleep with to get this internship anyway?

136
00:10:42,019 --> 00:10:44,019
You people are violent.

137
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:47,019
You're just jealous because I'm better than you.

138
00:10:47,019 --> 00:10:48,019
Yeah.

139
00:10:48,019 --> 00:10:50,019
I'm getting you fired for plagiarism.

140
00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:53,879
I know he's telling the truth.

141
00:10:53,879 --> 00:11:09,539
I know he's telling the truth.

142
00:11:09,539 --> 00:11:11,539
Ryan, please secure that.

143
00:11:11,539 --> 00:11:13,539
Ms. Catherins idea not to be your range fiance.

144
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:20,990
I think he can just order me around, David.

145
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:24,990
I heard from David, Al Ross, that Kate ran the ideas by him a couple days ago.

146
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:25,990
See guys?

147
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:26,990
I told you.

148
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:27,990
She's lying.

149
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:28,990
Not you.

150
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:31,090
I'm in Kathleen.

151
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:34,179
I'm not sure where you get your ideas from, Catherine.

152
00:11:34,179 --> 00:11:42,779
But, David, surely you mentioned you.

153
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:43,779
Clean the toilets for a week, Catherine.

154
00:11:43,779 --> 00:11:44,779
What?

155
00:11:44,779 --> 00:11:48,990
That's your punishment for lying, David.

156
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:52,990
And as for you, Kathleen, you owe me the prominent Italian designer in the Glo Constellini

157
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:53,990
and show him your designs.

158
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:55,990
How'd you use counting on me for this new deal?

159
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:58,990
I would just die to meet Nicola Constellini.

160
00:11:58,990 --> 00:11:59,990
You're so lucky.

161
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:00,990
You know what?

162
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:03,019
I'm pretty sure you can take along.

163
00:12:03,019 --> 00:12:04,019
No big deal.

164
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:06,019
You probably don't even know who Nicola is.

165
00:12:06,019 --> 00:12:08,090
As if you're going.

166
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:10,090
Mind your own business, you thief.

167
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:12,090
Yeah, go clean your toilets, loser.

168
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:39,860
This like, super famous Italian designer.

169
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:42,860
Oh my god, I feel like I'm going to be rich and famous soon

170
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,860
and own that limo that you drive your boss around them.

171
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,860
Yeah, and also, oh my god, I've been my boss.

172
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:49,860
David, I think you see him coming into me.

173
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,860
Her dad is a limo driver.

174
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,860
Guess you are not the rich girl.

175
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,860
Everyone thinks you are.

176
00:12:55,860 --> 00:13:06,450
At this, like, English designer when I was little, you know, to, like, design all my clothes.

177
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:07,450
Seriously?

178
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:10,450
I bet she has her nails done at the dollar store.

179
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:15,450
Yeah, I had, like, Barbie dresses, Gucci belts.

180
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:17,450
Here, do you want to see a picture?

181
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:18,450
Yeah.

182
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:22,639
Why don't you take everyone to go meet Nicola and your limo Kate?

183
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:25,639
I mean, I'm sure they'd love to see that grand entrance again.

184
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:27,700
Oh, yeah, can we?

185
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:28,700
Please, Kate.

186
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:32,700
Please, I've never even taken a photo in a limo.

187
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:33,700
Sure.

188
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:36,500
I mean, yeah.

189
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:58,129
Let me just go on my driver real quick, and I will see you.

190
00:13:58,129 --> 00:13:59,129
I need you to pick me up with the limo.

191
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:05,700
What?

192
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,850
If I go on a personal that I don't own the car.

193
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:13,620
Right now, or I swear to god, I'm going to jump off this building.

194
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:25,480
Oh, shortly, let's start packing up.

195
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,480
You're the best, Kate.

196
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,399
Be the warehouse peasant today.

197
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,399
Take those to Nicola.

198
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:34,389
But no, she's not coming with us.

199
00:14:34,389 --> 00:14:35,389
Ew!

200
00:14:35,389 --> 00:14:37,389
I'm so sorry, Kate, but we're short staff today.

201
00:14:37,389 --> 00:14:39,389
She'll be a good little doggy.

202
00:14:39,389 --> 00:14:41,519
I'll make sure of it.

203
00:14:41,519 --> 00:15:10,519
Please.

204
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:31,980
It's not going to be here today.

205
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:32,980
Paul.

206
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:36,379
You got it wrong.

207
00:15:36,379 --> 00:15:37,379
Let's get going, girls.

208
00:15:37,379 --> 00:15:48,320
I wish I could slap your daughter for you, Paul.

209
00:15:48,320 --> 00:16:04,620
No way.

210
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,620
Is she picking up my trash?

211
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:10,779
I threw that out for you to go.

212
00:16:10,779 --> 00:16:11,779
Wow, Kate.

213
00:16:11,779 --> 00:16:16,779
I know.

214
00:16:16,779 --> 00:16:17,779
Everyone says so.

215
00:16:17,779 --> 00:16:21,059
Wait, but the girl in this picture is brown hair.

216
00:16:21,059 --> 00:16:22,059
Does she come up?

217
00:16:22,059 --> 00:16:31,039
She must have died of it.

218
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:32,230
Oh, yeah.

219
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:33,230
I died of blonde a few years back.

220
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:35,230
It suits me better, honestly.

221
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:51,820
How do you handle this one?

222
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:58,519
Sorry, guys.

223
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:00,519
My boss needs the car.

224
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,519
You'll need to get a new bar or something.

225
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:05,930
It's gonna be my dad.

226
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:07,930
He's, like, super busy.

227
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:09,019
We'll get another car.

228
00:17:09,019 --> 00:17:22,630
Are you doing that?

229
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:24,950
What am I gonna tell my coworkers?

230
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:26,950
Why are you keeping this up, Kate?

231
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:28,950
We're not even rich.

232
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:30,950
I need a sports car.

233
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:31,950
Okay?

234
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:32,950
I don't care how you get it.

235
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:33,950
Just do it.

236
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:34,950
That's ridiculous.

237
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:36,950
I can't afford that.

238
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:38,950
It's tough enough trying to make money.

239
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:41,910
A lot of her is something, Dad.

240
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:44,259
Oh, this is how you can sell it.

241
00:17:44,259 --> 00:17:46,259
I'm sure he's a bunch of useless,

242
00:17:46,259 --> 00:17:48,259
pricey stuff laying around.

243
00:17:48,259 --> 00:18:19,180
Almost here.

244
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:23,190
I'm sure he'll send us a car.

245
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:37,829
Pilling us.

246
00:18:37,829 --> 00:18:39,829
Does Mr. McGuire come in a lot?

247
00:18:39,829 --> 00:18:42,660
Come on, Kate.

248
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:45,660
We're gonna be late for Mr. Constellini's appointment.

249
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,660
Shut up.

250
00:18:46,660 --> 00:19:02,180
Come pick us up.

251
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:05,180
David is way too busy right now.

252
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:35,140
I'll be right there.

253
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:39,799
Your fiance is in trouble, sir.

254
00:19:39,799 --> 00:19:41,799
They were on their way to the appointment

255
00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:44,799
with Nicolo Constellini and got stuck on the road.

256
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,799
I'm gonna go help them out.

257
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,799
All right, then.

258
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:51,529
Welcome with you.

259
00:19:51,529 --> 00:20:07,130
Meryl drive the rest of you.

260
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:10,220
Kathy and Catherine, you're out with us.

261
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:27,079
I don't think that you've met your fiance yet, Kathleen.

262
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:28,660
David.

263
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:31,660
I'm not really interested in our age marriage, Kathleen.

264
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:35,809
I think you should talk to your father, Mrs. Phone about it.

265
00:20:35,809 --> 00:20:36,809
Wait.

266
00:20:36,809 --> 00:20:38,809
David is the fiance dad set up for me?

267
00:20:38,809 --> 00:20:39,809
Shit.

268
00:20:39,809 --> 00:20:40,809
Are you kidding me?

269
00:20:40,809 --> 00:20:43,940
I mean, in this day and age, I just don't really see the point.

270
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,099
Do you?

271
00:20:45,099 --> 00:20:48,920
So she was pretending to be me.

272
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,920
And she's not the boss's fiance.

273
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,920
Wow.

274
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:55,920
Kathleen, you are the dumbest bitch I've ever seen.
