00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:34,159
Mr. Constellini, you are truly...

2
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:36,600
It's great to have a MG here.

3
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,920
Mary.

4
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,640
We're wonderful. Thank you very much.

5
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,640
We actually had some designs we wanted to show you.

6
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:57,759
Kathleen, would you want to show Niccolo those slides you had?

7
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:00,759
Oh, you drew inspiration from Mirton Glaser.

8
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:03,759
Are you familiar with his famous New York designs?

9
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:10,200
Oh, yeah. Big apple. You know, like, the apple theme.

10
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:20,459
I thought I'd go around and sort this out.

11
00:01:21,459 --> 00:01:23,459
Why is she still presenting?

12
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:28,980
Kathleen, please.

13
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,340
Joan's over here for a moment.

14
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:33,340
Time to save this idiot again.

15
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:35,340
David's such a jerk.
