00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I've always wanted to own my own company, you know?

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
But David's dad insists that I learn the ropes.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.130
I mean, I was the captain of my football team off of college.

4
00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:14.130
Mm-hmm.

5
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.129
You know, like that isn't enough to run a company. And David?

6
00:00:17.129 --> 00:00:20.670
Man, some of it only stabbed you in the back.

7
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.670
Really? How so?

8
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.670
Well, you know what, you're not serious about the engagement, right?

9
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.670
David just likes to, you know, play the field.

10
00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:32.670
Another one to settle down.

11
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.250
Okay.

12
00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.740
I know you're the real Keith, though, Catherine.

13
00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.030
I know who you are.

14
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.060
But I'm willing to keep your secret under one condition.

15
00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.060
And what's that?
