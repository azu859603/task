00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
We've been together for a while now.

2
00:00:03.029 --> 00:00:05.030
What? Better not keep your girl waiting.

3
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.660
Let's go.

4
00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.800
Yes, Dad?

5
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.150
How's it going with the phone, girl?

6
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.149
Oh, yeah, everything is, uh... just fine.

7
00:00:18.149 --> 00:00:20.149
Good. No need for me to call William then.

8
00:00:20.149 --> 00:00:23.149
Let's announce your engagement at the next press conference.

9
00:00:23.149 --> 00:00:26.280
Yeah? Yeah, sure, let's do it.

10
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.140
Let's do it.

11
00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.140
And that will be all on our latest financial court.

12
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.140
Does anybody have any questions?

13
00:00:34.619 --> 00:00:35.619
Yes.

14
00:00:35.619 --> 00:00:37.619
Mr. McGuire is a true leader in gay.

15
00:00:37.619 --> 00:00:39.619
Yes, I am actually.

16
00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:42.619
I am engaged to the Arizona vote family.

17
00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:45.619
Allow me to introduce Ms. Kay Foden.

18
00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:49.840
Mr. McGuire, sorry to interrupt.

19
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.840
Ms. Foden, your father's been in a car accident.
