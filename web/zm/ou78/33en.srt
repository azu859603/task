1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:02,459
Catherine.

2
00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:04,190
Fine.

3
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:09,689
I don't want to hear it.

4
00:00:09,689 --> 00:00:12,349
Dad?

5
00:00:12,349 --> 00:00:13,349
I'm okay.

6
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:17,589
It's so good to see you.

7
00:00:17,589 --> 00:00:18,660
I'm so worried.

8
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:27,030
Thank you for taking care of it, David.

9
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,019
What's wrong?

10
00:00:29,019 --> 00:00:31,019
You guys not gotten along?

11
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:32,890
No.

12
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:36,020
David here almost married the wrong fiance.

13
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:39,200
How is that even possible?

14
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,200
It was a huge misunderstanding.

15
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,200
But mostly my fault.

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,200
Don't worry.

17
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,740
Mr. Ford.

18
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:50,810
Don't take good care of her.

19
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:53,810
It's just when I thought you were against the whole arrangement.

20
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:54,939
Not anymore.

21
00:00:54,939 --> 00:00:58,979
I think I fell in love with her.
