1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:13,089
Kate, let me take you on a proper date.

2
00:00:13,089 --> 00:00:18,679
We don't have production marriage, but are you able to give me other chance?

3
00:00:18,679 --> 00:00:21,000
Why would I do that after everything that's happened?

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,769
Because I'm a man of my word.

5
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:24,890
I promise to do right by you this time.

6
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:26,620
I mean, who knows?

7
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:29,769
He might fall for me too.

8
00:00:29,769 --> 00:00:34,439
Okay, that overconfidence is not going to get you anywhere.

9
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:38,729
I'm taking that as a yes.

10
00:00:38,729 --> 00:00:44,060
Name a food that you don't like.

11
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,840
I'm a pineapple on pizza.

12
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,840
Why?

13
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,280
I'm getting that for dinner.

14
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,539
Ah!

15
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:53,590
Okay.

16
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:54,590
You are a brutal woman.

17
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:56,619
I'll do probably.

18
00:00:56,619 --> 00:00:57,619
It's just the beginning date.
