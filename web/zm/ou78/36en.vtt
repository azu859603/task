00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Mr. McGuire, are ya?

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.450
Kate?

3
00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.450
Can you talk to your fiancee for me here?

4
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.449
What's that got to do with me?

5
00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:13.449
Um, you've been bullying Catherine since they she got here.

6
00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:14.449
Are you serious?

7
00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:16.449
I've done all of this for you.

8
00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:17.449
How about you saved it?

9
00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:19.449
Captain, enough!

10
00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:22.449
Kathleen Davis, you are also fired from pursuing a cape boat

11
00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:24.449
and fooling me into thinking you might be on set.

12
00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.940
She's not the boat in air.

13
00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:30.940
Kathleen's been lying this entire time.

14
00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:31.940
Wait, wait, wait.

15
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.939
You mean, you're not.

16
00:00:33.939 --> 00:00:35.939
Mr. McGuire's fiance?

17
00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:39.939
I have done all of this for you, you funny bitch!

18
00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:52.250
Look who's the peasant now.
