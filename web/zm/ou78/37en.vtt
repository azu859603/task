00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.769
Hey everybody, show's over, get back to work.

2
00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:21.679
I don't think I can help you with Mr. Huyer.

3
00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:23.679
What about pizza?

4
00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:26.899
How about I take you out to a place I know?

5
00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:28.899
Oh, I thought you backed out.

6
00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:29.899
Never said that.

7
00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:31.899
I just need a minute to address a palette.

8
00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:35.969
Dan, is Catherine the actual Kate Foden?

9
00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.159
They do seem close together, huh?

10
00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:42.950
Mr. McGuire, our database just went down,

11
00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.950
our servers have been hacked.

12
00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:48.429
Mr. McGuire, someone has leaked their designs in,

13
00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:50.429
put them all over social media.

14
00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:53.429
Our stock market price is tight, what do we do?
