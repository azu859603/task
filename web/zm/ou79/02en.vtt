00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:08.640
You're worthless to me Lois, sign this and see the hell out of my life, and don't ever come back to this house. My house!

2
00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:17.370
Gladly, you heartless bastard.

3
00:00:17.969 --> 00:00:21.370
Marrying you was the worst decision of my life. You should have stayed with my ex.

4
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:23.370
Who Lois?

5
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:25.370
Clark, please.

6
00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:29.370
You're just a nobody, and he's a Hollywood superstar now. He doesn't want you.

7
00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:34.420
That's a good girl.

8
00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.420
Don't worry. We'll make sure to save you a proper seat at our wedding.

9
00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.179
You know what? I hope you both brought him home.

10
00:00:41.179 --> 00:00:48.039
Yeah, she's getting a divorce.

11
00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:50.039
Let's scumbag cheated on her.

12
00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.039
She's our friend, Barney.

13
00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:53.039
Let her stay until my place is ready.

14
00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.039
Understand.

15
00:00:54.039 --> 00:01:02.060
Barney's been a good friend, even after I broke up with Clark. He'll let me stay.

16
00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.969
Oh my God, Lois, what happened?

17
00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:13.540
It's Jim. He cheated, and he kicked me out, and Barney, I don't have anywhere else to go.

18
00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.540
Can he please stay with you tonight? Look, I promise. I promise I'll find somewhere else to stay tomorrow.

19
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.540
Of course. Come on in.

20
00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:26.290
Take as long as you need.

21
00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.480
Jim wasn't husband material. I'm so glad you're done with him.

22
00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.640
How's our A-lister doing?

23
00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.900
You miss him?

24
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.930
No. No. I'm just curious. I mean...

25
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.930
Actually, Lois, he's...

26
00:01:41.930 --> 00:02:02.200
His boyfriend? He's here?
