00:00:08.779 --> 00:00:10.779
What are you doing here?

2
00:00:10.859 --> 00:00:14.300
Yeah, the guy's supposed to do it.

3
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:22.629
That was the show.

4
00:00:22.629 --> 00:00:23.629
It was good.

5
00:00:23.629 --> 00:00:25.629
It ran longer than I expected.

6
00:00:25.629 --> 00:00:27.629
Which is why I'm moving away.

7
00:00:27.629 --> 00:00:32.369
Listen, I want to just say thank you for supporting me my dream.

8
00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.649
I know that you're working really hard to keep us going.

9
00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:38.649
Hey, when you make it big,

10
00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:41.649
I'll just be counting on you to make it up to me.

11
00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:42.649
Hmm.

12
00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:52.200
Okay with that.

13
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.200
So, how's Clark doing?

14
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.579
Clark's mom is sick.

15
00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:59.579
And her treatment is expensive.

16
00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.579
I think he needs our help.

17
00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:03.579
Yeah, I mean of course I'll do anything I can to help.

18
00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:05.579
Actually, I was thinking that you might.

19
00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:06.579
That's the thing.

20
00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:08.579
A big agency wants to sign Clark.

21
00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:10.579
This could be his big break.

22
00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:11.609
Barney!

23
00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:12.609
That's incredible.

24
00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:14.609
I mean this could change everything for him.

25
00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:15.609
There's a catch.

26
00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:17.609
The agency has this policy.

27
00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:20.609
They only sign actors who are single.

28
00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:23.609
So if you really love him, now's the time to decide.
