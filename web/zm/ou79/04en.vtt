00:00:03.089 --> 00:00:08.390
Happy anniversary, beautiful.

2
00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:10.580
Listen, Clark, we're done.

3
00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:15.369
Where'd you get this ring?

4
00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:17.370
I've fallen for someone else.

5
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:23.719
I thought you loved me.

6
00:00:23.719 --> 00:00:26.719
If you really loved him, now's the time to say.

7
00:00:26.719 --> 00:00:28.719
What did you expect, Clark?

8
00:00:28.719 --> 00:00:31.719
You're just a struggling actor, but Jim, Jim's rich.

9
00:00:31.719 --> 00:00:33.719
He could give me the life that you never could.

10
00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.719
What, Jim?

11
00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:37.719
Like Jim Kirby, that snobbish rich asshole

12
00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:40.719
who just flaunts his wealth in front of everyone?

13
00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:43.719
Lois, you're better than that.

14
00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:45.719
This is not up for discussion, Clark. We're done.

15
00:00:45.719 --> 00:01:17.659
Clark's here to run over a few blockbuster projects with me.

16
00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:19.299
Hi.

17
00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:24.819
In a period you have company, I'll see you at the office tomorrow.

18
00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:30.090
I mean, who can blame him?

19
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.090
Gave up the one guy I truly loved and now he's the biggest star in the country.

20
00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:49.750
And here I am, kicked out by a cheater and a liar and a jerk.

21
00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.900
Way to go, Lois.
