1
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:10,800
You are late, or have you forgotten you're not the big-shot journalist you used to be?

2
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:13,839
Is that alcohol I smell?

3
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:16,870
I'm so sorry bossy

4
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:25,820
There that should help by the way

5
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:32,380
I'm sending you back down to the entertainment desk that department is on the chopping block and I could use someone who can handle a diva

6
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:35,380
After last chance Kane don't screw this up

7
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,310
Listen up everyone

8
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:42,310
This is Lois Kane, your newest team member

9
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:48,229
Look who it is

10
00:00:48,229 --> 00:00:49,229
Is she's my new boss?

11
00:00:49,229 --> 00:00:54,259
I know you all have heard the rumors about the billionaire acquiring our magazine

12
00:00:54,259 --> 00:00:56,259
Brace yourselves, buckle up

13
00:00:56,259 --> 00:00:58,780
Are his doing it for his first love?

14
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:00,780
I wonder who the lucky girl is

15
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:05,980
Boss your dad

16
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:06,980
Boss your man

17
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:09,980
And now you're about to lose your job too

18
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:11,980
Must be tough, huh?

19
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:15,390
And once I turn the new boss

20
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:17,390
You'll be out of here for good
