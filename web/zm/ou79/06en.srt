00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,459
I'm the new boss. You'll be out of here for good.

2
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,890
You're covering it. Oh, and don't be late if you're fired.

3
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:23,190
Wait, 10 minutes?

4
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:25,149
But who's in it? I don't want him to be as a handful.

5
00:00:25,149 --> 00:00:34,840
Good luck with that.

6
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,159
First at bonus base, and now here.

7
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:39,759
I guess my first question of the day.

8
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:41,920
Why do I keep running into him?

9
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:47,259
Hello. Ground control to Mijikane?

10
00:00:47,259 --> 00:00:50,399
I apologize, Mr. Cavill.

11
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,439
Sorry, can you repeat the question?
