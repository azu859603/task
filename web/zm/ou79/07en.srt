00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Hello.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,620
I apologize Mr. Cavill, sorry, can you repeat the question?

3
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:10,380
My question was, what do you think the theme of love is in notebooks?

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:16,260
You're an entertainment journalist, so I figured you'd have some good insights, right?

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,339
Right, of course, yes.

6
00:00:18,339 --> 00:00:24,100
The main characters, they go through a rough relationship, and their love goes through

7
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:28,829
their emotions are high and low, their love.

8
00:00:29,149 --> 00:00:32,109
This all sounds pretty generic to me, don't you think?

9
00:00:32,109 --> 00:00:37,789
Maybe you don't know what true love is or miss the point of it entirely.

10
00:00:37,789 --> 00:00:45,149
What's me or just Clark have it out for her?

11
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:47,420
Why is she soaked?

12
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:49,500
Is she trying to seduce Clark or something?

13
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,259
Definitely some tension there.

14
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:53,179
I've never seen him like this.

15
00:00:53,179 --> 00:00:55,420
I appreciate your advice.

16
00:00:55,420 --> 00:01:03,490
But if I may, it's clear Ms. Kane is completely unprofessional.

17
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:08,879
She's nothing but an amateur who can't even recognize the genius of Mr. Cavill.

18
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:13,819
Let's get this incompetent reporter out of here.

19
00:01:13,819 --> 00:01:14,859
Don't touch her.
