1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:04,660
Lois Kane, you're under arrest for libel and defamation.

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:07,940
That's insane, I didn't write that!

3
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:13,339
I am so sorry Mr. Cavilla, I had no idea Lois would stoop this lab.

4
00:00:14,539 --> 00:00:16,100
You know I've never...

5
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,899
Say it for the judge, Lois.

6
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,300
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, let her go.

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,800
No, I said let her go.

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,300
Sir!

9
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,300
I said let her go!

10
00:00:26,019 --> 00:00:27,019
Party handle this.

11
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:30,420
Ladies and gentlemen, have an announcement.

12
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:34,420
As of today, Clark Cavill is the new owner of Daily Globe.

13
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:38,979
Holy shit, he's my boss now.

14
00:00:38,979 --> 00:00:44,500
And, as the new owner, I will make sure that this gets thoroughly investigated.

15
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:50,289
As the new owner, I will make sure that this gets thoroughly investigated.

16
00:00:50,289 --> 00:00:52,289
What the hell is he up to?

17
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:54,289
Check the timestamp on the article.

18
00:00:54,289 --> 00:00:57,289
It says it was published around the same time Lois and I were trapped in the storage room.

19
00:00:57,289 --> 00:01:00,289
Clearly, this is some sort of setup.

20
00:01:00,289 --> 00:01:02,289
Maybe...

21
00:01:02,289 --> 00:01:04,290
Maybe she's scheduled it in advance.

22
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:07,290
Well, let's check the security footage in that channel.

23
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,290
That'll look great things up.

24
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:12,450
Mr. Cavill, the security system has been compromised.

25
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,450
All of the footage is gone.

26
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:22,780
Hello?

27
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:26,189
Trace the IP address back to the publisher of this article.

28
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:28,219
I need answers now.

29
00:01:28,219 --> 00:01:29,219
What?

30
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:33,500
The one who sent the photos into the article is Jim Kirby.

31
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,730
Jim?

32
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:38,450
It is Mistress.

33
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:43,140
Not again.

34
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:47,140
We miss Jim Kirby for questioning and clearly he's the one behind this smear campaign.

35
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,969
Wait, that's not necessary.

36
00:01:52,969 --> 00:01:54,969
I mean...

37
00:01:54,969 --> 00:01:57,969
Oh, I might have to involve the cops in this.

38
00:01:58,969 --> 00:02:02,959
It'll just draw more attention to the article.

39
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:09,409
But I can issue a statement saying that we were hacked and the article is fake.

40
00:02:09,409 --> 00:02:12,409
Fine, but make sure it's convincing.

41
00:02:12,409 --> 00:02:16,330
One more thing.

42
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:20,900
Why exactly were Lois and I trapped in that storage room?

43
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:29,659
I went in there to make a private phone call and she happens to walk in.

44
00:02:29,659 --> 00:02:32,659
But somehow the door locked behind her.

45
00:02:32,659 --> 00:02:40,389
Clearly, somebody here is more focused on sabotaging their co-workers rather than doing their actual job.

46
00:02:40,389 --> 00:02:53,460
Clearly, somebody here is more focused on sabotaging their co-workers rather than doing their actual job.

47
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:58,969
Perhaps it's time for newly shipped to step in and tackle these issues.

48
00:02:58,969 --> 00:03:00,969
But, Mr. Cavill, I swear.

49
00:03:00,969 --> 00:03:03,969
Honey, I strongly suggest you get your staff under control.

50
00:03:03,969 --> 00:03:09,080
This behavior will not fly under my room.

51
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:14,110
Understood.

52
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:21,349
That's all for now.

53
00:03:21,349 --> 00:03:22,580
Been waiting.

54
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:30,419
Long time.

55
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:32,460
He's up to something.

56
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:36,710
And whatever it is, it's gonna turn my life upside down.

57
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:45,110
Podcatonic, please. Make it strong.

58
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:46,110
I'm sorry, Ennis.

59
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:48,110
We're closed for a private event tonight.

60
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:54,310
Sorry, Sam.

61
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,310
Excuse me.

62
00:03:55,310 --> 00:04:10,599
So, thanks for the seat back there.

63
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:12,500
No problem.

64
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,500
So, uh, what's going on with you and that gym guy?

65
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,899
He cheated.

66
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:20,899
With my best friend.

67
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:22,899
We're divorced now.

68
00:04:22,899 --> 00:04:24,899
I'm staying with Barney.

69
00:04:24,899 --> 00:04:27,620
Just for now.

70
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:30,620
So, uh, go into another rich man to rework out.

71
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,779
Come as a bitch.

72
00:04:31,779 --> 00:04:32,910
That's not what happened.

73
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:35,910
But, I have some money I'm fucking out to.

74
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:40,500
I could be a new sugar daddy.

75
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,939
So, I could be a new sugar daddy.

76
00:04:44,939 --> 00:04:46,829
Go to hell, Clark.

77
00:04:46,829 --> 00:04:48,829
I'm not some gold digging bitch.

78
00:04:48,829 --> 00:04:49,829
Oh, really?

79
00:04:49,829 --> 00:04:52,829
Do you need me to remind you how our breakup went down?

80
00:04:52,829 --> 00:04:54,829
I remember every detail.

81
00:04:54,829 --> 00:04:55,829
You don't know the half of it.

82
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:56,829
Then tell me, Lois.

83
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:58,829
Why did you throw everything away from that prick?

84
00:04:58,829 --> 00:05:00,829
I can't tell him the truth.

85
00:05:00,829 --> 00:05:05,569
It destroyed him and ruined his relationship with Barney.

86
00:05:05,569 --> 00:05:06,569
That's what I thought.

87
00:05:06,569 --> 00:05:10,079
You're just left, just like that.

88
00:05:10,079 --> 00:06:33,459
You think that'd be a good idea?

89
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:34,620
You're everything between us.

90
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,480
I know.

91
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,480
I'm not asking for a serious relationship, okay?

92
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,480
Just something simpler.

93
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,860
No strings attached.

94
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,439
That's insane.

95
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:45,699
Lois, you owe me.

96
00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:47,699
After everything we've been through?

97
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:48,699
But I didn't.

98
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:50,699
His body's couch really that comfortable.

99
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:54,029
What about the paparazzi?

100
00:06:54,029 --> 00:06:56,029
Will they come sniffing around your place?

101
00:06:56,029 --> 00:06:58,129
I'm under it right here.

102
00:06:58,129 --> 00:07:01,129
I moved in for the exact reason no one knows who I am.

103
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:07,259
I moved in for the exact reason no one knows who I am.

104
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:09,319
What about the paparazzi?

105
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:11,319
I'm sniffing around your place.

106
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:12,319
I'm under it right here.

107
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,350
Okay?

108
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,350
I moved in for the exact reason.

109
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,350
No one knows who I am here.

110
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:18,279
Alright.

111
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:19,660
Look, I'll move in with you.

112
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,660
But only temporarily.

113
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,459
You know, if people found out about us,

114
00:07:24,459 --> 00:07:26,589
it could ruin your career.

115
00:07:26,589 --> 00:07:28,069
You know what?

116
00:07:28,069 --> 00:07:29,459
You're right.

117
00:07:29,459 --> 00:07:32,550
I'll just give up this whole celebrity thing now and...

118
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,550
I'm sure to call Barney in fact.

119
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:36,550
Sorry, stop.

120
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:37,550
Be serious.

121
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:40,550
I thought you wanted me to put our relationship ahead of my family.

122
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:42,839
That's not what I meant, and you know it.

123
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:45,060
Look, I just...

124
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:49,699
I don't want to be the reason you lose everything that you work so hard for.

125
00:07:49,699 --> 00:07:50,699
Get out.

126
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:55,939
I'm good at clown clicker maybe.

127
00:07:55,939 --> 00:07:57,939
I just have one more question.

128
00:07:57,939 --> 00:08:01,920
Just for fun.

129
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,920
I don't want to be the reason

130
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,920
you lose everything that you work so hard for.

131
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:09,069
You're good at clown clicker.

132
00:08:09,069 --> 00:08:13,670
I just have one more question.

133
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:15,410
Just for fun.

134
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:17,410
What if I did while he back?

135
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:18,410
I'm not in the mood for games.

136
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:20,410
I need an answer, Lois.

137
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:21,500
Fine.

138
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,300
All.

139
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,300
I'll take you back the day you went in Oscar.

140
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,300
Happy now.

141
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:32,659
Challenge accepted.

142
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:34,419
Let me drive you to work at least.

143
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:36,659
No, it's fine. I'll get anywhere.

144
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:58,379
Lus, what the hell are you doing here?

145
00:08:58,379 --> 00:09:01,259
None of your business get lost.

146
00:09:01,259 --> 00:09:02,840
I saw you leaving that guy's house.

147
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,059
What are you shocking out with some random guy now?

148
00:09:05,059 --> 00:09:07,299
I'm staying with a friend, you idiot.

149
00:09:07,299 --> 00:09:09,759
Remember, after you so kindly kicked me out?

150
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:11,600
Right. A friend.

151
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,860
Once a cheater, always a cheater, Lois.

152
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:17,399
You've got some nerve-consuming of cheating you lying suck of shit.

153
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:18,240
You know what?

154
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,279
You're just so desperate to find anyone

155
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:21,500
and fake life your performance.

156
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,440
Shut the fuck up, Lois.

157
00:09:24,340 --> 00:10:00,480
Sir, please step away.

158
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:12,970
Hey, why don't you become the idiot?

159
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:13,970
No, look what you made me do.

160
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:14,970
Me, you're the one who-

161
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:16,470
Fuck you, you guys, walk away.

162
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:30,580
Walk away.

163
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:40,659
So that's when you should get out of here, Lois.

164
00:10:40,659 --> 00:10:43,110
Hey, sin.

165
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:46,480
I really appreciate you having my backup.

166
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,490
No problem.

167
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:55,830
It's not like you left me for a loser or anything like that.

168
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:57,029
Really, Clark?

169
00:10:57,029 --> 00:10:59,029
You're gonna throw this in my face right now?

170
00:10:59,029 --> 00:11:00,429
Lois, I'm just saying.

171
00:11:00,429 --> 00:11:02,990
You made your choice, and this happened.

172
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:09,299
You know what, ever, please, I'm getting out.

173
00:11:09,299 --> 00:11:21,570
Mr. Kavil, why would you say something like that?

174
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:27,100
If it's obvious, you still love her.

175
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,610
Follow her.

176
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:30,409
Make sure she gets to the office safely.

177
00:11:30,409 --> 00:11:35,779
It's me.

178
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:37,179
I need you to look into Jim Kirby.

179
00:11:37,179 --> 00:11:48,620
I need to know contacts, movements, everything, no stone left on turn.

180
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:51,419
Look who finally decided to show up.

181
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:54,210
I've got a special assignment for you, Lois.

182
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:55,210
What is it this time?

183
00:11:55,210 --> 00:12:00,009
You're going to be interviewing that smoking hot new singer, Jase Hawthorne.

184
00:12:00,009 --> 00:12:02,409
Oh, and it's live.

185
00:12:02,409 --> 00:12:05,409
Well, look, I'm going to need some time to prepare.

186
00:12:05,409 --> 00:12:06,409
No time.

187
00:12:06,409 --> 00:12:07,409
Here's the list.

188
00:12:07,409 --> 00:12:09,409
Live in five.

189
00:12:09,409 --> 00:12:11,409
Don't screw this up.

190
00:12:11,409 --> 00:12:28,610
Morning, everyone.

191
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:32,610
I'm Lois Kane, and today we're joined by singing sensation, Jase Hawthorne.

192
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:34,830
It's great to be here.

193
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:35,830
Adjust the camera, Lois.

194
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:37,830
I need a better angle on Jase.

195
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:41,590
A little lower.

196
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:47,220
This is perfect, girl.

197
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:58,019
Stella, are you serious?

198
00:12:58,019 --> 00:12:59,019
I can't ask him these.

199
00:12:59,019 --> 00:13:00,019
They're so inappropriate.

200
00:13:00,019 --> 00:13:02,019
That's the list, Jase approved.

201
00:13:02,019 --> 00:13:07,019
So get the fuck on with it unless you want to get fired or blacklisted from every media outlet

202
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:09,080
in this city.

203
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:16,940
So, Jase, rumors are spreading that your last album tanked because you were sleeping around

204
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,940
and partying too much.

205
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:21,320
Care to comment?

206
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,509
What the hell did you just say?

207
00:13:23,509 --> 00:13:24,509
Why?

208
00:13:24,509 --> 00:13:29,029
You need to see us now.

209
00:13:29,029 --> 00:13:36,500
Did you know about this?

210
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:40,659
Was this your plan all along to humiliate me on live TV for ratings?

211
00:13:40,659 --> 00:13:41,659
No, I would say.

212
00:13:41,659 --> 00:13:46,629
Save it.

213
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:47,980
We all saw you messing with that camera.

214
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:54,460
This is slander.

215
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,710
Stella, please tell them it wasn't my idea.

216
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:57,710
Grab her.

217
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:59,710
We're not calling anyone until I get my answers.

218
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:01,710
Please, let me explain.

219
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:02,710
I stopped like that.

220
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:05,710
Mr. Cavill, I swear it was a mistake.

221
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:09,190
My assistant must have given her the wrong list.

222
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:10,639
You're fired.

223
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:11,639
You're fired.

224
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:12,639
I'm fired.

225
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:13,639
I'm fired.

226
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:14,639
I'm fired.

227
00:14:14,639 --> 00:15:36,570
I'm fired.

228
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:37,570
I'm fired.

229
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:38,570
I'm fired.

230
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:39,570
I'm fired.

231
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:40,570
I'm fired.

232
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:42,559
I'm fired.

233
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:43,559
You're fired.

234
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:45,559
Grab your things and go.

235
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:46,559
Please.

236
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:47,559
Sir, I can't lose this job.

237
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:48,559
My mom's in the hospital.

238
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:49,559
That's not my problem.

239
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:50,559
Get out.

240
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:51,559
Wait.

241
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:53,039
It wasn't her fault.

242
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:56,700
Just give her another chance.

243
00:15:56,700 --> 00:16:03,669
But if anything like this happens, get your both out.

244
00:16:03,669 --> 00:16:04,669
Understood?

245
00:16:04,669 --> 00:16:15,299
There you go.

246
00:16:15,299 --> 00:16:17,039
Thanks again.

247
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:18,490
Close.

248
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:20,740
You need to be more careful.

249
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,740
You're way too trusting.

250
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:22,740
I can get you into some trouble.

251
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:23,740
Really?

252
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,740
That's what you're going with right now?

253
00:16:25,740 --> 00:17:14,980
Look, I don't need another lecture.

254
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:15,980
Give us enough, everyone.

255
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,980
I've got an exciting opportunity to announce.

256
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:22,009
Mr. Clark Cavill will be filming a new documentary.

257
00:17:22,009 --> 00:17:25,009
And he needs one of our journalists to shadow him.

258
00:17:25,009 --> 00:17:26,009
Documenting every moment.

259
00:17:26,009 --> 00:17:32,170
The chosen journalist will live in Clark's house and work alongside him 24-7 until the

260
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:34,359
documentary is completed.

261
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:38,359
Afterward, they'll write an exclusive piece on the entire experience.

262
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:41,359
The close are key to you for the last chance you've been getting heard.

263
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:48,569
Afterward, they'll write an exclusive piece on the entire experience.

264
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:50,569
I'll do it, Mr. Cavill.

265
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:53,569
I'm the perfect choice for this project.

266
00:17:53,569 --> 00:17:57,049
Actually, I've already made my decision.

267
00:17:57,049 --> 00:17:58,779
Lois.

268
00:17:58,779 --> 00:18:00,779
I want you to be part of this project.

269
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:05,430
Mr. Cavill.

270
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:07,430
Lois's background is in finance.

271
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:10,430
I have far more experience.

272
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:12,430
My decision is final.

273
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:14,490
Stella.

274
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:16,349
Ms. Kane.

275
00:18:16,349 --> 00:18:17,349
What do you say?

276
00:18:17,349 --> 00:18:22,809
I know you're trying to protect me.

277
00:18:22,809 --> 00:18:24,809
Do you really think it's a good idea?

278
00:18:24,809 --> 00:18:25,809
Yeah, I do.

279
00:18:25,809 --> 00:18:29,380
So Lois, what's it going to be?

280
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:34,640
The more time we spend together, the closer Clark might get to the truth about why I broke up with him.

281
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,119
It could destroy his attention with Barney.

282
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:44,119
I appreciate the offer, Mr. Cavill, but I don't believe I'm the right fit for this project.

283
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:55,619
I appreciate the offer, Mr. Cavill, but I don't believe I'm the right fit for this project.

284
00:18:55,619 --> 00:18:59,059
Lois, if you don't take this opportunity,

285
00:18:59,059 --> 00:19:02,059
I will hand it to your competition on the silver platter.

286
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:08,059
Lois, if you pass up this opportunity, I will have no choice but to let you go.

287
00:19:08,059 --> 00:19:09,059
We don't.

288
00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:11,059
We cannot afford to lose this opportunity.

289
00:19:11,059 --> 00:19:22,619
First, the storage room incident, then last night.

290
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:25,619
There's definitely something going on between us two.

291
00:19:25,619 --> 00:19:30,119
Alright everyone, back to work.

292
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:32,470
Jim, it's me.

293
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:35,140
I need a favor.

294
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,140
Get your paparazzi buddies to keep it close.

295
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,400
I'm Clark Cavill.

296
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,400
I think there's a juicy story brewing.
