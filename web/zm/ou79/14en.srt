00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Close to the game and you're party like me

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,500
If you look up for the sauce, I got the recipe

3
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:15,890
How do you manage to snake an invite to this shindy ghost?

4
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:23,480
What did you, uh, mind yourself a sugar daddy?

5
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,780
Seriously, Jim, you're one to talk about shameless behavior.

6
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,170
What's that supposed to mean?

7
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:30,170
I don't know.

8
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:33,170
Maybe the fact that you couldn't keep it in your pants while we were married?

9
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:35,170
Did you cheat on your ex-wife?

10
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:36,170
No, not.

11
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:37,670
Mr. Kirby, is it true?

12
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:39,670
No, that's not what's going on.

13
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:42,240
Can you elaborate on these allegations?
