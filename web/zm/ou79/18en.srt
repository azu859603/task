00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:06,259
Mr. Kirby, do you have an issue of who I work with?

2
00:00:06,259 --> 00:00:13,660
Look, Mr. Gaville, I'm really sorry about the misunderstanding here, okay?

3
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:16,750
You know how it is with X's, things get heated.

4
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:17,750
Is that so?

5
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:20,879
But anyways, I want to talk with you about something.

6
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:23,879
My company, and your movie.

7
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:24,879
I want to work with you.

8
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:29,570
Yeah, that's not going to happen.

9
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:31,629
Oh, okay, what do you do?

10
00:00:31,629 --> 00:00:34,630
Listen to you very closely, I want to make something crystal clear for you.

11
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:37,789
I will never do business with your company.

12
00:00:37,789 --> 00:00:42,619
You got that, not now, and not ever.

13
00:00:42,619 --> 00:00:54,469
Oops, let's get you dressed.
