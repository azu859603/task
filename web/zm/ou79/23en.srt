1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,299
Hey Clark, hurry up, the show's about to start.

2
00:00:03,299 --> 00:00:05,299
I'm sorry, I got what you're doing.

3
00:00:05,299 --> 00:00:06,299
I'll be fine.

4
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:12,820
Good luck in there.

5
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:13,820
Good luck.

6
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,359
I might want to watch the show from here.

7
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:18,359
Yeah, that would be awesome.

8
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:27,579
Listen, Lewis, I need to get something off my chest.

9
00:00:27,579 --> 00:00:28,579
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:28,579 --> 00:00:31,440
For what I did back then?

11
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,439
Convincing you to break up with Clark?

12
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:35,439
Barney, we don't have to do this.

13
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:37,729
No, please, let me finish.

14
00:00:37,729 --> 00:00:39,729
I thought I was doing what was best for Clark's career.

15
00:00:39,729 --> 00:00:43,619
I never realized how much I was hurting both of you.

16
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:45,619
Yeah, but look at him now.

17
00:00:45,619 --> 00:00:47,619
He seemed to all work out in the end.

18
00:00:47,619 --> 00:00:55,929
Maybe career wise, but Lewis, I've never seen him as happy as he was with you.

19
00:00:55,929 --> 00:01:00,600
I know it's not my place, but you and Clark, you're meant to be together.
