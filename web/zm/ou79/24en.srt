1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,839
I know it's not my place, but you and Clark, you're meant to be together.

2
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:11,460
Yeah, but Barney, if he finds out the truth about our breakup, I mean, what will it

3
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:12,460
do to your friendship?

4
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,689
You're like a brother to him.

5
00:00:14,689 --> 00:00:17,399
And that's exactly why you should tell him.

6
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:22,980
He deserves the truth, and you both deserve to be happy.

7
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:30,199
There were so many nights, he'd get drunk and just call out your name over and over.

8
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:38,299
And during the toughest times in his career, he'd always say, I'm gonna make it big for her.

9
00:00:38,299 --> 00:00:43,359
For Lois, you were his motivation though, even when you weren't there.

10
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:46,990
Okay Barney, okay you're right.

11
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:52,659
Look after the ceremony, I'm gonna tell him, I'm gonna tell him, no more running, no more hiding.

12
00:00:52,659 --> 00:00:55,350
Thank you Lois, for fixing the mistake that I made.
