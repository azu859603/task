1
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:16,210
How long have you been seeing the movies came?

2
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:19,210
Is this why you turned down Jim Kirby's business office?

3
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:24,899
Because of your history with his ex-wife?

4
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:28,250
Okay, Lois and I fell in love in high school

5
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:30,629
and we stayed together through college.

6
00:00:30,629 --> 00:00:32,630
I was a struggling actor back then

7
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:36,630
and Lois worked two jobs to support me, to support my dream.

8
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:40,659
She believed in me, even when I didn't believe in myself.

9
00:00:40,659 --> 00:00:44,659
Lois is the love of my life.

10
00:00:44,659 --> 00:00:47,229
So, why did you break up?
