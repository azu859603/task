00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,820
So why did you break up Lois and I broke up due to misunderstanding. I thought that she left me for a wealthy man

2
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:09,820
But it turns out I was wrong

3
00:00:11,029 --> 00:00:16,149
My mistake was I didn't fight for her. I should have fought for her for us

4
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:20,309
He never believed I would choose money over him

5
00:00:21,339 --> 00:00:26,820
Lois if you're watching this, I love you. I never stopped. Will you take me back?

6
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:34,009
Well, if Lois agrees she should come up here and give Clark a big old kid

7
00:00:34,289 --> 00:00:36,289
Don't you?

8
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:40,920
What are you waiting for? Go get your man
