Stella, what the hell? Where is Jim? Where do you take Lois?

2
00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.220
I have no idea what you're talking about.

3
00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:16.899
Cut the crap Stella, I know you're Jim's little side key. Start talking!

4
00:00:19.489 --> 00:00:23.649
Oh please. How do you know she didn't run off with Jim willingly?

5
00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:31.250
Think about it Clark. Her ex-husband whisks her away. Sounds like they're after your cash if you ask me.

6
00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:43.490
Face it. She chose Jim over you. She doesn't love you. Stop lying to yourself.
