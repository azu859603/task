1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,539
She doesn't love you stop lying to yourself. I don't know us once. I love my pride in

2
00:00:13,539 --> 00:00:31,440
security is getting away. I lost her because of it. I will not let that happen again because

3
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:37,100
of it. I will not let that happen again. I'm choosing to believe in her. I will not let

4
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:41,100
you stand in the way or anything. Can you believe this guy Lois? He's actually doubling

5
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:48,600
down on this bullshit. Lois if you're watching this I love you. I always have and I always

6
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:59,909
will. I will find you. I love you too. Lois if you're watching this I love you. I always

7
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:05,819
have and I always will. I will find you. If I can't believe him I thought for sure he would

8
00:01:05,819 --> 00:01:10,379
think that you'd run off of him again. You're wrong about Clark and you're wrong about me.

9
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:15,859
I'll never leave Clark again. Well if I can't settle for destroying your very

10
00:01:15,859 --> 00:02:00,519
little ending with us. I guess I'll just have to settle for you and you. This is your last

11
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:08,389
chance. Where is Lois? If you don't tell me right now I swear I will never let you work

12
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:19,789
in this industry again. So I get it. You think you loved him but he's just using you just

13
00:02:19,789 --> 00:03:40,979
like he did with Lois. This one's our hotel. Room 237. Clark Lake to know. Lois. Lois. There's

14
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:45,460
something you need to know. Last night the doctors came and they ran some tests on you

15
00:03:45,460 --> 00:04:14,039
while you're unconscious and it turns out that I'm pregnant. After all these years I have

16
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:32,480
a question for you. Will you take me back for good? I hope I have one more question. Anything.

17
00:04:32,480 --> 00:05:06,470
Lois Kate. Of course. Please try to understand Barney was only doing what he thought was good

18
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:16,670
for your career. Okay he was he never meant to hurt us. I'm gonna need a best man. You

19
00:05:16,670 --> 00:06:03,100
man. Just like in Clarkerville has just been nominated for an Oscar. Sources close to

20
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:09,220
the bill have made shocking allegations. Although his rekindled romance was Lois

21
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:34,980
came. What the? Bond to the allegations that Miss Kate is only with you for your money. Those

22
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:47,750
allegations are completely false. If I mean I have to set the record straight. Years ago

23
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:54,189
when Clark was starting out I convinced Lois to break up with him. I thought I was doing

24
00:06:54,189 --> 00:07:01,699
what was best for Clark's career. So Lois pretended to fall for a rich man to make Clark

25
00:07:01,699 --> 00:07:13,500
let her go. But the truth is Lois did this out of love. She sacrificed her own happiness

26
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:21,300
for Clark's success. I've witnessed their love since high school. Please stop these hurtful

27
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:38,910
rumors. Let them be happy together. They deserve it. No way. No. Jim. Jim please. Let's talk

28
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:46,310
about this. Lois there's nothing to talk about. This man is just ruined everything. Look I hear

29
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:53,370
you. Jim this is not the way. Why don't we just discuss what you want. I want you to

30
00:07:53,370 --> 00:08:00,379
work with me in my next movie. Lois. Okay you want to work with me? Let's make it official.

31
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:29,720
I got a collage rack right here. If you sign it we got a deal. It goes to Clark

32
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:53,019
Cavill. So much true to receive such a astounding recognition today. This is truly an experience

33
00:08:53,019 --> 00:08:59,179
of a lifetime and it means a lot to me. Thank you. But none of this would have been possible

34
00:08:59,179 --> 00:09:05,700
without one thing and that is the unwavering support of someone very special to me. And

35
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:18,669
that person and that person is my wife Lois. Lois you happen, my rock, my inspiration,

36
00:09:18,669 --> 00:09:23,750
my everything. And on top of this I also have one more announcement to make tonight. And

37
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:32,539
that is that's as of today. I'll be officially retiring from acting and I've decided to move

38
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:37,980
into producing in order to spend more time with my loved ones, my family and overall focus

39
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:43,860
on the next chapter of my life. That also includes supporting my wife and her new career as a best

40
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:48,730
selling omelet. Thank you everyone again. Thank you.
