1
00:00:08,019 --> 00:00:13,140
Will you stay right down the stairs here?

2
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:16,899
No, I wouldn't be here any more if I was here...

3
00:00:16,899 --> 00:00:26,780
I was here every day...

4
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:30,719
I love you, your mother and daughter.

5
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:33,320
I'm not going to be there for you.

6
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,320
Okay, I'm here to hang out.

7
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,500
You just want to stay alone.

8
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,299
I'm so sorry.

9
00:00:40,299 --> 00:00:43,939
I'm happy to be back there for you.

10
00:00:43,939 --> 00:00:44,979
Why...

11
00:00:44,979 --> 00:00:51,820
Who's the girl in the car?

12
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,500
bad, there's no way to trust me.

13
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:02,920
I've never seen the driver leave me here!

14
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,480
I've never seen the driver leave.

15
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:09,760
We'd need to be able to stay in my car for too long.

16
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:13,560
Or I will never even give up.

17
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:19,519
It's what I've learned that day.

18
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:20,079
Wait...

19
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:22,079
I'll show you how you may stay.

20
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:25,760
I haven't seen the driver leave.

21
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,319
I don't want to talk to you again and for yourself.

22
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:29,819
I just want to ask you.

23
00:01:29,819 --> 00:01:31,400
It'sbook.

24
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:35,670
Y'all, I know that you had paid my money.

25
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:42,890
I know that I have a lot of requests to provide my money.

26
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:46,079
It's been awesome!
