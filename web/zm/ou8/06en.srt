1
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:02,830
So what?

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:04,349
What is this?

3
00:00:04,929 --> 00:00:05,429
What?

4
00:00:05,429 --> 00:00:07,250
Is it this way or this way?

5
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:08,619
What?

6
00:00:08,619 --> 00:00:09,720
What do you think about it?

7
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,619
I don't know.

8
00:00:10,619 --> 00:00:11,560
I'm not gonna die.

9
00:00:12,669 --> 00:00:14,630
I'm just gonna die.

10
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:18,379
What?

11
00:00:21,089 --> 00:00:22,410
I don't know.

12
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:23,809
I'm not gonna be okay.

13
00:00:23,809 --> 00:00:25,309
I'm not gonna die.

14
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:27,489
I was just going to die.

15
00:00:27,489 --> 00:00:29,449
I'm not gonna die.

16
00:00:29,769 --> 00:00:31,609
I don't know.

17
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,579
I'm not gonna die.

18
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:45,159
me, but I will never be a Emperor and I will never be a disciple.

19
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:50,060
And as I signed this meeting, I actually was my son.

20
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,420
I was a kid and I played with him.

21
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:56,579
I was in the sameille for days, I was a little drunk.

22
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:59,619
And he couldn't possibly go from there, he still wasn't.

23
00:00:59,619 --> 00:01:01,619
Yeah, no, I didn't feel it.

24
00:01:01,619 --> 00:01:03,539
I thought I had to sleep any time.

25
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:04,950
And then I didn't feel it.

26
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:07,590
You don't know what's going on here?

27
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:10,030
No, no, it's already stopped for 20 minutes...

28
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:12,019
But now you're not there yet?

29
00:01:12,019 --> 00:01:13,819
And I'll leave you in the comments...

30
00:01:13,819 --> 00:01:16,780
What's going on here?

31
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:21,099
Sorry, your friend.

32
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,959
You've heard me about her.

33
00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:36,230
No matter what you're in your life.

34
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,120
I have to believe that you will always stay at the table at night.
