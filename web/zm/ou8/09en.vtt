00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.019
Today is a terrible trip

2
00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.660
Why are you here?

3
00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:12.820
This is the first time

4
00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:14.380
I'm happy

5
00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.140
I'm so happy

6
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:17.660
I'm so happy

7
00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:18.940
No

8
00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:20.579
No

9
00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:21.899
Why are you here?

10
00:00:21.899 --> 00:00:24.350
I'm alone

11
00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:27.370
I'm sorry

12
00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:29.530
You're ashamed, I'm not alone

13
00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.170
I need to find the melody

14
00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.579
Why are you for this trip?

15
00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:41.799
Ok

16
00:00:41.799 --> 00:01:07.750
What do you mean?

17
00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.060
I was born in a state of age

18
00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.939
and I was born in a city in a city that was not considered to be a society.

19
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.010
Same history,

20
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.209
I was born in a city that was not a city.

21
00:01:28.129 --> 00:01:29.299
But now,

22
00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:31.569
my life is not the only way I can.

23
00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:33.209
I live in a city that is not a city.
