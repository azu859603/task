Why are you being frightened of my hesitation that I've been with you all?

24
00:01:30.099 --> 00:01:31.099
I did all that manage.

Oh, you caught me?

26
00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:33.099
I have the thought.

00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:34.099
Your though just disappeared, even the circumstances that have happened.

I'm sorry to say that I'm not a prope

126
00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:24.889
It's a tough day to watch, but I'm sure you will be surprised today.

127
00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:26.429
What if you were not left?

128
00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:32.980
I'm still interested in watching this, so I'm not interested in watching this.

129
00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:36.840
You're the only person in this place.

130
00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:41.590
It's not like I was the only person I'm here to do.

131
00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:44.620
I can't, I can't, I can't.

132
00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:47.980
What if you look at this girl's face like this?

133
00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:49.559
Say something to me.

134
00:09:57.620 --> 00:09:59.059
Why are you still here?

135
00:10:03.519 --> 00:10:06.519
I'm not interested in watching this or not.

136
00:10:06.519 --> 00:10:07.899
There are no people in the world.

137
00:10:07.899 --> 00:10:09.899
Tell me what is already in the video

138
00:10:09.899 --> 00:10:11.899
I hope you enjoy now

139
00:10:11.899 --> 00:10:12.990

I will get you

141
00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:23.990
The only thing that is in the video

142
00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:26.679
Is the mood is like

143
00:10:26.679 --> 00:10:28.679
just annoying my dad

144
00:10:28.679 --> 00:10:31.500
I have no idea

145
00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:33.500
I feel like I'm in battle

146
00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:39.340
Oh, I'm in battle

147
00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:41.340
But he didn't think I was in battle

148
00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:42.340
Excuse me?

149
00:10:42.340 --> 00:11:10.009
Okay.

150
00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:17.190
No, no, no, no.

151
00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:19.679
I am the final reporter.

152
00:11:19.679 --> 00:11:22.480
No, no, no, no.

153
00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:23.480
I have no idea.

154
00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:24.480
No, no, no.

155
00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:27.960
There is something I can do here.

156
00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:32.799
I couldn't see the mic.

157
00:11:32.799 --> 00:11:33.840
What?

158
00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:39.419
You are just trying to see you?

159
00:11:39.419 --> 00:11:42.379
It's like a government-made or a government-made.

160
00:11:42.379 --> 00:11:43.379
You have no idea.

161
00:11:43.379 --> 00:11:44.419
All this.

162
00:11:44.419 --> 00:12:11.799
You have no idea.

163
00:12:11.799 --> 00:12:12.799
Adios.

164
00:14:18.309 --> 00:14:20.919
Let's go!

165
00:15:00.759 --> 00:15:39.529
Or maybe...

166
00:15:39.529 --> 00:16:10.230
to know that here is the true story.

167
00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:15.600
Hello!

168
00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:16.919
Hey!

169
00:16:16.919 --> 00:16:22.049
This scene has been shot in the first time...

170
00:16:22.049 --> 00:16:24.049
I can't see...

171
00:16:24.049 --> 00:16:25.049
It's so great.

172
00:16:25.049 --> 00:16:26.049
I can't believe it's going to be her.

173
00:16:26.049 --> 00:16:33.990
But the coming time might come again but even more.

174
00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:39.190
The most notable thing is,

175
00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:40.149
who is the most beautiful?

176
00:16:40.149 --> 00:16:42.309
It is the most beautiful.

177
00:16:42.309 --> 00:17:08.930
But there has to be a lot of options.

178
00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:11.190
And it takes a lot of time to go back.

179
00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:18.099
But it is better to have like this.

180
00:17:18.099 --> 00:17:20.299
Pause for a while.

181
00:17:20.299 --> 00:17:23.380
Here is something else

182
00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:25.849
Because I'm a little more like that.

183
00:17:25.849 --> 00:17:31.450
What do you like?

184
00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:32.450
I like this one.

185
00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:37.059
Her name is Trabale.

186
00:17:37.059 --> 00:17:39.180
Trabale?

187
00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:40.480
Sing.

188
00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:42.809
STARGiant, El Hevo.

189
00:17:42.809 --> 00:17:44.789
I can be a part of this part of the part,

190
00:17:44.789 --> 00:17:47.759
with this man I think.

191
00:17:47.759 --> 00:17:54.490
Pop's the difference has to be completely synchronized.

192
00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:57.119
For the first time,

193
00:17:57.119 --> 00:17:59.819
she has to be at the center of the house.

194
00:17:59.819 --> 00:18:03.529
She has to be at the center of the house,

195
00:18:03.529 --> 00:18:09.119
but she's not coming to the center.

196
00:18:09.119 --> 00:18:10.490
Who do you think is at the center?

197
00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:15.099
You think you are at the center of the center?

198
00:18:15.099 --> 00:18:19.160
In that, we left again, we were stuck with ourselves.

199
00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:22.380
I liked the art studio.

200
00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:24.779
No! That's not the case.

201
00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:27.559
I don't have to say that.

202
00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:32.789
Bella, the view of the white dress that is like a very small dress.

203
00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:37.609
Her father is the agent of the Parisian car.

204
00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:45.420
My father is the same as my father.

205
00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:48.980
It's not me.

206
00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:59.190
I'm a small girl.

207
00:18:59.190 --> 00:19:03.200
You're my ally.

208
00:19:03.559 --> 00:19:05.180
Of course, we've met you,

209
00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:23.799
I think it's the greatest conversation I have ever seen in my life.

210
00:19:23.799 --> 00:19:25.799
It's not my life.

211
00:19:25.799 --> 00:19:27.410
It's too difficult to understand.

212
00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:29.349
Everything is like bad things,

213
00:19:29.349 --> 00:19:32.150
everything must be like bad things.

214
00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:35.549
I don't know where to go.

215
00:19:35.549 --> 00:19:37.309
I don't know where to go.

216
00:19:39.369 --> 00:19:42.099
But I don't know anything about my life.

217
00:19:42.099 --> 00:19:43.880
It's because I look at my life as well.

218
00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:45.640
I don't know where to go.

219
00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:46.500
No.

220
00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:49.640
It's not that quick.

221
00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:54.900
No, it's good.

222
00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:55.900
What?

223
00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:59.099
No, no. He was making the bookworms.

224
00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:02.880
All right. So, happy.

225
00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:06.279
I'm not going to be making this book.

226
00:20:06.279 --> 00:20:10.180
Yes, I've got to be making this book.

227
00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:12.700
Oh, no, I'm not going to be making it.

228
00:20:13.539 --> 00:20:14.740
Mm-hm.

229
00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:17.839
I'm going to be making this bookworms.

230
00:20:17.839 --> 00:20:27.680
Yes, I'm not making this book ever.

231
00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:32.470
You can use this book.

232
00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:35.750
The video is coming up on the phone.

233
00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:46.009
It's the same.

234
00:20:46.009 --> 00:20:48.539
It's the same thing.

235
00:20:48.539 --> 00:20:50.380
It's the same.

236
00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:52.099
I'm a little bit sleepy.

237
00:20:52.099 --> 00:20:54.420
It's the same thing.

238
00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:56.180
Good.

239
00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:59.599
No, sorry.

240
00:20:59.599 --> 00:21:01.180
No, sorry.

241
00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:03.859
Well, I still have to be friends.

242
00:21:03.859 --> 00:21:05.039
No, no, no, no.

243
00:21:05.039 --> 00:21:06.400
You have to be friends.

244
00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:09.579
Nobody has to be friends,

245
00:21:09.579 --> 00:21:12.140
Also, you have to be friends.

246
00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:14.680
I think we should be friends.

247
00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:29.369
It's over.

248
00:21:29.369 --> 00:21:30.490
Oh, look!

249
00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:35.819
Come here and meet.

250
00:21:35.819 --> 00:21:44.210
You're Brick narrower.

251
00:21:44.210 --> 00:22:04.980
Look a little bigger.

252
00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:17.910
Look, don't have any help from me.

253
00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:24.950
I don't think I could hurt it.

254
00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:26.289
Perhaps, Rosenthal.

255
00:22:26.289 --> 00:22:29.589
But when he did that thing?

256
00:22:29.589 --> 00:22:30.950
There were two cupboards!

257
00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:32.970
When Jones was told,

258
00:22:32.970 --> 00:22:34.970
Hello. It's your friend

259
00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:37.220
Who's giving the words?

260
00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:39.259
Are you serious?!

261
00:22:39.259 --> 00:22:42.980
How many years old are you?

262
00:22:55.920 --> 00:23:00.779
I've already seen something that is...

263
00:23:00.779 --> 00:23:04.839
A lot of children.

264
00:23:04.839 --> 00:23:09.420
In my case, I worked very good with you.

265
00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:21.990
Then I came to you and I asked you why?

266
00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:26.339
I was seen by you

267
00:23:26.339 --> 00:23:29.609
It's so cold and cold...

268
00:23:31.269 --> 00:23:32.009
I'm so cold...

269
00:23:32.009 --> 00:23:36.740
You're not afraid of this is the case,

270
00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:38.380
I'm just a feeling.

271
00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:39.319
I'm scared.

272
00:23:39.319 --> 00:23:40.579
My fault is...

273
00:23:40.579 --> 00:23:42.220
My heart is just...

274
00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:43.660
My heart is broken.

275
00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:45.299
My right is not a shame.

276
00:23:45.299 --> 00:23:48.109
The whole thing, can't tell.

277
00:23:48.109 --> 00:23:51.460
I'll go out...

278
00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:54.470
What?

279
00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:56.230
How...

280
00:23:56.230 --> 00:24:26.109
I'm afraid, I couldn't wait until you leave.

281
00:24:26.109 --> 00:24:33.329
How do you get the wrong words?

282
00:24:33.329 --> 00:24:38.150
Hey guys, in the next video, I will give you a few details on this video,

283
00:24:38.150 --> 00:24:42.890
and I will take you to the next video.

284
00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:46.009
I will tell you how to do this.

285
00:24:46.009 --> 00:24:46.690
See you.

286
00:24:46.690 --> 00:24:47.910
See you.

287
00:24:47.910 --> 00:24:52.509
See you tomorrow.

288
00:24:52.509 --> 00:24:54.720
Bye!

289
00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:56.400
It's time for a new video.

290
00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:59.279
It's time for me to finish the video,

291
00:24:59.279 --> 00:25:01.160
and you will see a new video.

292
00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:03.079
I hope you will have a good day.

293
00:25:03.079 --> 00:25:07.859
Take care of yourself.

294
00:25:07.859 --> 00:25:09.839
I hope you will have a good day.

295
00:25:09.839 --> 00:25:20.009
Just a moment.

296
00:25:20.009 --> 00:25:23.529
I know that you may be a bit scared but you wouldn't be happy.

297
00:25:23.529 --> 00:25:26.430
I speak about it a bit because of this.

298
00:25:26.799 --> 00:25:28.680
You can't be a little worried.

299
00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:30.480
What are we going to do?

300
00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:33.029
I've never heard you.

301
00:25:33.150 --> 00:25:35.369
This is the best thing.

302
00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:39.960
You get into my secure room.

303
00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:40.960
You want to listen to me?

304
00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:41.960
No.

305
00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:42.960
I know.

306
00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:44.160
But you're not 1960.

307
00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:46.880
I don't want to talk to you.

308
00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:49.700
I'll say the same thing.

309
00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:50.819
So I'll be here.

310
00:25:50.819 --> 00:25:58.930
I'll be here and start.

311
00:25:58.930 --> 00:26:00.930
See you next time!
