1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.459
The metric.

2
00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:05.000
The metric.

3
00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.599
Ballaria?

4
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:06.440
The metric.

5
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:07.440
The metric.

6
00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:08.140
Ballaria.

7
00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:12.429
Ballaria.

8
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.769
Hey, hey, oh, I caught her.

9
00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:26.120
I'm the person, I'm the original.

10
00:00:26.219 --> 00:00:28.460
Just to do, Ben, from this controller is set.

11
00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:29.679
To do, Ben.

12
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.579
Hey, hey, hey, no.

13
00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:32.500
Saying how it,

14
00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.759
this one I should recognize in the video.

15
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.259
Oh, it's the impact,

16
00:00:36.299 --> 00:00:37.520
I wanted to see it in the end.

17
00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:40.130
And I thought how it was about your own.

18
00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.549
It's a very important thing, it's a wonderful thing.

19
00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:43.729
It doesn't happen.

20
00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:45.789
I always thought it was a car.

21
00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:47.390
I've never been a car.

22
00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:48.590
But I've never done anything,

23
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.590
so I thought I'd be able to get married again.

24
00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.390
All the good ideas throughout.

25
00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:53.789
I've never seen the same things.

26
00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.770
On that side, you're not even looking at me.

27
00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:56.789
No care.

28
00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:11.400
You're just so bad.

29
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.079
I will never be to hell with you.
