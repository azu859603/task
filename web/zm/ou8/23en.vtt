00:00:02.529 --> 00:00:03.529
I don't know!

3
00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:05.450
I think, maybe, I can do it, now!

4
00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:06.969
I'm gonna have to do something.

5
00:00:06.969 --> 00:00:08.169
I need to hold it.

6
00:00:08.169 --> 00:00:09.730
It's okay, I think.

7
00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:10.769
I think it's okay.

8
00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:11.929
I'm not gonna.

9
00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:15.519
Do you know that I'm gonna...

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:16.420
No!

11
00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:17.589

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:26.780
Do not move, do you know that I'm going to do that?

13
00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:27.579
What?

14
00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:28.480
No!

15
00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:29.460
Does anyone have any magic?

16
00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:40.000
Do you have magic?

17
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.159
Do you wanna go and see me?

18
00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:42.159
That's what's going on there.

19
00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:44.100
I'll put you in your pocket and go out there.

20
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.939
No?

21
00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:46.740
I think I'm gonna have to do it.

22
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:54.750
I'm good to see you!

23
00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:56.070
You have to be well understood,

24
00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.170
and you will see the other,

25
00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.939
and you will see the other!

26
00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:03.450
And they will be all of you here!

27
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.180
Where you live?

28
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.900

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.000
I am gonna live here!

37
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.299
And now I live very well!

38
00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:26.739
And now I live!

39
00:01:26.739 --> 00:01:32.819
Yes, I mean, I want to put it the same way.

40
00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:34.980
The whole thing goes on.

41
00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.959
You're like a little superhero, did you?

42
00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:40.959
No, no, I could never get that!

43
00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:41.959
No, I couldn't do it.

44
00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:44.569
No, no, I couldn't do anything...

45
00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:49.569
no, the man will put me down there that you're looking for today.

46
00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:52.569
Yes, I didn't do anything to him.

47
00:01:52.569 --> 00:02:00.680
I, as a Doctor, I'd have to plan to do something with you soon.

48
00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.680
Oh...

49
00:06:47.660 --> 00:07:06.300

51
00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.759
You're gonna be pretty good.

52
00:07:12.019 --> 00:07:13.500
I don't know what to tell you.

53
00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.459
I don't know what to tell you.

54
00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.529
But what if I don't tell you?

55
00:07:20.629 --> 00:07:22.490
Maybe I know who to say,

56
00:07:23.069 --> 00:07:25.269
I don't know what to tell you.

57
00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:33.110
I don't know, but I don't know.

58
00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:35.410
I don't know if I'm gonna do it.

59
00:07:35.889 --> 00:07:36.490
Wow,

60
00:07:37.329 --> 00:07:39.689
I'm gonna go back to the house.

61
00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:40.990
What would you like to tell me?

62
00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:44.370

00:08:18.819 --> 00:08:22.379
idk.

65
00:08:22.379 --> 00:08:28.480
When he was a good friend,

66
00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:32.759
and now he will be my imager.

67
00:08:32.759 --> 00:08:33.759
hewelles.

68
00:08:33.759 --> 00:08:38.750
he is the only friend I told with his postures.

69
00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:41.350
If he does, he is the best friend.

70
00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:43.269
he is going to be the best.

71
00:08:43.269 --> 00:08:45.269
he was a good friend.

72
00:08:45.269 --> 00:08:47.269

Huh?

76
00:09:36.019 --> 00:09:43.019
I know your body is not complete, its a problem, I am a bit nervous.

77
00:09:43.019 --> 00:09:44.720
Who can you tell me what is going on?

78
00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:47.440
What?

79
00:09:48.639 --> 00:09:49.639
Is it not me?

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:51.740
I am a very tall adult.

81
00:09:55.269 --> 00:09:57.289
But am I a very tall adult?

82
00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:04.820
How much is my body?

83
00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:10.419
What's your problem with you?

84
00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:17.730
How much are you in the night?

85
00:10:22.379 --> 00:10:25.360
How long are you?

86
00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:27.440
It's only the same.

87
00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:30.409
I don't want to ask you.

88
00:10:30.409 --> 00:10:32.789
I'm a granny.

89
00:10:32.789 --> 00:10:37.860
No.

90
00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:43.240
I don't care if it's your career.

91
00:10:43.240 --> 00:11:05.879
I have to say something else.

92
00:11:05.879 --> 00:11:08.840
I will never think of this as a passion.

93
00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:10.399
I love this!

94
00:11:10.399 --> 00:11:12.399

Okay.

00:12:31.519 --> 00:12:33.529
We can do this, not that.

121
00:12:33.529 --> 00:12:40.629
No way.

You're like my brain!!

When I am eating egg..

You have to eat eggs!!

You are not really a man.

174
00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:23.720
You are always a guy.

175
00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:24.720
Leave me alone.

176
00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:26.740

00:15:31.779 --> 00:15:34.830
I can't believe it.

179
00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:37.820
I am not a man.

180
00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:38.820
You are a bitch.

181
00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:41.210
I am a woman who is a woman.

182
00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:43.429
I am an old woman.

183
00:15:43.429 --> 00:15:45.429
I was a man.

00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:53.610
I am a woman.

188

It'sparodem phrases reported as peaceful,

189
00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:06.279
and they are debating they don't serve you.

190
00:16:06.639 --> 00:16:10.269
Here is what I'm talking about!

191
00:16:10.269 --> 00:16:12.250
What's happened?

192
00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:15.629
All this?

193
00:16:15.629 --> 00:17:09.359
All this and all this?

194
00:17:09.359 --> 00:17:11.980
varying

195
00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:12.740
all this.

196
00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:14.859
I'm your mother!

197
00:17:15.099 --> 00:17:16.099
where are you?

198
00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:24.839
4iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii more scrape!

199
00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:36.920
ka-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba

200
00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:39.099
Hoa, bleu kakizameh

201
00:17:39.099 --> 00:17:40.799
no, mokakizameha

202
00:17:40.799 --> 00:17:42.119
I'm a nook-É-ba-mo-dik

203
00:17:42.119 --> 00:17:43.539
it's no kafizameha-speaking

204
00:17:43.539 --> 00:17:50.029
ok,

205
00:17:50.029 --> 00:17:53.509
what's the new one named by Shukor?

206
00:17:53.509 --> 00:17:54.410
no

207
00:17:54.410 --> 00:17:56.140
zE

208
00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:59.619
what is the new answer to that word?

209
00:17:59.619 --> 00:18:00.680
No, I'm a good one

210
00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:01.799
no, I know

211
00:18:01.799 --> 00:18:03.839
this is the new one, we ask for a car

212
00:18:03.839 --> 00:18:07.140
That's why I mean this.

213
00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:10.920
And I told you that I was a little bit nervous.

214
00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:15.140
Now it's not going to be too big.

215
00:18:15.609 --> 00:18:19.119
I want to be a bit of throat.

216
00:18:19.519 --> 00:18:28.920
But I didn't want to do a bye.

217
00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:31.680
I want to do a bye.

218
00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:33.519
The only one who decides to do a dance!

219
00:18:38.109 --> 00:18:39.829
Then you can't stop me.

220
00:18:39.829 --> 00:18:40.970
I want to do a dance.

221
00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:43.069
I need to take a short break.

222
00:18:43.069 --> 00:18:45.569
He's also known as Mio Deja.

223
00:18:45.569 --> 00:18:47.109
Now the guy's...

224
00:18:47.109 --> 00:18:49.059
...that's the big side,

225
00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:52.819
but he's always known for you.

226
00:18:53.079 --> 00:18:55.720
The guy's always known for you.

227
00:18:56.099 --> 00:18:59.470
We'll be the winner.

228
00:18:59.769 --> 00:19:02.849
When he comes to the store...

229
00:19:03.529 --> 00:19:17.079
...you'll have to say that in the day.

230
00:19:17.619 --> 00:19:19.339
The band is in the garage.

231
00:19:19.910 --> 00:19:22.230
The director has to tell you.

232
00:19:22.329 --> 00:19:23.450
He's an amazing girl.

233
00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:25.309
And he's always known for you.

234
00:19:25.309 --> 00:19:29.710
I'm not going to be so busy with my friends.

235
00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:31.230
And I'm going to be doing this for you.

236
00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:33.480
Oh, my God, I'm not going to.

237
00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:38.059
I'm going to have a trip.

238
00:19:38.599 --> 00:19:41.380
Ah, I'm going to be an idiot!

239
00:19:42.309 --> 00:19:44.950
It's really so important that I'm not going to be an idiot.

240
00:19:45.069 --> 00:19:49.279
I'm going to be an idiot, but I'm going to be an idiot.

241
00:19:49.279 --> 00:19:50.509
I'm going to be a idiot.

242
00:19:50.509 --> 00:19:53.640
No, I'm going to be an idiot.

243
00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:55.799
I'm going to be a idiot.

244
00:19:55.799 --> 00:19:57.529
No, that's right.

245
00:19:57.529 --> 00:20:01.140
I can't believe I won't be a human.

246
00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:08.920
I got a special offer.

247
00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:16.519
I won't be a human.

248
00:20:16.519 --> 00:20:18.519
And I won't be a human.

249
00:20:18.519 --> 00:20:21.900
My soul is ready to die.

250
00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:26.279
I am not going to be a human.

251
00:20:26.279 --> 00:20:37.720
I'm not going to be a human.

252
00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:48.009
But I'm going to be a human.

253
00:20:48.009 --> 00:20:49.309
ode.

254
00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:50.910
Got him.

255
00:20:51.569 --> 00:20:56.640
And it's all good.

256
00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.759
But it's not bad.

257
00:20:59.859 --> 00:21:00.599
I'm sorry.

258
00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:02.259
I'm sorry.

259
00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:03.690
I'm sorry.

260
00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:05.269
My name is...

261
00:21:05.549 --> 00:21:06.450
Get down.

262
00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:07.349
and I'm sorry.

263
00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:12.730
Go now?

264
00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:14.970
Go now.

265
00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:16.950
I'll get you a move.

266
00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:18.109
No.

267
00:21:18.349 --> 00:21:20.769
I'm no good at going.

268
00:21:22.759 --> 00:21:24.720
It's almost too much.

269
00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:28.339
One day I've got to go up.

270
00:21:28.539 --> 00:21:29.759
Yes.

271
00:21:29.759 --> 00:21:30.759
In English.

272
00:21:30.759 --> 00:21:33.740
Okay.

273
00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:39.700
That's it.

274
00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:40.769
What the fuck?

275
00:21:40.769 --> 00:21:50.980
Me?

276
00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:51.980
Me?

277
00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:53.369
Me?

278
00:21:53.369 --> 00:21:54.369
Me?

279
00:21:54.369 --> 00:21:55.369
Me?

280
00:21:55.369 --> 00:21:56.500
Me?

281
00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:57.500
Me?

282
00:21:57.500 --> 00:21:58.750
Me?

283
00:21:58.750 --> 00:21:59.750
Me?

284
00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:03.599
Me?

285
00:22:03.599 --> 00:22:04.599
Me?

286
00:22:04.599 --> 00:22:05.599
Me?

287
00:22:05.599 --> 00:22:06.599
Me?

288
00:22:06.599 --> 00:22:09.619
Me?

289
00:22:09.619 --> 00:22:10.619
Me?

290
00:22:10.619 --> 00:22:11.619
Me?

291
00:22:11.619 --> 00:22:12.619
Me?

292
00:22:12.619 --> 00:22:15.059
Me?

293
00:22:15.059 --> 00:22:16.059
Me?

294
00:22:16.059 --> 00:22:17.059
Me?

295
00:22:17.059 --> 00:22:18.059
Me?

296
00:22:18.059 --> 00:22:19.150
Me?

297
00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:20.150
Me?

298
00:22:21.309 --> 00:22:23.309
By his example, crimes.

299
00:22:23.309 --> 00:22:24.309
Me?

300
00:22:24.309 --> 00:22:25.410
Me?

301
00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:26.410
Me?

302
00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:29.630
Me?

303
00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:30.630
Me?

304
00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:31.630
Me?

305
00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:33.109
Me?

306
00:22:33.109 --> 00:22:34.869
Me?

307
00:22:34.869 --> 00:22:35.869
Me?

308
00:22:35.869 --> 00:22:39.609
Me?

309
00:22:39.609 --> 00:22:40.170
Me?

310
00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:41.569
Say that you thought that Bubble Day would be the problem.

311
00:22:41.569 --> 00:22:42.569
Me?

312
00:22:42.569 --> 00:22:45.569
Where did the girl leave her and tell me that she broke him?

313
00:22:45.569 --> 00:22:46.789
Me?

314
00:22:46.789 --> 00:22:47.710
Me?

315
00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:50.640
Me?

316
00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:50.900
Me?

317
00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:54.849
Who's which?

318
00:22:54.849 --> 00:22:56.200
Me.

319
00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:57.839
Sure.

320
00:22:57.839 --> 00:22:59.869
Man, a sweetheart voice.

321
00:22:59.869 --> 00:23:00.369
Oh!

322
00:23:00.849 --> 00:23:28.630
Really?

323
00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:28.890
Oh!

324
00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:30.130
What am I doing?

325
00:23:30.130 --> 00:23:31.130
No, don't cry.

326
00:23:31.130 --> 00:23:32.569
I have to tell you something.

327
00:23:33.650 --> 00:23:35.549
I just didn't say it.

328
00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:39.759
You were trying to go to the meeting 51 years ago.

329
00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:45.000
I could go to the meeting at the meeting.

330
00:23:57.500 --> 00:23:58.779
I'm going to be there.

331
00:23:59.099 --> 00:24:04.460
I'm going to be there.

332
00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:05.920
I'm going to be there!

333
00:24:07.559 --> 00:24:08.480
I'm going to be there.

334
00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:36.609
You're going to be there.

335
00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:38.170
I should be there.

336
00:24:39.039 --> 00:24:41.140
But I don't think that I'll wait until my day.

337
00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:41.940
No, I'm going to stay there.

338
00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:43.690
Nothing.

339
00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:45.490
You should be there.

340
00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:47.019
And I should be there.

341
00:24:47.079 --> 00:24:49.079
Are you right?

342
00:24:49.079 --> 00:24:52.079
I'm coming to life, and I'll just be there.

343
00:24:52.079 --> 00:24:55.079
There's nothing wrong with something beyond that.

344
00:24:55.079 --> 00:24:57.140
It was so good.

345
00:24:57.140 --> 00:24:59.140
And it's so good.

346
00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:00.140
There's nothing wrong.

347
00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:11.279
What is this?

348
00:25:11.279 --> 00:25:12.279
We're ready for you.

349
00:25:12.279 --> 00:25:17.640
We are here.

350
00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:19.930
Pele.

351
00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:20.930
Huh?

352
00:25:20.930 --> 00:25:21.930
Humber.

353
00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:23.990
It's okay.

354
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:25.690
You were coming.

355
00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:26.690
How long you put this?

356
00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:30.980
I thought it was going to be different, but I think we are there.

357
00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:40.369
But what is it?

358
00:25:40.369 --> 00:25:57.579
Hope you guys enjoy this, and we will talk about this in a minute.

359
00:25:57.579 --> 00:26:04.519
This is the part of the search, and this is the point of the search.

360
00:26:04.519 --> 00:26:07.230
Hey....

361
00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:09.859
Bella.

362
00:26:09.859 --> 00:26:11.119
characteristic.

363
00:26:11.119 --> 00:26:13.220
I thought that you would do this to me.

364
00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:16.359
So don't tell me what you are hearing in the past...

365
00:26:16.359 --> 00:26:22.400
No matter where you live.

366
00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:23.000
I know..

367
00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.440
since I was 13 years old.

368
00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:29.089
I was just a little young and 2 years old.

369
00:26:29.089 --> 00:26:30.819
I didn't talk so well.

370
00:26:30.819 --> 00:26:33.220
You have told me about my own words.

371
00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:39.049
I am too tired. As soon as we meet our friends in the Conn-TÅ Channel, I have the best friends.

372
00:26:39.589 --> 00:26:41.069
What are you doing?

373
00:26:41.309 --> 00:26:42.329
I don't wanna stay here?

374
00:26:42.529 --> 00:26:45.180
No. No.

375
00:26:45.539 --> 00:26:47.700
As soon as the season ends,

376
00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:49.640
I want to stay home.

377
00:26:54.029 --> 00:26:58.390
I am so glad that my friends are not growing up.

378
00:26:59.569 --> 00:27:02.650
I am not looking for the future of this world.

379
00:27:02.809 --> 00:27:06.390
I am so glad that my friends won't be there.

380
00:27:43.529 --> 00:27:47.910
And now when we get here, we need a whole new system.

381
00:27:50.130 --> 00:27:52.450
What does it say?

382
00:27:52.450 --> 00:28:09.960
We need to work out the ability to plan our role.

383
00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:10.799
Okay!

384
00:28:10.799 --> 00:28:14.119
What is it that we can do today?

385
00:28:14.490 --> 00:28:19.970
To develop a system where we will take some different ways.

386
00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:28.980
No.

387
00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:31.190
No?

388
00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:38.769
It just works, I got this.

389
00:28:38.769 --> 00:28:50.470
So, remember to like, subscribe, share, and like.

390
00:28:50.529 --> 00:28:55.140
And leave the connection with us.

391
00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:58.470
We'll meet you again next week.

392
00:28:58.549 --> 00:29:04.390
Thank you.

393
00:29:04.589 --> 00:29:06.329
Love you.

394
00:29:06.410 --> 00:29:07.490
Thank you, thank you.

395
00:29:07.569 --> 00:29:08.970
Thank you so much.

396
00:29:09.049 --> 00:29:10.329
Thank you.

397
00:29:10.410 --> 00:29:11.730
Bye, later!
