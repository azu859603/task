1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,480
Why did you just up and leave without saying anything?

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,240
Did you find another man with more money?

3
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:08,509
Don't you dare talk to me that way!

4
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:11,550
You don't get to act, don't lie to your mind now that you're rich.

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:12,910
You know why I left.

6
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:16,190
No, I don't. We've been spoken in 10 years.

7
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:16,750
Hey.

8
00:00:20,829 --> 00:00:23,070
Thank you. Who do you think you are?

9
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:25,469
Let's go.

10
00:00:25,469 --> 00:00:27,789
Mom and Dad's meeting didn't go great.

11
00:00:27,789 --> 00:00:29,550
I don't want to waste my time talking to them.

12
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:33,649
See?

13
00:00:33,649 --> 00:00:43,649
Even though she's black, she still doesn't know what it's going on.

14
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:46,689
I'm curious about what Caroline's been up to for the last 10 years. She's been away.

15
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:51,390
How's your candestication going?

16
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:52,990
She's gonna be a promise tonight.

17
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:56,189
Can't get STM grouped back from Victor without K's help.

18
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:57,070
Can you book me a seat?

19
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:00,109
I want to meet this amazing lawyer and person today.

20
00:01:00,109 --> 00:01:07,150
What do?
