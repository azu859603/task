00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.799
Cheers. Cheers.

2
00:00:02.799 --> 00:00:11.919
Thank you for everything yesterday.

3
00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:13.919
Of course.

4
00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:17.920
But how's it running into your past length?

5
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:24.140
I can't think of anything else except finding the true reason behind my parents' death.

6
00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:25.140
I'm not digging to that.

7
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.149
They're lying.

8
00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:31.149
So sorry to interrupt your date.

9
00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:35.149
It really sucks running into people that annoy you all the time.

10
00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:38.149
Are you just trying to rub it in that you're in a nice state with him?

11
00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:43.590
Are you out of your mind? It seems like you're following me.

12
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.539
Oh, you don't deserve that.

13
00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:53.340
We are actually here because we have a very important meeting with a lawyer, Kay.

14
00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.820
I really don't think she's going to leave you guys.
