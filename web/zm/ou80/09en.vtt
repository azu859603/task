00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.480
Ms. Kay I've offered you the best deal to join SDM group. What do you say?

2
00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:10.080
As I mentioned, the service fee needs to be increased and I need access to all the confidential

3
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:17.570
bios of SDM group. Otherwise I can't do my job. Money isn't an issue, but I'm sorry about

4
00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.370
the access. I can't do anything. I don't have the key to the database.

5
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:27.820
I can't work with a weak partner, Mr. Shaw. You can leave. We can't sign.

6
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.780
Ms. Kay I'm your best partner. You better go. I'm sorry. I've already refused the CEO

7
00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.500
of E.M. company entrance, but he isn't still leaving this for you. Thank you.

8
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:52.259
Mr. Shaw? Ms. Kay has to work. Please leave. Carol, I found out when the two cousins were competing

9
00:00:52.259 --> 00:00:57.539
and John started E.M., John's mother secretly transferred a lot of STM data into E.M.,

10
00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.020
so it's possible that the E.M. company is hiding the truth about your parents' deaths.

11
00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.819
Tell E.M. that I'll be at the party on time.
