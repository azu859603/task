1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,100
Tell E.M. that I'll be at the party, on time.

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:22,870
You two need to set a date for a wedding.

3
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:24,870
And then have a baby!

4
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:27,870
Love too, but I mean it's really up to John.

5
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:31,699
Let's focus on meeting Kay first.

6
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:35,700
For ten years you have been leading me on I want grandchildren.

7
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,700
Mom, Kay is coming tonight. I need to go check the preparations.

8
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,700
We can talk about this later.

9
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:42,700
Oh, okay.

10
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:46,250
Kay is the key to John's succession.

11
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,250
I understand.

12
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:54,340
If we can just please Kay this time, everything will turn off fine.
