1
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,070
She exudes elegance.

2
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:19,589
Heard you had a baby.

3
00:00:19,589 --> 00:00:21,190
Suppressed she kept her figure.

4
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:23,550
Hello, everyone.

5
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:24,910
I'm Kay.

6
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:27,269
As long as we can win her over,

7
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:34,829
victory is secured.

8
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:39,149
But you can call me Caroline.

9
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:42,320
Dear you impersonate Kay!

10
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,500
You're a joke.

11
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,340
Why would you even pretend to be Kay?

12
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:48,219
Caroline, stop messing around.

13
00:00:48,219 --> 00:00:50,140
You know Kay is very important to me.

14
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,179
This is a high society party.

15
00:00:52,179 --> 00:00:54,060
How does she even get in?

16
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:57,109
I got an invitation from EM.

17
00:00:57,109 --> 00:01:00,189
But it seems that EM is not taking

18
00:01:00,189 --> 00:01:02,840
a working relationship seriously.

19
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:07,870
Get the hell out of here.

20
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:08,870
Well, hold on.

21
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:15,879
Let's get things clear first.

22
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:19,849
This couldn't have dumped off that building.

23
00:01:19,849 --> 00:01:22,370
There wasn't enough evidence to prove otherwise.

24
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:27,750
Your parents' case can only be closed as a suicide.

25
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:31,670
But we did find this at the scene.

26
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:35,230
It seems too chaotic to prove who was there.

27
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:38,469
This is the only photo captured by the nearby surveillance

28
00:01:38,469 --> 00:01:39,609
camera.

29
00:01:39,609 --> 00:01:42,469
And although the person is blurred in the photo,

30
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:45,480
the brooch was clearly taken.

31
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:54,599
I seduced my son.

32
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:57,000
Your parents killed themselves.

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,519
You're a small company when bankrupt.

34
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:04,439
And through school, all alone.

35
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:07,120
And then you were an intern at STM.

36
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,960
You tried to marry into money.

37
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,669
Rebecca was there that night.

38
00:02:12,669 --> 00:02:15,270
Could she be the murderer of my parents?

39
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:21,150
A girl from a family like yours is no match for my John.

40
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,710
Elena will be his wife.

41
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:26,430
I need to stay and find out the truth.

42
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:30,740
You're daydreaming.

43
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:31,939
You wait.

44
00:02:31,939 --> 00:02:35,750
I will have my revenge.

45
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:38,509
Daydreaming again.

46
00:02:38,509 --> 00:02:46,120
Let's not do this.

47
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:50,360
I didn't want to hit an old person.

48
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:54,460
So this was for your mother.

49
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:58,419
You hit John and called him a cheating womanizer.

50
00:02:58,419 --> 00:03:00,060
You need to leave.

51
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:04,180
I will take out your eyes if you speak to me that way again.

52
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,699
Which one would you prefer?

53
00:03:05,699 --> 00:03:08,180
Your left or your right or perhaps both?

54
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,659
You're insane.

55
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:11,610
Get her out of here.

56
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:13,330
She's not the real K.

57
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:16,210
The real K went to Oxford.

58
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:18,199
Oxford is over, Rebecca.

59
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:21,400
I am going to teach you a lesson.

60
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,000
That's enough.

61
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,740
We can discuss these issues another time.

62
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,139
Please leave.

63
00:03:27,139 --> 00:03:30,379
Now.

64
00:03:30,379 --> 00:03:39,879
Not everyone gets the chance to work with me.

65
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:41,699
And my cousin.

66
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:43,539
What a fabulous boy.

67
00:03:43,539 --> 00:03:47,099
The two cousins are going to have a real showdown today.

68
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:51,939
Now, since my dear cousin wants to kick out, K, how about you

69
00:03:51,939 --> 00:03:53,810
let me have her?

70
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:57,689
What do you think?

71
00:03:57,689 --> 00:04:01,879
Now, since my dear cousin wants to kick out, K,

72
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:05,180
how about you let me have her?

73
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:09,500
Seems like you're not having such a good time at STM.

74
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,419
And you have to play tricks on John.

75
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:15,009
Could Caroline really be K?

76
00:04:15,009 --> 00:04:15,969
No.

77
00:04:15,969 --> 00:04:18,569
This must be a trap set by Victor.

78
00:04:18,569 --> 00:04:20,910
Please leave.

79
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:23,899
Both of you.

80
00:04:23,899 --> 00:04:25,870
Your loss?

81
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:29,670
Victor, would you like to work with me?

82
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:33,459
It'd be my honor.

83
00:04:33,459 --> 00:04:35,220
Meet me tomorrow to sign.

84
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:44,660
K, K. I'll see you tomorrow on time.

85
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:54,649
They put on a good show, but we won't.

86
00:04:54,649 --> 00:04:57,029
You got K's picture?

87
00:04:57,029 --> 00:05:02,089
What do you mean I know her?

88
00:05:02,089 --> 00:05:04,480
You got K's picture?

89
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,959
What do you mean I know her?

90
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:07,920
What does Sam Hill say?

91
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:12,259
It's Caroline.

92
00:05:12,259 --> 00:05:13,500
I don't believe it.

93
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,100
She has nothing.

94
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,329
You've been played.

95
00:05:17,329 --> 00:05:21,600
Caroline, wait.

96
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,569
They're never going to believe I'm K.

97
00:05:24,569 --> 00:05:26,879
Wait till the right moment.

98
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:34,459
And then release my father.

99
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:37,259
My parents were murdered by your mother.

100
00:05:37,339 --> 00:05:40,339
You don't even know we have a son.

101
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:44,339
I've spent 10 years dreaming of seeing you again.

102
00:05:44,339 --> 00:05:47,470
You look beautiful tonight.

103
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:50,350
I see you've learned how to sweet talk women.

104
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,709
I gave you a chance.

105
00:05:52,709 --> 00:05:54,329
Now get out of my way.

106
00:05:54,329 --> 00:05:59,439
They're all let's talk.

107
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:01,160
They're all let's talk.

108
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,939
They want to talk about it.

109
00:06:03,939 --> 00:06:07,100
You spent 10 years working to impress other people.

110
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,220
Why?

111
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,500
This is what you want to talk about?

112
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,779
Don't work for Victor.

113
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:13,860
He's got a crooked heart.

114
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,009
He's using you.

115
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:19,750
Look who's talking.

116
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:23,980
I work for whoever pays more.

117
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:26,910
$20 million.

118
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:27,670
What?

119
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:30,750
I'll pay you $20 million to be my personal lawyer.

120
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:35,759
You can set any other conditions as long as you don't work for Victor.

121
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,790
The contract will be one year.

122
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:41,879
And we'll be dealing with each other.

123
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:44,649
Besides, I don't like crowds.

124
00:06:44,649 --> 00:06:49,970
So I better have a quiet office.

125
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:57,050
If you agree, what are you doing?

126
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,730
I'm afraid you'll change your mind.

127
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:03,339
What are you doing?

128
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:12,579
I'm afraid you'll change your mind.

129
00:07:12,579 --> 00:07:14,620
The contract is signed.

130
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:20,839
Where would you like me to be based?

131
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:25,060
I said I wanted a quiet office.

132
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,939
What are you trying to do?

133
00:07:26,939 --> 00:07:33,029
In the whole building, nothing is quieter than the president's office.

134
00:07:33,029 --> 00:07:35,629
Is this how you treat your partners?

135
00:07:35,629 --> 00:07:39,079
I'll have Samuel move out tomorrow.

136
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:40,819
It's getting late.

137
00:07:40,819 --> 00:07:44,269
Let me take you home first.

138
00:07:44,269 --> 00:07:51,870
I'll put up with it for the sake of the confidential information.

139
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:59,370
With you under my nose, sooner or later, I'll know the truth about 10 years ago.

140
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:06,079
John, what is she doing in the CEO's office?

141
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:08,560
Caroline is now my personal lawyer.

142
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,079
And please watch her language.

143
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:14,019
This spot is reserved for the executive assistant.

144
00:08:14,019 --> 00:08:15,860
It's not company policy to have her here.

145
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:18,060
I make Ems rules.

146
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:21,259
Why are you here, Elena?

147
00:08:21,259 --> 00:08:23,259
Report from the project department is ready.

148
00:08:23,259 --> 00:08:26,720
It needs to be thoroughly evaluated.

149
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,269
I guess since you're the lawyer.

150
00:08:31,269 --> 00:08:35,259
I don't have the report on my desk by noon.

151
00:08:35,259 --> 00:08:37,700
No problem.

152
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,799
Caroline, you'll never beat me.

153
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:45,740
Today, Caroline is going to stop by the project department to verify information.

154
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:58,889
Don't let her get off too easily.

155
00:08:58,889 --> 00:08:59,690
Sorry.

156
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:02,090
It's fine.

157
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:03,129
Sorry.

158
00:09:03,129 --> 00:09:09,730
Didn't mean to.

159
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:14,139
I didn't mean to do that either.

160
00:09:14,139 --> 00:09:15,980
I didn't mean to do that either.

161
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:19,129
You've been choked over you hit me.

162
00:09:19,129 --> 00:09:21,330
I do not need to know who you are.

163
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:25,259
Would you need to know that your boss invited me here today?

164
00:09:25,259 --> 00:09:29,179
Now, should I go get the materials for the project meeting?

165
00:09:29,179 --> 00:09:31,820
Or would you like to get them for me?

166
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,139
I'll get them for you.

167
00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:42,450
Thank you.

168
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:44,450
Here's a fake document.

169
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:56,820
If it gets to her, the evaluation data will have major issues.

170
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,090
Are you sure this is the right one?

171
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:01,580
Mistakes are legally liable.

172
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,549
Of course.

173
00:10:03,549 --> 00:10:05,039
Okay.

174
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:13,120
Thank you.

175
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,590
Everything is set.

176
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:16,190
I gave her the fake documents.

177
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:20,399
Once she finishes her evaluation, make sure to swap the fake documents back.

178
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,000
Don't leave any evidence.

179
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,730
Got it.

180
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:27,570
Let's go to dinner.

181
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:28,850
But no, I can't.

182
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:30,929
I have so much work, I've got to get done.

183
00:10:30,929 --> 00:10:32,210
Come on.

184
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:39,070
You're coming?

185
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:39,870
Oh, I'm good.

186
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:40,350
Thank you.

187
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:50,450
Mary.

188
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:55,019
I saw the evaluation report.

189
00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:55,580
It's finished.

190
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:58,080
And I'm on my way to the director's office.

191
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:09,299
So I thought I'd deliver it for you.

192
00:11:09,299 --> 00:11:12,179
So EM has started an artificial intelligence project.

193
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:14,830
Leo would be perfect for you.

194
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:16,669
Would you concern him for working in the lab?

195
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:18,029
No.

196
00:11:18,029 --> 00:11:19,149
He's too young.

197
00:11:19,149 --> 00:11:20,830
He has a talent for Matthew and Cody.

198
00:11:21,659 --> 00:11:22,620
Who's child is he?

199
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,360
He's not.

200
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:25,840
You're me.

201
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:27,490
I lift you up.

202
00:11:28,429 --> 00:11:29,230
You're not married.

203
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:32,129
Also, Leo is 10 years old.

204
00:11:32,129 --> 00:11:33,409
Is that just a coincidence?

205
00:11:36,179 --> 00:11:36,500
Ben.

206
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:38,129
What?

207
00:11:38,129 --> 00:11:40,690
Ben is Leo's father.

208
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,409
It doesn't matter whether or not we're married.

209
00:11:43,409 --> 00:11:48,299
As long as he loves Leo.

210
00:11:48,379 --> 00:11:49,179
Hello?

211
00:11:49,179 --> 00:11:51,100
John, the project evaluation report is out.

212
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:51,899
This afternoon,

213
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:54,419
S company is going to have a meeting to discuss it.

214
00:11:54,419 --> 00:11:56,419
We all need to be there, including Kay.

215
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:57,860
All right.

216
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:58,899
We'll be there.

217
00:11:58,899 --> 00:12:09,820
The vulnerabilities in the assessment report are so significant.

218
00:12:10,539 --> 00:12:12,299
I wonder how she'll get out of this one.

219
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:13,340
Yeah.

220
00:12:14,139 --> 00:12:16,860
She is missing the opportunity for cooperation.

221
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:19,100
John's definitely going to blame her.

222
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,980
Kay's reputation in the industry will be completely tarnished.

223
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:24,059
No one will dare cooperate with her.

224
00:12:24,059 --> 00:12:25,019
It's okay.

225
00:12:31,059 --> 00:12:32,100
Mr. Easton,

226
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,179
I have been working with your company for years

227
00:12:34,179 --> 00:12:37,460
and I have never seen an assessment report this terrible.

228
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:38,500
Is this a joke?

229
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,620
Mr. Wessel,

230
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,220
there must be some kind of misunderstanding

231
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,460
but the project's been going very smoothly.

232
00:12:44,289 --> 00:12:46,820
This is so unprofessional.

233
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,500
It is full of mistakes.

234
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,740
That report was written by the top lawyer, Kay.

235
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,740
So there shouldn't be any issues.

236
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:53,779
Right?

237
00:12:54,769 --> 00:12:56,850
Caroline, care to explain?

238
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:00,049
How do you explain a lack of professionalism?

239
00:13:00,049 --> 00:13:00,610
I'm sorry.

240
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,250
I'm afraid this means we can no longer be partners.

241
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,879
Mr. Wessel, you can't make that decision.

242
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:07,840
What did you just say?

243
00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:09,820
Kay is right.

244
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,100
Robert, you don't have the qualifications

245
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,299
to decide who to cooperate with.

246
00:13:21,419 --> 00:13:22,460
What are you doing here?

247
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:23,659
If I hadn't have come,

248
00:13:23,659 --> 00:13:25,500
you would have missed out on a great project.

249
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,779
What does the president winch mean?

250
00:13:29,629 --> 00:13:31,149
This is the assessment done by Kay.

251
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:33,519
What's your holding statement?

252
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:34,240
What?

253
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:36,610
The assessment is flawless.

254
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,610
Kay really is as good as they say.

255
00:13:39,649 --> 00:13:40,289
Impossible.

256
00:13:40,289 --> 00:13:43,169
Like, would you say that you knew

257
00:13:43,169 --> 00:13:45,409
there was a problem with the assessment file

258
00:13:45,409 --> 00:13:47,649
and insisted on giving it to Elena?

259
00:13:47,649 --> 00:13:51,700
Or are you surprised that even with the fake data

260
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:52,740
that you gave me,

261
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:56,370
I was able to present a place where the assessment report.

262
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:58,129
Caroline, undoing me.

263
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:01,629
Care to explain this?

264
00:14:05,549 --> 00:14:09,789
That's evidence of you sneaking into my office

265
00:14:09,789 --> 00:14:11,070
and switching the documents.

266
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:12,669
You tricked me!

267
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:17,259
Mary, fired!

268
00:14:17,259 --> 00:14:20,539
President, this is a misunderstanding.

269
00:14:35,539 --> 00:14:37,220
You knew Mary was playing tricks.

270
00:14:39,409 --> 00:14:41,889
Why did you let her do something so foolish?

271
00:14:41,889 --> 00:14:43,809
It raises questions when someone

272
00:14:43,809 --> 00:14:45,250
comes at you for no reason.

273
00:14:45,809 --> 00:14:46,929
We've changed.

274
00:14:46,929 --> 00:14:48,289
It's hard not to change

275
00:14:48,289 --> 00:14:50,129
after everything I've been through alone.

276
00:15:11,259 --> 00:15:12,860
That bitch calls me my job.

277
00:15:14,059 --> 00:15:15,500
I'll never let her off the hook.

278
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,830
You know, there is an opportunity right now

279
00:15:18,909 --> 00:15:19,950
for us to get revenge.

280
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:29,200
Mom, was work smooth yesterday?

281
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,360
I had some trouble,

282
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,759
but it's all smooth to open up.

283
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:34,399
What about that?

284
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,200
Did he help you?

285
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:38,879
Leo, I don't want to have to tell you again.

286
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:40,879
John is not your father.

287
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:42,000
I want a dad.

288
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,360
John would be good.

289
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:45,740
I'll think it over.

290
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:48,860
Carefully, now please eat your breakfast.

291
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,340
Mom?

292
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,370
Got a problem.

293
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:57,840
Mom?

294
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:03,419
Someone is spreading lies about your own life.

295
00:16:03,419 --> 00:16:05,179
I'm trying to harm your reputation.

296
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,360
I'll deal with this.

297
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,960
You go get ready for school.

298
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,919
I saw it.

299
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:11,519
The photos of Caroline and that man.

300
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,399
I mean, guys.

301
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:20,669
Are those rumors said online?

302
00:16:20,669 --> 00:16:21,309
True?

303
00:16:21,309 --> 00:16:22,110
Of course not.

304
00:16:22,669 --> 00:16:23,710
They're rumors.

305
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:24,909
That man richer than me?

306
00:16:25,629 --> 00:16:27,230
How much money did he give you?

307
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:28,110
You know what, John?

308
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:30,240
He did give me more.

309
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,679
And he's better in bed than you.

310
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:36,960
Are you satisfied?

311
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,840
Where did he touch you?

312
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:47,789
What made you so promiscuous

313
00:16:47,789 --> 00:16:49,389
he's lasting years?

314
00:16:49,389 --> 00:16:51,230
You've got me all wrong, John.

315
00:16:52,299 --> 00:16:53,100
Move!

316
00:16:53,100 --> 00:17:04,430
You're so stupid.

317
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:08,420
You can't even see such an obvious trap.

318
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:08,980
What's this?

319
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:11,059
You know what to do next, right?

320
00:17:11,619 --> 00:17:12,500
Why give it to me?

321
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:14,690
Because compared to others,

322
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:18,109
you're a good candidate to be my dad.

323
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:20,460
You need to win my mom's time.

324
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:21,579
This is my phone number.

325
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:23,680
You can contact me any time.

326
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,500
Hand over all the evidence to the police

327
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,140
and let Mary know there's consequences for spreading rumors.

328
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:39,009
I looked into the transfer of the company's database

329
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,240
and I found evidence that your parents were killed.

330
00:17:43,089 --> 00:17:45,890
Problem is, the information's at the core of the app,

331
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:47,890
which is nearly impossible to access.

332
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:49,329
You go first.

333
00:17:49,329 --> 00:17:50,640
I'll pick you right now.

334
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,759
No, I'm going with you.

335
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:52,799
You can't do this by yourself.

336
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,839
And candidly, I don't trust John.

337
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:00,750
I think he still has feelings for you.

338
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,269
I'm still your boss.

339
00:18:02,269 --> 00:18:13,069
Carolina, I want to apologize for my behavior just now.

340
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:15,859
I know you're not that kind of person.

341
00:18:15,859 --> 00:18:19,279
Mr. Easton, if there's nothing else, I'd like to get back to work.

342
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:21,680
I've already sent the person who spread those rumors to prison.

343
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,200
Would you send your mother to prison for me?

344
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,579
I'm sincerely trying to apologize.

345
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:35,549
No, my behavior was offensive

346
00:18:35,549 --> 00:18:37,309
and my attitude towards you was wrong.

347
00:18:37,869 --> 00:18:40,509
But I was just angry that you disappeared for 10 years.

348
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:44,220
I've come to realize I can't help but care for you, Caroline.

349
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:46,700
Can we start over?

350
00:18:47,779 --> 00:18:50,980
You and your employees have something against me.

351
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:54,579
There isn't the slightest bit of trust and you want to start over.

352
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:03,150
This is the key to the company's database,

353
00:19:03,789 --> 00:19:06,109
which grants you access to all the core files.

354
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:08,049
I'm giving it to you.

355
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,329
He actually trusts me with this,

356
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:16,690
willing to hand over the core of the company.

357
00:19:17,329 --> 00:19:23,089
To me, you don't have to do this.

358
00:19:23,089 --> 00:19:23,490
It's okay.

359
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:37,009
I've waited 10 years and going a little longer.

360
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,490
If you must blame someone, blame your mother.

361
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:41,569
For killing my parents.

362
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:20,240
This is the contract signed between Rebecca and my parents' company,

363
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:23,420
with a price three times higher.

364
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:25,660
My parents' death wasn't an accident.

365
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:35,819
That John's mother spends the rest of her life prison.

366
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:37,259
How can I trust you?

367
00:20:37,259 --> 00:20:42,779
Because I'm competing with John for the same position of CEO of the STM Corporation.

368
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:45,420
I think we would make great partners.

369
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,700
I'll get you an answer soon.

370
00:20:57,069 --> 00:21:00,029
John, what are you doing in my house?

371
00:21:00,029 --> 00:21:02,109
Mom, I asked them to come over.

372
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:06,029
Because the light bulb was broken and he came to fix it.

373
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:12,829
Well, it looks like the light bulb is fixed, so you can leave.

374
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:17,200
Are you okay?

375
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,140
You don't look well.

376
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,900
You need to take a few days off the rest.

377
00:21:21,819 --> 00:21:22,539
I'm fine.

378
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:27,740
I would appreciate if you did not come into my home without an invitation.

379
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:34,539
Oh, the school is hosting a parent child activity that requires both parents to be present.

380
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:36,930
Can I invite John?

381
00:21:37,789 --> 00:21:38,349
Oh.

382
00:21:38,349 --> 00:21:42,190
The other kids have a dad.

383
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,660
Of course.

384
00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:46,660
You can invite him.

385
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:47,140
Awesome.

386
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:48,910
Well, it's getting late.

387
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:50,430
I'll head home now.

388
00:21:51,539 --> 00:21:52,819
I'll see you tomorrow, Leo.

389
00:21:52,819 --> 00:21:53,779
See you tomorrow, Dad.

390
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:08,380
Well, it's ugly, but I appreciate it.

391
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,190
Tell me.

392
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:13,549
What should I do?

393
00:22:13,549 --> 00:22:26,099
Oh, wow.

394
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,859
Here, make one with us.

395
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:34,299
John, if I send your mother to present, would you still love me?

396
00:22:34,299 --> 00:22:39,420
What do you look at?

397
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,619
You want to present my mom?

398
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:42,619
What's your idea?

399
00:22:42,619 --> 00:22:45,740
No woman can refuse a romantic marriage proposal.

400
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:48,380
My mom's birthday is coming up in a few days.

401
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:49,500
You understand what I mean?

402
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,039
I understand.

403
00:23:00,349 --> 00:23:03,309
It's in tonight's dinner quite special.

404
00:23:03,309 --> 00:23:04,750
Did John do this for me?

405
00:23:05,549 --> 00:23:07,789
He still remembers me birthday.

406
00:23:07,789 --> 00:23:09,950
Caroline, why are you here?

407
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,490
I'm trying to have a nice dinner with my son.

408
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:14,930
Why are you here?

409
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:17,490
Tonight is John and mine's engagement party.

410
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:21,970
This entire candlelight dinner was prepared for me.

411
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:25,740
God, everything was just wishful thinking.

412
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:28,140
Why am I so fantasizing about John?

413
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:31,809
Leo, come on.

414
00:23:38,829 --> 00:23:41,359
Wait for me.

415
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:42,400
Will you take Leo home?

416
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:44,319
What about you?

417
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:47,619
It's time to put him into this.

418
00:23:50,299 --> 00:23:51,859
You can't let him wait.

419
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:57,059
Look, I don't know what happened to make you leave in such a hurry.

420
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,140
But what I want to tell you is,

421
00:23:59,859 --> 00:24:02,180
even though you left without saying goodbye for 10 years,

422
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:04,019
and even though you have a child with someone else,

423
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,640
I find that I cannot stop loving you.

424
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:15,819
So, will you marry me?

425
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,900
John, do you enjoy playing with my feelings?

426
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:24,559
Just humiliating me?

427
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:26,400
Accomplish anything for you?

428
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,640
I don't understand what you're saying,

429
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,319
but my love for you has never changed.

430
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,250
The contract ends in one year.

431
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:41,890
Then I'll leave.

432
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:45,069
And we'll just be strangers.

433
00:24:56,609 --> 00:24:59,470
Victor, let's meet.

434
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:06,079
It's bad, John.

435
00:25:07,099 --> 00:25:09,019
Your mother has been arrested for the police.
