00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160
Wait, why was she arrested?

2
00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.259
She's been accused of murder.

3
00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.460
Allegedly, she killed two people from W Company 10 years ago.

4
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.580
10 years ago?

5
00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.820
I've seen the records from those people from Company W.

6
00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:14.740
Weren't they killed in an accident?

7
00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.260
How does this have to do with my mother?

8
00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.899
She was president of the crime.

9
00:00:19.899 --> 00:00:23.260
The two people that died were Caroline's parents.

10
00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.239
What?

11
00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:26.320
Where's Caroline?

12
00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.800
I can't reach her over the phone.

13
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.870
John, I found something suspicious.

14
00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.310
A few days ago, Caroline was seen entering the records room,

15
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:36.149
alone.

16
00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.829
Wait, is she tamper with anything?

17
00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.310
Find Caroline at all cost.

18
00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.259
Caroline, this time?

19
00:00:43.259 --> 00:00:49.340
I'm going to make sure you disappear from the world forever.

20
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.539
That's for what you did at the cocktail party.

21
00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.640
It was you.

22
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.439
Why are you doing this?

23
00:00:55.439 --> 00:01:03.320
To get rid of you, once you're dead, John will be mine forever.

24
00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.500
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

25
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.659
You know that evidence you found in the records room?

26
00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:11.659
It was fake.

27
00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:22.030
Since you're going to die anyway, it doesn't really matter

28
00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.510
if I tell you.

29
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.769
Rebecca, you shouldn't kill your mother.

30
00:01:28.769 --> 00:01:30.170
She's just a scapegoat.
