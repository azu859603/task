00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:07.179
Our friendship has always just been a partnership.

2
00:00:07.179 --> 00:00:09.179
Don't take it too seriously.

3
00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:13.250
John, guess me.

4
00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:15.250
You betrayed me.

5
00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:24.359
First you used me, and then you pushed me away.

6
00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.739
Who I'm going to be heartbroken?

7
00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:28.129
No.

8
00:00:28.129 --> 00:00:30.260
Thanks for playing along.

9
00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.450
Don't forget, you know, through your job.

10
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:51.030
Everyone's you, true of me.

11
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.579
Are you better?

12
00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.729
You're in such a hurry to leave the hospital.

13
00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:02.789
Were you going to leave without saying goodbye?

14
00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.790
Or are you going to see Victor?

15
00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.209
I understand that I have made mistakes.

16
00:01:08.209 --> 00:01:11.209
I will restore your mother's innocence.

17
00:01:11.209 --> 00:01:16.239
And when she is released from prison, I will leave E.M.

18
00:01:16.239 --> 00:01:20.230
Then we don't know each other anything.

19
00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:22.230
Do you really want to leave like this again?

20
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:27.909
John, let's let each other.
