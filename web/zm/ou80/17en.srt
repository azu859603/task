00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:10,439
We've been running the case. Did you suffer in prison? You've been working so hard

2
00:00:11,699 --> 00:00:16,500
Prison gave me time to think I want a grandchild

3
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:20,000
You too need to get married as soon as possible

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,140
Mom do you want me to die before I meet my grandchild?

5
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:47,109
Promise John and I are getting married soon. So you must come and celebrate

6
00:00:47,109 --> 00:00:55,990
Oh, um, congratulations. Why don't we celebrate tonight? Sure

7
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:08,349
Great. I will get back to work my letter of resignation
