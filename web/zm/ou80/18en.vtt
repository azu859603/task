00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.139
I'll put the money for the penalty in your account tomorrow, and I'll leave.

2
00:00:05.139 --> 00:00:08.140
For Victor, you'd rather pay the high penalty than be with me?

3
00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.140
This isn't about him.

4
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.140
I told you once your mother was out of prison, I would go.

5
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.140
I don't need the penalty money.

6
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:30.969
You love Elena. I just got an invitation to your wedding.

7
00:00:30.969 --> 00:00:40.920
I don't blame you for the situation with my mother.

8
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.920
But if you want to be with Victor, I won't let you.

9
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.340
As long as I don't break the contract, you can't leave.
