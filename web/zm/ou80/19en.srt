1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,339
These are the documents from the STM and W Corporation project.

2
00:00:07,339 --> 00:00:13,070
They might help you find the murderer.

3
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:14,070
What do you mean?

4
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,070
I found out that you left John because you suspected me

5
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:22,199
of killing your parents instead of because I told you to.

6
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:24,199
Don't worry.

7
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:26,199
Even without the information that you provided,

8
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:28,199
I was going to leave.

9
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:33,149
There's one other thing I have to ask of me.

10
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:38,789
This is a critical time for STM Corporation's succession.

11
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:43,789
Help John secure the investment for the project with company S.

12
00:00:43,789 --> 00:00:49,039
The STM CEO position is very important to us.

13
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,039
Consider it my compensation for the hardback cost.

14
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,299
Thank you.

15
00:00:54,299 --> 00:00:56,700
Thank you.

16
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:01,799
EM's business investment plan report, this time has been done well.

17
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:07,079
It includes a detailed risk prevention strategy.

18
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:11,079
This time I'm going to expose your true face, you wicked woman.

19
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:12,079
Let's take a look.
