1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,609
How could it have leaked? Do you know what company has access to the data?

2
00:00:03,609 --> 00:00:10,460
It's a company run by Victor, but most importantly, go ahead and say it.

3
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:15,060
Elena, she's been released on bail and he seems she's the one who held that picture.

4
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:18,019
Of course Elena is involved in this.

5
00:00:18,019 --> 00:00:19,640
Is that a problem?

6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:25,769
When I was kidnapped, Elena told me that someone else had murdered my parents

7
00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:28,250
and then Victor saved me.

8
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,250
It's not a coincidence that they're together now.

9
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:35,250
And if I can remember correctly, Victor was the person behind the scenes on the construction

10
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,250
product that SDM collaborated on with W Company.

11
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,380
There must be some connection.

12
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,409
Victor was behind the scenes this whole time.

13
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:45,500
I always thought someone else was in charge of that project.

14
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,659
Now it all makes sense.

15
00:00:48,659 --> 00:00:54,490
Victor is probably the real murderer of my parents.

16
00:00:54,490 --> 00:01:01,850
If it only had to do with the internal strife of the successors,

17
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:08,209
what does that have to do with my parents?

18
00:01:08,209 --> 00:01:12,209
John, do you like the first big gift I've given you?

19
00:01:12,209 --> 00:01:14,209
Get to it.
