00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
If you're willing to marry me, I'll stop.

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.599
And I'll tell you all of Victor's company's business secrets.

3
00:00:06.599 --> 00:00:08.820
How about that?

4
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.619
Elena, your actions are so childish.

5
00:00:11.619 --> 00:00:13.750
Turn to threaten me with this?

6
00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:18.800
John, you'll regret it.

7
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.800
Was that Elena? What did she want?

8
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.140
Nothing. She was trying to manipulate me.

9
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.539
I have to stay and find out if Victor is the real murder of my parents.

10
00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:33.829
I'm gonna put him in jail and make sure he receives the punishment he deserves.

11
00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:36.829
Now, the most important thing is to get the new sources.

12
00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:39.990
Our R&D project took three years.

13
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:44.149
If we want to find a new talent to redevelop, I'll first do eight.

14
00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:46.659
I didn't think about what to do next.

15
00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:50.369
Our company has basically been taken home as it is.

16
00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:56.240
You guys forgot about me.

17
00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.619
Rebecca, what are you doing here?
