00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.189
You guys forgot about me.

2
00:00:03.189 --> 00:00:06.629
Rebecca what are you doing here?

3
00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:13.630
Didn't dad hold an AI competition to find some core R&D personnel for the artificial intelligence project?

4
00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:15.630
Leo insisted.

5
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.629
He is concerned that EM is in trouble and he wants to help.

6
00:00:19.629 --> 00:00:24.070
Leo, do you really think you can handle that?

7
00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:25.070
I believe in Leo.

8
00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.070
I believe in myself too.

9
00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.100
I don't know how you look, he can help but he doesn't hurt you.

10
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.590
Come on.

11
00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.590
Leo is already handling things at the R&D center.

12
00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:39.590
We can't just sit idly by.

13
00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:40.590
What do you mean?

14
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.939
I am a shareholder at STM.

15
00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:50.939
Here is a key to the data center.

16
00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:53.939
Take it and let the truth come to light.
