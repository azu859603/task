00:00:01.899 --> 00:00:03.140
Let go of me.

2
00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:04.299
Victor, what are you doing?

3
00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:07.099
Oh, I suspect there are suspicious individuals

4
00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:09.500
innovating the records from attempting

5
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.179
to leak out SDM's trade sequence.

6
00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:15.179
What?

7
00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:15.939
Is one of the errors?

8
00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:18.870
Is there anything wrong with me reviewing the documents?

9
00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:19.809
Oh, but of course not.

10
00:00:19.809 --> 00:00:21.789
You can investigate as much as you want.

11
00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:26.620
That was talking about.

12
00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.500
Without proof of defamation.

13
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.100
Why in such a hurry?

14
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.689
It's just a routine interrogation, right?

15
00:00:33.689 --> 00:00:35.899
You're not guilty, are you?

16
00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:37.820
Afraid to cooperate with the law?

17
00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.719
I'm not afraid of anything.

18
00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:42.880
I hope you don't regret your actions.

19
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.750
Officers, take her out of here.

20
00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:48.509
Call Ben.

21
00:00:48.509 --> 00:00:52.789
He'll know what to do.

22
00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:57.869
Evan, let's go.

23
00:00:57.869 --> 00:01:00.469
I would consider that proposal I made on the phone.

24
00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:05.030
If you do, I may consider letting Caroline go.

25
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.750
Get out of here.
