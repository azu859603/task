1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
Get out of here.

2
00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:06.589
Victor is paying the police.

3
00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:08.589
We can't let him get away with this.

4
00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:14.859
Okay, I find a way to get Caroline out of there.

5
00:00:14.859 --> 00:00:16.859
Caroline's been arrested. She needs your help.

6
00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.219
Let's meet up at the end.

7
00:00:21.219 --> 00:00:23.219
Victor's definitely trying to pin everything on Caroline.

8
00:00:23.219 --> 00:00:27.219
What we need to do is gather all the evidence we can to prove Caroline's innocence and defend her in court.

9
00:00:27.219 --> 00:00:30.929
And the problem is, Victor doesn't leave a trace.

10
00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.500
Every crime leaves a trace, and Victor won't be an exception.

11
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.500
Do you know the relationship between Robert and Caroline?

12
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.500
I've been friends for years, but what's that got to do with proving Caroline's innocence?

13
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.570
Well, when Elena framed Caroline for the problematic evaluation report, they were dealing with an executive named Peter.

14
00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.570
What do you want me to do?

15
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.570
Well, at the time, he and Elena had a good relationship.

16
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.240
Perhaps he could be the breakthrough.

17
00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.240
I'll call Robert and set up a meeting with you too.
