1
00:00:01,649 --> 00:00:05,650
If it weren't for Caroline being in prison, I would consider meeting with you.

2
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:06,650
Go ahead.

3
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:08,650
What do you want to know?

4
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:10,650
It's an executive in your company named Peter.

5
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,869
Where is he?

6
00:00:12,869 --> 00:00:19,289
After what he and Elena did, which severely affected the company's interest, I fired him.

7
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:22,289
And he ended up in prison for robbery.

8
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:23,289
Robert?

9
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:25,480
His mother is severely ill.

10
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:29,480
And after leaving S group, he did not enough money to pay for his mother's illness.

11
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,769
He took the wrong time.

12
00:00:32,829 --> 00:00:36,210
Thank you.

13
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,429
Once this is over, I'm planning on proposing to Caroline.

14
00:00:39,429 --> 00:00:51,060
I hope you won't stand the way of that.

15
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,060
What do you want with me?

16
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,060
Do you know Victor?

17
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:56,020
No, I don't know him.

18
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:57,020
You're lying.

19
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:00,600
You know, I know about your mother.

20
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,600
Don't worry.

21
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,599
I have arranged for the best cardiologist for her.

22
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:05,599
She'll be fine.

23
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:06,730
Alright.

24
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:08,019
So what do you want from me?

25
00:01:08,019 --> 00:01:10,019
The trial is tomorrow.

26
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:12,019
I want you to judge everything you know.

27
00:01:12,019 --> 00:01:14,019
I'll vouch for you.

28
00:01:14,019 --> 00:01:17,019
Get you bail and then arrange a high paying job for you.
