00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.120
Carolina.

2
00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.990
Defended.

3
00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:16.109
The plaintiff hereby declares that you have sold many company secrets to plead guilty.

4
00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.949
I do not plead guilty.

5
00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:19.629
Your honor, I did not do it.

6
00:00:19.629 --> 00:00:21.829
Do you have evidence to prove this?

7
00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:28.870
I was involved with the companies that are mentioned in the case, but I have not entered

8
00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:33.740
internally any of the client offices.

9
00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.259
How could I have linked the secrets?

10
00:00:36.259 --> 00:00:40.659
When cooperating with EM, you were placed in the internal offices.

11
00:00:40.659 --> 00:00:46.520
Not long after, core research from EM's artificial intelligence project was leaked.

12
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:54.500
As a former director of EM and as Victor's current employee, I have reason to suspect

13
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.340
that you are the one who leaked the secrets.

14
00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.240
But I don't have the key to EM's database.

15
00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.270
You do.

16
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.920
Plus, I have video evidence showing you entering the database, so...

17
00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.200
Wait, given this evidence is conclusive, I am now...

18
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:18.879
Wait, we have another witness who can prove that Caroline did not release trade secrets.
