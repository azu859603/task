00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.690
Where is this witness?

2
00:00:08.949 --> 00:00:14.300
My name is Peter Russell, and I can prove that Caroline has committed no crimes.

3
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:21.420
What evidence do you have?

4
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:28.460
Victor and Elena have threatened me and my mother to sabotage Caroline in the evaluation meetings.

5
00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:37.700
And I overheard Elena plotting to frame Caroline, and I have her home recording.

6
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:43.700
What is this? This is A.I. This is fate. Plus, he's a criminal. He can't be trusted.

7
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.700
All videos presented in this court are original. I have been tested for authenticity.

8
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.700
I hereby declare the defendant is not guilty, release her.

9
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.920
What?

10
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.939
Caroline, go to hell.

11
00:00:59.939 --> 00:01:44.010
Ben.

12
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.640
Uncle Ben, see you on heaven.

13
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:54.659
It's assured.

14
00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.659
Your death will not be in vain.

15
00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.579
We punish them.

16
00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.709
With the law.

17
00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:04.709
Leo has already broken through the core problem, A.I.

18
00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:08.099
It's time to let Victor taste the pain of losing everything.

19
00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:18.009
The life-sensing should be done in about a week.

20
00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:21.189
One second.

21
00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:23.189
It's the matter. Why do you feel so plustered?

22
00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:29.189
John has enlisted the help of a master's in mathematical algorithms who has already broken through to the key research and development of our visual intelligence.

23
00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:34.189
I mean, our stock price has implemented to the critical point, and he's already here with the authorities to investigate the company.

24
00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:38.189
Oh my God, I thought it was something serious. I already transferred all the funds.

25
00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:40.189
They won't be able to find anything.

26
00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:44.189
Well, they also found evidence of you murdering an employee to embezzle that project fund years ago.

27
00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:47.219
Uh, yeah, I'll call you right back.

28
00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:49.379
Boss, you should flee now.

29
00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:51.610
Did you do what I told you?

30
00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.610
The doctors may pay. I mean, the files are ready.

31
00:02:53.610 --> 00:03:11.740
I must have gotten wind of it and fled early.

32
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:17.669
He'll be caught soon.

33
00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:19.740
Hey Doc, do we have it?

34
00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:24.460
This is all I can do for you.

35
00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:25.580
They find out.

36
00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:45.949
Like I lose my job.

37
00:03:45.949 --> 00:04:00.099
He's not here.

38
00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:01.580
What happened?

39
00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:02.580
Victor is taking Leo.

40
00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:03.580
What?

41
00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.060
Don't worry.

42
00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.060
I'll get him back.

43
00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.580
I'm coming with you.

44
00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.620
It's here.

45
00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.479
Let's do this.

46
00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:35.350
Victor, take it out on me. Don't hurt Leo.

47
00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:36.350
Yeah.

48
00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.529
Make sense because we're a little kid.

49
00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:42.750
Even Elena likes you.

50
00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.680
Why?

51
00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:51.660
Victor!

52
00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.180
Calm down.

53
00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.550
Just talk this through.

54
00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:57.860
You know I'm going back.

55
00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.019
So you make my life miserable.

56
00:05:01.019 --> 00:05:05.259
Slide turn to make yours miserable.

57
00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:07.259
You're going to lose everything.

58
00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:20.420
You're going to lose everything.

59
00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:23.100
You think she's exploited?

60
00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:24.100
Victor!

61
00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.100
Victor, do you want the CEO position to STM?

62
00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.160
If you put down the gun, I will step down.

63
00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.160
Stop.

64
00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.660
Get lying to me!

65
00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:38.290
You think I'm going to believe your lies?

66
00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:40.290
I might give you two choices.

67
00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:43.720
Shut up!

68
00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.069
Ethan!

69
00:05:45.069 --> 00:05:46.420
You'll kill Carmine.

70
00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:48.810
Or I'm going to kill your son.

71
00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:51.540
You only can't save one.

72
00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:52.540
What are you saying?

73
00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:54.629
My kid?

74
00:05:55.629 --> 00:05:57.629
You didn't know Leo's your son?

75
00:05:57.629 --> 00:05:59.629
How fucking pathetic is that?

76
00:05:59.629 --> 00:06:00.629
Carmine, is this true?

77
00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:01.629
Is he really my son?

78
00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:05.209
No, you're meant to see two, haven't you?

79
00:06:05.209 --> 00:06:07.209
All right, and it doesn't feel good, does it?

80
00:06:07.209 --> 00:06:09.209
To be the one who's the fool, now does it?

81
00:06:09.209 --> 00:06:10.209
Yes!

82
00:06:10.209 --> 00:06:11.209
Yes!

83
00:06:11.209 --> 00:06:18.740
We always...

84
00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:20.740
You said you won't make a choice.

85
00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:21.740
I'll make a pro, yeah.

86
00:06:21.740 --> 00:07:12.300
He's lucky.

87
00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:19.589
If I hadn't asked for revenge, none of this would have happened.

88
00:07:19.589 --> 00:07:21.980
You can't blame yourself.

89
00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:23.980
You blame Victor.

90
00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:28.560
Who's the family of the patient?

91
00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:29.689
I am.

92
00:07:29.689 --> 00:07:33.689
The patient's in critical condition and needs a family member's signature immediately.

93
00:07:33.689 --> 00:07:34.689
I'll sign.

94
00:07:34.689 --> 00:07:38.149
Do our best.

95
00:07:38.149 --> 00:07:47.100
You're able to remove the bullet from the patient.

96
00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:49.100
Hey, then move the patient over.

97
00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:52.439
Thank you, doctor.

98
00:07:52.439 --> 00:08:08.100
You wake up soon.

99
00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:39.929
Leo can't be...

100
00:08:39.929 --> 00:08:46.370
John.

101
00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:47.820
Oh, Leo.

102
00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:49.679
Leo's okay.

103
00:08:49.679 --> 00:08:51.679
He's a little bit scared, but it's nothing serious.

104
00:08:51.679 --> 00:08:54.059
I want to get you, Leo.

105
00:08:54.059 --> 00:08:55.509
Would you like that?

106
00:08:55.509 --> 00:09:01.379
I want to get you, Leo.

107
00:09:01.379 --> 00:09:02.990
Would you like that?

108
00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:04.309
John!

109
00:09:04.309 --> 00:09:05.309
John!

110
00:09:05.309 --> 00:09:07.570
I have fantastic news.

111
00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:11.490
It's the paternity paper.

112
00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:15.500
Who?

113
00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:16.500
He was your son?

114
00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:20.200
Oh, could you not tell me something so important?

115
00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:24.480
I just found out myself, Mom.

116
00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:28.149
Leo, let's give them some space, okay?

117
00:09:28.149 --> 00:09:35.970
Right?

118
00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:45.169
Since you now have a son, why not propose to his mother?

119
00:09:45.169 --> 00:09:53.190
I was going to propose until you barged in.

120
00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:56.190
I was going to propose until you barged in.

121
00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:57.450
Oh!

122
00:09:57.450 --> 00:10:00.909
Carry on!

123
00:10:00.909 --> 00:10:10.570
I'll take care of John for the night.

124
00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:24.289
You still haven't answered my question from earlier.

125
00:10:24.289 --> 00:10:27.210
Why?

126
00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:30.620
You can see, Leo, all you want.

127
00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:31.620
That's your right.

128
00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:36.600
Do I do something wrong?

129
00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.600
If I did, just tell me that I can change.

130
00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:41.299
There are some things I can forget.

131
00:10:41.299 --> 00:10:48.019
But there are others that I can never leave.

132
00:10:48.019 --> 00:10:56.879
Leo, this is an adult conversation.

133
00:10:56.879 --> 00:10:59.779
Mommy can handle this.

134
00:10:59.779 --> 00:11:02.809
Grandma will take you back home.

135
00:11:02.809 --> 00:11:04.809
Rebecca, do you mind taking Leo back?

136
00:11:04.809 --> 00:11:09.299
I need to have a serious talk with John.

137
00:11:09.299 --> 00:11:23.419
And years ago, I left for two reasons.

138
00:11:23.419 --> 00:11:27.419
The first reason was that I mistook your mother

139
00:11:27.419 --> 00:11:34.269
as the murderer of my parents and the other reason.

140
00:11:34.269 --> 00:11:36.429
Why wouldn't you want to marry me?

141
00:11:36.429 --> 00:11:40.500
Your mother told me that Elena was your fiance.

142
00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:46.419
I saw you and Elena in the bedroom together.

143
00:11:46.419 --> 00:11:50.669
I knew you had feelings for her.

144
00:11:50.669 --> 00:11:53.669
I've never slept with Elena. I've only ever been with you.

145
00:11:53.669 --> 00:12:01.129
But I saw the man in the bedroom. It was clearly you.

146
00:12:01.129 --> 00:12:04.129
I was planning your proposal at that time.

147
00:12:04.129 --> 00:12:05.419
See?

148
00:12:05.419 --> 00:12:13.379
You must have seen Victor. He likes to impersonate me.

149
00:12:13.379 --> 00:12:21.159
But in the sense of beginning, I always thought it was you.

150
00:12:21.159 --> 00:12:23.340
So...

151
00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:35.330
Mom, just say yes.
