00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,160
Seriously? Can't you even get this little thing done?

2
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,600
Sorry Vivian, I'm just tired from washing dishes a little bit.

3
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:34,539
Remember who got you this jaw, Frevisa? You'd be nothing without it.

4
00:00:34,539 --> 00:00:38,140
Vivian, remember it was my mom who paid for both our tuition.

5
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:42,299
She wanted us to study together, and have you helped me find my dad and brother.

6
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:47,340
Please, your dad ditched you and your mom because of some foreign flanging.

7
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,359
Get over it! How could you say that we're family?

8
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,560
No, no, no. Who are Lawrence? We are not family.

9
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:00,880
Your birth mom is dead. It's my aunt who adopted you.

10
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:08,459
What? Right! You hit your head and can't even remember anything.

11
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:14,140
You don't even know your dad's name. You tried to find him with some necklace?

12
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:21,939
Idiot! God, whatever. Now get out. You're fired.
