00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:06.820
Now get out you're fired. No, but you know my my visa is not without a visa

2
00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:10.660
You'll be sent back and have to leave your adoptive mom alone in the hospital

3
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.300
Not my problem, isn't it?

4
00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:16.179
Just go find some sugar daddy to help you out

5
00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.300
Hope I'm solved

6
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.300
Now get out

7
00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:38.020
Mom leaves it to me to find you guys

8
00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:53.409
Dad and brother will meet one day. Are you doing here? I'm a waitress here

9
00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.369
Miss Murphy is way more generous than you guys

10
00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:07.540
Miss Kerry Murphy. Yeah, she's my manager. There's no Miss Kerry Murphy

11
00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.540
That billboard it's just a code that the outreach reps use

12
00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:13.939
But um

13
00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:17.379
If you're looking for a sugar daddy, I can help you out with that

14
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.400
But if I make over first

15
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.400
Come on, baby. Come here with me

16
00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.980
We need to talk the dialogue and let the air situation today

17
00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:33.230
What's the rush? You know my condition

18
00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.189
I'm not able to have children unless

19
00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:39.099
We were to find his own daughter lore

20
00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:42.780
And then I could make her child my rightful heir

21
00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.900
That right. It's been 10 years since you last saw her

22
00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:47.359
Yes, well

23
00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:52.000
She hadn't saved my life 10 years ago that I would have never been adopted by the former leader

24
00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:56.239
And if the gangs hadn't attacked then I wouldn't have been separated from her in the first place

25
00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.719
So yes

26
00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:10.930
I will continue
