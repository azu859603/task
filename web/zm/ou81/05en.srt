00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
When's the old man come?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,059
It's my take a while.

3
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:06,099
Where's our waiter?

4
00:00:06,099 --> 00:00:08,099
Hey, can we get some drinks, please?

5
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:12,179
Thank you.

6
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:22,850
Cheers.

7
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:32,659
How long am I supposed to wait?

8
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:35,689
He texted he said he'd be here in just a little while.

9
00:00:35,689 --> 00:00:37,750
Are you sure you don't want to let go get some rest first?

10
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:43,240
What was in that drink?

11
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,460
I'm... I'm burning up.

12
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:47,460
It's just something to help you relax, all right?

13
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:52,420
Look, you've not seen Miss Lauren in, like, ten years.

14
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,420
You were having any errors.

15
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,420
I'm moving, thought maybe it'd be a good idea for you to try a few other options, you know?

16
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,420
Like, another word, and you'll never speak again.

17
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,710
You're fucking hands off me.

18
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:04,709
I'm not waiting any longer.

19
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:29,870
I did no hookers.

20
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:32,579
I'm not a hooker.

21
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:34,579
You don't matter.
