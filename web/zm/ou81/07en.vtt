00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.519
What? It's impossible.

2
00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:06.160
You know my condition?

3
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.320
Don Ryan, the doctor said it's unlikely,

4
00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.320
but it's not impossible.

5
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.199
You might have gotten lucky.

6
00:00:11.199 --> 00:00:13.560
Hey, what are you two wise guys talking about?

7
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:14.800
I'm Logan.

8
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.699
But a month ago, a woman named Lawrence Wilson

9
00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.440
hooked up with Don Ryan at the club.

10
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:22.280
Look at this.

11
00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.039
The timing checks out and everything.

12
00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:25.359
Who?

13
00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:30.030
Lord, I must be a blessed man.

14
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.929
Leaving the mob and becoming a real doctor.

15
00:00:33.929 --> 00:00:37.090
Ryan, congratulations.

16
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.049
You get to finally have an era of your own.

17
00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:42.060
I never said I would accept her.

18
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.380
She's a cold girl.

19
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.500
Who knows who's baby she's carrying?

20
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.859
Don't be a fucking asshole, Ryan.

21
00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:50.380
Our family doesn't abandon women.

22
00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.020
Even if there's a small chance, Ryan,

23
00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.659
we take responsibility for our actions.

24
00:00:56.659 --> 00:00:59.340
Just like with Lord and her mother,

25
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.899
how Lord asked me to take care of you.

26
00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:04.739
Don't let her down on this.

27
00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.760
Capiche?

28
00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.000
Fine.

29
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.810
I understand.

30
00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.900
Simon, I want you to look into her.

31
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.969
If she is playing with us, I want you to send her to Siberia.

32
00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:25.060
You got it?

33
00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:33.150
I won't quit looking for you, even if I do her a child.

34
00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.310
You bitch.

35
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.430
What are you doing?

36
00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.989
You ruined my boyfriend's business.

37
00:01:41.989 --> 00:01:44.590
You got him kicked out by Don Ryan.

38
00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.090
You gave this.

39
00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.709
You better think carefully about this.

40
00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:53.140
I'm Don Ryan's woman.

41
00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.739
You really think you've caught Don Ryan's eye?

42
00:01:56.739 --> 00:01:59.459
He's the top dog of the mob.

43
00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:01.219
But if you slept with him,

44
00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:04.439
he's just another notch on his belt.

45
00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.849
Get her.

46
00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:08.409
I'm pregnant with his baby.

47
00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:10.210
You expect us to buy that?

48
00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:12.530
Everyone knows that Don can't have kids.

49
00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.569
Don Ryan won't let anyone spread rumors about him.

50
00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:16.409
If you hurt me.

51
00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:19.020
You're really carrying his kid.

52
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.639
Where is he now?

53
00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:24.319
No one is buying your story.

54
00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:26.599
I'll call Don Ryan right now.

55
00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:30.479
Back off, and we can forget this ever happened.
