00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.270
Stop!

2
00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:02.270
Stop!

3
00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:06.459
Before I ship you off to the Red Light District, let's have some fun.

4
00:00:06.459 --> 00:00:07.459
It's all right.

5
00:00:07.459 --> 00:00:08.460
Don't run!

6
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.589
We'll let you get away with this!

7
00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:13.130
It's not dope.

8
00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:14.130
It's don't dangerous.

9
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.129
We don't have action on the dotted line.

10
00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:17.129
That's rich.

11
00:00:17.129 --> 00:00:20.129
If that's really his kid, then why is the answer your call?

12
00:00:20.129 --> 00:00:22.129
Please, please, please.

13
00:00:22.129 --> 00:00:23.129
What?

14
00:00:23.129 --> 00:00:25.129
You know, only two grand?

15
00:00:25.129 --> 00:00:29.149
Then again, you work for me, Simon.

16
00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:32.149
So why do you keep defending her and come to think of it?

17
00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:36.149
You're the one who brought her to my private room in the first place.

18
00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.539
Come on, I didn't do anything.

19
00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:39.539
I just, look.

20
00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:40.539
You work hard, okay?

21
00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:44.539
It's about time that you just kind of settle down with someone, all right?

22
00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:45.539
Yeah.

23
00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:51.539
She's just a nice girl who, I don't know, was looking for her visa, looking for some work, so I sent her up to a sweet eleven.

24
00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:52.539
That's all.

25
00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:53.539
Sweet eleven?

26
00:00:53.539 --> 00:01:00.229
Yeah.

27
00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:02.229
And she's only looking for a work visa.

28
00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:03.229
That's it.

29
00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:04.230
That's all.

30
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.989
Yeah.

31
00:01:06.989 --> 00:01:07.989
She's already called me twice.

32
00:01:07.989 --> 00:01:09.989
She loved the voicemail.

33
00:01:09.989 --> 00:01:10.989
Please.

34
00:01:10.989 --> 00:01:11.989
Please run.

35
00:01:11.989 --> 00:01:12.989
Please.

36
00:01:12.989 --> 00:01:15.019
She's in trouble.

37
00:01:15.019 --> 00:01:16.019
I need to save her.

38
00:01:16.019 --> 00:01:17.019
Let's go.

39
00:01:17.019 --> 00:01:18.019
Please, come.

40
00:01:18.019 --> 00:01:19.019
Give me that phone.

41
00:01:19.019 --> 00:01:20.019
Stupid bitch.

42
00:01:20.019 --> 00:01:23.019
Give me that bitch.

43
00:01:23.019 --> 00:01:24.019
My necklace.

44
00:01:24.019 --> 00:01:25.019
No.

45
00:01:25.019 --> 00:01:26.019
My necklace.

46
00:01:26.019 --> 00:01:28.909
I'll kill you.

47
00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:29.909
Stop right there.
