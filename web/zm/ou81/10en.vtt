00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:11.500
I'll kill you stop right there. I said get back

2
00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:15.599
The chain that you use on

3
00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.359
This one

4
00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:21.359
Simon, I want you to break every bone in his head

5
00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:24.359
I want you to dump this asshole in the woods

6
00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:33.619
You're welcome

7
00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.469
It's okay. I got you

8
00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:59.780
This scum bag out of you, come on

9
00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:10.659
This damn bitch

10
00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:12.689
was getting in my way

11
00:01:15.099 --> 00:01:17.640
Well, this out of fetch

12
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.640
a nice prize

13
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:32.579
Where am I?

14
00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.159
You're at one of my houses

15
00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.500
Don't worry

16
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.500
I had the best doctors look at you

17
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.500
The babies are both fine

18
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.900
You know?

19
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.900
I'm getting a DNA test tomorrow

20
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.000
If the babies are both mine

21
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.159
then we'll get married

22
00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:53.989
You're getting married?

23
00:01:53.989 --> 00:01:56.379
My soul's your visa problem, doesn't it?

24
00:01:56.379 --> 00:01:57.920
And don't worry

25
00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.920
Your mother was already set up in a private facility

26
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.920
receiving 24-hour professional care

27
00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.170
Let's try to get some rest, okay?

28
00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.449
Thank you

29
00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:11.669
How much do I owe you?

30
00:02:11.669 --> 00:02:14.219
I promise I'll find a way to pay you back

31
00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:16.789
You don't know me anything

32
00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:19.139
Don't worry about money

33
00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:20.139
Just don't ever lie to me

34
00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:26.909
Oh my god, my necklace

35
00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:27.909
The one I've had since childhood

36
00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:28.909
It's gone

37
00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:29.909
The necklace should have won too

38
00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:30.909
I need to find it

39
00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:31.909
Wait, my necklace is special?
