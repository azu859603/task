1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,960
I need to find it.

2
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:01,459
Wait a minute.

3
00:00:01,459 --> 00:00:01,960
Wait a minute.

4
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:02,960
Was it like special?

5
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:07,120
My mom, she gave it to me, said it was important, said that it would help me find another family.

6
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,119
Hey, hey.

7
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:09,660
I'll find it.

8
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:10,660
Okay.

9
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:13,650
Don't worry.

10
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:14,650
Look, at least you have a mom.

11
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:25,539
The Lord's in mind is, let's try and get some rest, okay?

12
00:00:25,539 --> 00:00:36,679
I'll look into the necklace.

13
00:00:36,679 --> 00:00:37,679
Welcome to the estate.

14
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:39,380
Oh my god.

15
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:42,429
Oh my god.

16
00:00:42,429 --> 00:00:45,649
This place is insane.

17
00:00:45,649 --> 00:00:50,240
It's absolutely unreal.

18
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:58,659
The room is right here to the left.

19
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:03,280
This bedroom is bigger than my whole apartment.

20
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:10,150
All this has been prepared, especially for you, by Don Ryan.

21
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:11,709
This could last me the whole pregnancy.

22
00:01:11,709 --> 00:01:15,540
Well, it's just a month.

23
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,379
He's also gotten you your personal nurse and a nutritionist.

24
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:21,640
They're going to customize your maternity plan.

25
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:25,329
You know, he's never brought home a woman before.

26
00:01:25,329 --> 00:01:53,280
I'll show you to your room.

27
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,439
What's this?

28
00:01:54,439 --> 00:02:01,000
I thought you might be hungry after work, made it myself, all natural ingredients.

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,799
Do the staff all quit or something?

30
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,430
Let me make something clear.

31
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:13,069
This estate has rules, whatever you're used to.

32
00:02:13,069 --> 00:02:15,479
Things work differently here.

33
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:17,800
That's what we have kitchen staff for.

34
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,629
Are you serious?

35
00:02:20,629 --> 00:02:24,379
Whatever.

36
00:02:24,379 --> 00:02:56,620
This tastes exactly how low I used to make it.

37
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:17,060
She even used to put them in leave, just like that.

38
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,500
Electricity bill is too high.

39
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:42,259
It's high.

40
00:03:42,259 --> 00:03:49,639
Why is it so hot in here, that the staff forget to turn on the AC?

41
00:03:49,719 --> 00:04:12,939
This room is so big, it takes forever just to get to the bathroom.

42
00:04:12,939 --> 00:04:28,699
What are you doing here?

43
00:04:28,699 --> 00:04:33,019
This is my room.

44
00:04:33,019 --> 00:04:34,019
You enjoying yourself?

45
00:04:34,019 --> 00:04:36,069
I...not bad.

46
00:04:36,069 --> 00:04:38,319
Are you done?

47
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,610
I know we've already umm...but...

48
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:45,819
Cut the crap.

49
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:46,819
This whole thing you planned this, didn't you?

50
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:47,819
What?

51
00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:49,779
Plan this?

52
00:04:49,779 --> 00:04:50,779
That's rich.

53
00:04:50,779 --> 00:04:51,779
Look who's enjoying it now.

54
00:04:51,779 --> 00:05:01,149
You can even see it through your towel.

55
00:05:01,149 --> 00:05:02,870
Don't press your luck.

56
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:06,269
This relationship is purely financial for the baby's sake.

57
00:05:06,269 --> 00:05:09,610
Nothing more.

58
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,850
You think I planned this pregnancy?

59
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:12,850
Who knows?

60
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:13,850
I want a DNA test.

61
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:20,449
You're doubting me.

62
00:05:20,449 --> 00:05:27,459
I have no idea you were such an arrogant, self-righteous jerk.

63
00:05:27,459 --> 00:05:29,540
If you have nothing to hide them, what's the problem?

64
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:30,540
You're the mother.

65
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,540
Yes.

66
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,540
I understand that.

67
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,939
How am I supposed to know that I'm the father?

68
00:05:33,939 --> 00:05:36,459
You cost me my career.

69
00:05:36,459 --> 00:05:37,459
And for what?

70
00:05:37,459 --> 00:05:40,860
I'll just pretend that that night was a bad dream.

71
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:43,209
I don't expect anything else for me.

72
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:47,980
What do you think you're going?

73
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,819
I'm moving out.

74
00:05:49,819 --> 00:05:52,819
I can raise this child on my own.

75
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:53,819
Stop right there.

76
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:54,819
Let go of me.

77
00:05:54,819 --> 00:05:57,259
Why are you being so damn difficult?

78
00:05:57,259 --> 00:06:01,430
Anyone would feel hurt because of some wild guess.

79
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:14,670
You're telling me you wouldn't feel angry if someone doubted your mother.

80
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:15,670
I'm sorry.

81
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:17,819
I was out of line.

82
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:22,620
The truth is, my mother and I went through the same exact thing.

83
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,660
I almost lost my adopted father because of those same doubts.

84
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:32,670
My sister, Laura, she was the one who convinced him to keep me.

85
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:34,600
Laura?

86
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,600
Sounds familiar.

87
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,379
I had hurts.

88
00:06:39,379 --> 00:07:03,949
I'll stay at the lakeside apartment tonight.

89
00:07:03,949 --> 00:07:06,889
You get some sleep here.

90
00:07:06,889 --> 00:07:09,449
I had the staff turn the AC on.

91
00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:12,129
You don't have to worry about utility bills anymore.

92
00:07:12,129 --> 00:07:13,129
Not while you're with me.

93
00:07:13,129 --> 00:07:18,100
And if you want to work, you can try our family jewelry studio.

94
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:36,529
I hear they're hiring.

95
00:07:36,529 --> 00:07:38,040
Stop.

96
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,579
I found her.

97
00:07:39,579 --> 00:07:40,579
Laura?

98
00:07:40,579 --> 00:07:41,970
You were right.

99
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:42,970
Okay, where is she?

100
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:47,389
She's at the flea market right now, and she's selling the necklace.

101
00:07:47,389 --> 00:07:49,310
Okay, that means that she's probably struggling.

102
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,509
Okay, take me to her now.

103
00:07:50,509 --> 00:07:59,310
I hope that for the rest of my life, all I see is her smile.

104
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,310
Let's go now.

105
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:23,839
Your name is Vivian.

106
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:29,259
I used to go by Laura, originally from Lillira.

107
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:37,139
It was a gift from your father, wasn't it?

108
00:08:37,139 --> 00:08:38,139
Who is she?

109
00:08:38,139 --> 00:08:39,139
The necklace?

110
00:08:39,139 --> 00:08:40,230
Damn it.

111
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:42,960
Did the witch read me out?

112
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:48,240
Yes, so what?

113
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,240
I'm Don Ryan.

114
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,190
Do you remember me?

115
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:53,190
Don't Ryan?

116
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:57,259
Ryan.

117
00:08:57,259 --> 00:08:59,159
Ryan.

118
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:00,159
See, don't Ryan?

119
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,159
Yes, yes.

120
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:02,159
You remember me.

121
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:03,639
I'm your stepbrother.

122
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:04,639
Oh my goodness.

123
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:06,720
The most loaded mob boss in the city.

124
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,440
How did Lauren get mixed up with him?

125
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,769
Don't be afraid.

126
00:09:12,769 --> 00:09:15,250
Your father and I have been looking for you forever.

127
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,700
Father?

128
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,700
Your birthfathered.

129
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,220
Don't you remember him?

130
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,779
Yes.

131
00:09:23,419 --> 00:09:28,299
Of course, I just lost some memories after everything that

132
00:09:28,299 --> 00:09:29,299
happened.

133
00:09:29,299 --> 00:09:31,940
I understand.

134
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:35,480
That night, 10 years ago, when you saved my life,

135
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:39,419
you must have been through hell since then.

136
00:09:39,419 --> 00:09:41,740
Come back to the estate with me.

137
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:47,039
Let me take care of you.

138
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:50,879
Or if you prefer your independence,

139
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:56,019
there's $5 million for a fresh start.

140
00:09:56,019 --> 00:09:59,850
Oh, million?

141
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:04,320
Oh, this is amazing.

142
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,320
Oh, my God.

143
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,919
No.

144
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:09,799
Why don't you come back to the apartment and think it over

145
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:12,080
for a few days?

146
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,720
Yes.

147
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,960
I would love that.

148
00:10:16,960 --> 00:11:06,299
I can't believe I found him.

149
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:11,539
So keep this going forever.

150
00:11:11,539 --> 00:11:16,919
She seems different from how you described.

151
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:18,360
Maybe we should do a DNA test.

152
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,690
It's enough.

153
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:21,129
She's been through hell these past 10 years.

154
00:11:21,129 --> 00:11:22,799
Can you imagine?

155
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:25,870
And also people can change.

156
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:30,059
Anyone would feel hurt because of some wild guess.

157
00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:31,059
Just give her some time.

158
00:11:31,059 --> 00:11:44,100
We'll figure out the past slowly.

159
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,100
Hello?

160
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,100
Fail cultural re-Italian, right?

161
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,100
Yeah.

162
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,100
It's all set.

163
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,100
They're expecting.

164
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:59,899
Got it done.

165
00:11:59,899 --> 00:12:01,980
I'm right by the door.

166
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:02,980
Oh, willing.

167
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:06,580
Sure, Mrs. Don receives our finest services.

168
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:12,220
Mm-hmm.

169
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:15,419
With Mrs. Don on board, we're going to be the talk of the

170
00:12:15,419 --> 00:12:21,960
town.

171
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,500
Hi.

172
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,500
Nice to meet you.

173
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,820
I'm...

174
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:26,820
Please move.

175
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:30,590
This isn't some window shopping territory.

176
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:33,139
Mrs. Don is coming.

177
00:12:33,139 --> 00:12:34,139
But I'm actually...

178
00:12:34,139 --> 00:12:35,139
Oh, my God.

179
00:12:35,139 --> 00:12:36,139
Oh, my God.

180
00:12:36,139 --> 00:12:41,769
You must be this Don.

181
00:12:41,769 --> 00:12:44,570
That design evive is unmistakable.

182
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:45,570
Please.

183
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:46,570
This way.

184
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:47,570
That's right.

185
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:48,570
I am Mrs. Don.

186
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:49,700
Whoa.

187
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,700
Whoa.

188
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,700
That's unfortunate.

189
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:59,429
This place is way out of your league.

190
00:12:59,429 --> 00:13:01,429
I'm a jewelry designer, remember?

191
00:13:01,429 --> 00:13:05,470
If it weren't for you, I would still have a job.

192
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:08,110
Back off, don't stung Mrs. Don's way.

193
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:11,879
Can I show you one of our latest pieces?

194
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:13,279
Seriously?

195
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:14,559
You have the wrong person.

196
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:16,480
I'm the one you should be meeting.

197
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,700
Please.

198
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,019
Mrs. Don knows quality.

199
00:13:20,019 --> 00:13:23,179
Look at her with her limited edition.

200
00:13:23,179 --> 00:13:24,179
Everything.

201
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:27,809
She's the real Mrs. Don.

202
00:13:27,809 --> 00:13:29,370
Look at you.

203
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:32,169
Where'd you even get the money for all of this?

204
00:13:32,169 --> 00:13:34,289
Like I need to explain myself to you.

205
00:13:34,289 --> 00:13:37,210
How dare you speak to Mrs. Don that way?

206
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:38,370
Security?

207
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:39,970
Get this checked out of here.

208
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:46,129
If you're the real Mrs. Don, then prove it.

209
00:13:46,129 --> 00:13:48,850
See this piece right here?

210
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:52,809
Let's see which one of us can actually drop the cash on it.

211
00:13:52,809 --> 00:14:01,470
I can make the transfer right now.

212
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:04,629
Will that actually get me some service around here?

213
00:14:04,629 --> 00:14:05,629
This one?

214
00:14:05,629 --> 00:14:06,629
Please.

215
00:14:06,629 --> 00:14:09,299
Give me some clearance merchandise.

216
00:14:09,299 --> 00:14:10,299
Exactly.

217
00:14:10,299 --> 00:14:16,419
Expecting VIP services for bargain bin prices dream on.

218
00:14:16,419 --> 00:14:18,539
Every customer deserves a respect.

219
00:14:18,539 --> 00:14:20,059
We don't judge by price tag here.

220
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:25,970
Is this how you treat our guests?

221
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:28,220
And who might you be?

222
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:31,659
Another one of her boy toys?

223
00:14:31,659 --> 00:14:34,820
Still playing your little games with man, I see.

224
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,909
I tell you what.

225
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:38,980
My role is simple.

226
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:43,159
The highs better, gets the best service.

227
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:50,460
This is Tom Abbott, the jury tycoon and our boss.

228
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,460
So what?

229
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:59,559
Well, lady, this is a one of peace, expensive, yes, but unique.

230
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:02,779
You would suit perfectly your elegance.

231
00:15:02,779 --> 00:15:04,379
I'll take it.

232
00:15:04,379 --> 00:15:06,580
Will that finally get me some service?

233
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,870
I'll pay double.

234
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:15,649
You'll never get the upper hand, bitch.

235
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:20,289
This one is our showpiece, one of a kind.

236
00:15:20,289 --> 00:15:21,490
This one's nice, too.

237
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:25,519
I'll take them all.

238
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:26,519
Double price.

239
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:33,090
You know what's final sale on all luxury items once they leave the counter?

240
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:35,409
Did you actually swipe your card for any of these?

241
00:15:35,409 --> 00:15:38,610
And the total comes out to 2.8 million.

242
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:40,730
What?

243
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:42,860
You know what?

244
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:43,860
Hmm.

245
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:49,629
Nothing really catches my eye here, but congrats on your haul, though none of it really suits

246
00:15:49,629 --> 00:15:51,529
you.

247
00:15:51,529 --> 00:15:57,490
Well, bring the card reader for VIP guests.

248
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:58,490
You?

249
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:03,419
You haven't paid yet.

250
00:16:03,419 --> 00:16:05,259
Back off, Miss Vivian.

251
00:16:05,259 --> 00:16:14,500
May I have a word?

252
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,860
Wait, you know me?

253
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:18,019
No, it's been a while.

254
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:21,629
College was great that you didn't have forgotten me.

255
00:16:21,629 --> 00:16:22,629
From college.

256
00:16:22,629 --> 00:16:23,730
Tom Abbott.

257
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:24,860
Oh my god.

258
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:25,860
Hi.

259
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,860
I'll be looking for you.

260
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,779
Looking for me?

261
00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:31,779
Why?

262
00:16:31,779 --> 00:16:35,059
I just wanted to know how you were doing.

263
00:16:35,059 --> 00:16:37,809
You know, he saw the show in there.

264
00:16:37,809 --> 00:16:40,580
That's my cousin Vivian.

265
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:44,019
She'll do pretty much anything to ruin my life.

266
00:16:44,019 --> 00:16:45,620
Although she is good for business.

267
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:46,620
You're right.

268
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:49,659
Well, we hit quite a sell because of you today.

269
00:16:49,659 --> 00:16:52,659
According to the rules, you're up for 700k bonus.

270
00:16:52,659 --> 00:16:54,580
Oh, you can keep it.

271
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,379
Give it to Vivian.

272
00:16:56,379 --> 00:16:59,169
She's the one who made it happen anyways.

273
00:16:59,169 --> 00:17:05,930
You played me.

274
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:06,930
Here.

275
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:07,930
That's more gifts.

276
00:17:08,009 --> 00:17:11,890
What?

277
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:14,240
This is stunning.

278
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,759
The design is incredible.

279
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:16,759
I designed it myself.

280
00:17:16,759 --> 00:17:44,660
I didn't even love it.

281
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:45,660
Wait, Tom.

282
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,660
I can't accept this.

283
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:48,660
Oh, come on.

284
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:49,660
You won't accept the bonus nowadays.

285
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,660
It's not even pressing.

286
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:55,059
It's just, I had a necklace that I lost recently.

287
00:17:55,059 --> 00:17:57,539
An important one.

288
00:17:57,539 --> 00:17:59,700
Then wear this until you find it.

289
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,700
Come on.

290
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,539
They'll tell me you don't like my design.

291
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:04,339
Let me help you.

292
00:18:04,339 --> 00:18:16,119
What's going on?

293
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:17,119
I thought we were meeting Lauren.

294
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:18,119
I said drive.

295
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:29,180
No, I can do it myself.

296
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,940
Was that Ryan's car?

297
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:33,579
I wanted to ask him about the missing necklace.

298
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:35,140
I found what's going on.

299
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:37,460
I centered there to work.

300
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,180
I'll flirt with the owner.

301
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:41,420
Look, maybe there's just some kind of like missing

302
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:44,750
or standing or something like that.

303
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:45,750
All right.

304
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:53,170
I'm very busy.

305
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:55,930
There is a private jewelry salon tomorrow.

306
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:58,700
Top designers from all around the world.

307
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:02,849
It's exclusive, but I can make an exception for you.

308
00:19:02,849 --> 00:19:04,380
Really?

309
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,579
This is a huge opportunity.

310
00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:08,019
Let's see you tomorrow then.

311
00:19:08,019 --> 00:19:18,880
You bitch.

312
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,420
You pushed me to this.

313
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:42,299
I won't let you win.

314
00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:43,140
Come here.

315
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:49,259
I've been working on something for your family.

316
00:19:49,259 --> 00:19:51,339
You enjoy yourself today?

317
00:19:51,339 --> 00:19:52,140
It was fine.

318
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:54,849
Just a small hiccup.

319
00:19:54,849 --> 00:19:56,210
I'd like to work there if they

320
00:19:56,210 --> 00:20:01,579
replace that store manager.

321
00:20:01,579 --> 00:20:03,509
It's a nice piece.

322
00:20:03,509 --> 00:20:06,200
Is that the one you've been looking for?

323
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,000
Oh, this?

324
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,799
No, of course not.

325
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,039
The owner is actually my college classmate.

326
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:12,279
He designed it.

327
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:16,619
By the way, any news about my necklace?

328
00:20:16,619 --> 00:20:18,900
Seems like you're enjoying that one plenty.

329
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,660
You sure you need another one?

330
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:21,660
What do you mean?

331
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:24,970
Small gift, big implications.

332
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:26,410
Seems like the manager isn't the only one

333
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:27,930
you're trying to replace.

334
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:30,880
He's just a college classmate.

335
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,960
And besides, his design inspired me.

336
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,319
Look, I just created this new crust for your family.

337
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:39,240
That's your business, not mine.

338
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,920
Just don't tarnish my family name.

339
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,329
Are you doubting me?

340
00:20:44,329 --> 00:20:46,849
I've been faithful to this marriage.

341
00:20:46,849 --> 00:20:48,529
I thought you'd trust me that much.

342
00:20:48,529 --> 00:20:50,369
Trust comes with proof.

343
00:20:50,369 --> 00:20:55,380
I trust what I see.

344
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,450
Fine.

345
00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:01,829
Even if you don't trust me, trust the mother's heart.

346
00:21:01,829 --> 00:21:04,559
For my baby, I'll be a good mother and wife.

347
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:05,680
Damn.

348
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,460
Is she saying this for the child?

349
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:09,680
Good.

350
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,200
And I'll do my part as a husband and a father.

351
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,789
But don't expect anything else.

352
00:21:14,789 --> 00:21:16,819
Don't worry about me.

353
00:21:16,819 --> 00:21:25,289
Don't worry about being a good father.

354
00:21:25,289 --> 00:21:26,210
What?

355
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:28,829
Don, Miss Vivian is injured.

356
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:29,829
Call the family doctor.

357
00:21:29,829 --> 00:21:30,589
I'll be there.

358
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:33,730
I'll be there right now.

359
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:35,710
Wait.

360
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:37,150
You said you'd look for my necklace.

361
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:37,869
I drew it here.

362
00:21:37,869 --> 00:21:40,380
Can you just look on the way?

363
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:55,819
Some other time.

364
00:21:55,819 --> 00:21:57,380
That hurts.

365
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:58,180
Oh, come on.

366
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:59,299
There are just scratches.

367
00:21:59,299 --> 00:22:01,859
Nothing major.

368
00:22:01,859 --> 00:22:04,500
I got shoved at a jewelry store.

369
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,259
She tried to grab everything I wanted.

370
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:08,140
Who did this?

371
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,779
Give me a name.

372
00:22:09,779 --> 00:22:11,569
I forget it.

373
00:22:11,569 --> 00:22:15,930
Can't exactly start a war with my cousin, can I?

374
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:17,869
Why would she do something like that?

375
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:19,920
Classical hurry, you know?

376
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,119
Hooks up with random guys.

377
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:25,269
Try to steal my necklace.

378
00:22:25,269 --> 00:22:28,950
Maybe I should just stay away from her.

379
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:32,910
Maybe you should stick around and get me safe.

380
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:33,829
Come on.

381
00:22:33,829 --> 00:22:34,190
You're free.

382
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:36,609
You're stressed like that.

383
00:22:36,609 --> 00:23:12,930
I mean, I just feel like I'm losing my mind.

384
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:14,809
You know, I know Lord might be trouble,

385
00:23:14,809 --> 00:23:18,549
but I just, I can't bring myself to do anything about it.

386
00:23:18,549 --> 00:23:20,390
I even had the instinct that maybe Vivian

387
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:22,589
was already sold a necklace in the first place.

388
00:23:22,589 --> 00:23:23,750
You're not losing your mind.

389
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:26,029
I was thinking the exact same thing.

390
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:31,529
And it has to help Vivian.

391
00:23:31,529 --> 00:23:34,660
Once we know that she is my sister, for sure,

392
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:35,660
then I'll deal with Lord.

393
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:40,460
In the meantime, just keep an eye on my place

394
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:48,349
for advancing your jewelry salon tomorrow.

395
00:23:48,349 --> 00:23:55,460
You would take Miss Vivian's mind out, thanks.

396
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,819
My mother's birthday is coming soon.

397
00:23:57,819 --> 00:24:00,220
Can you help me find the perfect gift?

398
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:03,829
Women's perspective must be better than mine, I guess.

399
00:24:03,829 --> 00:24:08,950
Of course.

400
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:11,069
This one is perfect.

401
00:24:11,069 --> 00:24:14,190
It's classic, but still stylish.

402
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:17,549
And it's a beautiful mix of vintage and modern touches.

403
00:24:17,549 --> 00:24:19,619
Exactly her style.

404
00:24:19,619 --> 00:24:20,819
Wow.

405
00:24:20,819 --> 00:24:25,150
After all these years, we still think I like.

406
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:29,529
I'll take it.

407
00:24:29,529 --> 00:24:34,299
Mr. Tom Abbott, what an honor to have you here.

408
00:24:34,299 --> 00:24:35,460
And you are?

409
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,339
An old college friend of mine.

410
00:24:37,339 --> 00:24:39,099
Excellent jewelry designer, actually.

411
00:24:39,099 --> 00:24:42,819
She will be joining my team very soon.

412
00:24:42,819 --> 00:24:47,140
This is Cecile, the owner and the host of this whole designer

413
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:48,819
in the business.

414
00:24:48,819 --> 00:24:51,710
You're the famous Cecile.

415
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:54,150
It's a pleasure to meet you.

416
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:55,029
Well, just wait.

417
00:24:55,029 --> 00:24:58,509
We have an even bigger surprise guest coming.

418
00:24:58,509 --> 00:25:01,150
Go check if Don Ryan has arrived.

419
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:31,319
What are you doing here?

420
00:25:31,319 --> 00:25:35,400
I see the two of you know each other.

421
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,480
Well, that's less work for me then.

422
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:38,680
I'll leave you to it.

423
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,599
Excuse me.

424
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:44,730
With him?

425
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:46,410
Seriously.

426
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:49,170
You know, I knew there was someone else, but Vivian?

427
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:49,930
Really?

428
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:50,730
No, she's not.

429
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:52,490
She's just mine.

430
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:53,769
You OK?

431
00:25:53,769 --> 00:25:56,579
Yes, just dizzy.

432
00:25:56,579 --> 00:26:00,299
Ryan, I left my nausea pills in the car.

433
00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:11,170
Could you please grab them from me?

434
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:12,170
So really in there.

435
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:13,690
Here, let me help me clean up.

436
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:15,170
Don't touch me.

437
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:30,200
I can do it myself.

438
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:44,619
Bitch, I'll ruin you completely.

439
00:26:44,619 --> 00:26:45,740
It's all for the baby.

440
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:57,619
Remember, who he's in love with isn't your business.

441
00:26:57,619 --> 00:27:01,420
All right, are you OK?

442
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:04,220
Ryan, what are you doing?

443
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:07,420
She's my fiance.

444
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:09,539
You care to explain what your college friend is doing here

445
00:27:09,539 --> 00:27:10,460
with you?

446
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:13,259
Is that all you want to talk about?

447
00:27:13,259 --> 00:27:16,180
What night do you have to even question me?

448
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:17,900
What's that supposed to mean?

449
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:21,900
You have someone, and then you still come after me,

450
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:24,140
and then you want to question me, too.

451
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:26,059
You mean Vivian?

452
00:27:26,059 --> 00:27:28,799
Lauren, she's my...

453
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:31,750
Miss Lauren, is this your purse?

454
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:34,200
Yes.

455
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,059
We found the stolen items inside.

456
00:27:37,059 --> 00:27:38,380
You'll need to come with us.

457
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:38,859
What?

458
00:27:38,859 --> 00:27:39,859
No, stop.

459
00:27:39,859 --> 00:27:40,700
That's impossible.

460
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,980
Wait, wait, hold on.

461
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:42,940
No.

462
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:43,660
Hey, what are you doing?

463
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:44,460
Hey.

464
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:49,970
Ryan, Ryan.

465
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:51,130
Vivian, Lauren's in trouble.

466
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:52,170
I need to go and save her.

467
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:52,970
Don't.

468
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:54,369
Trust me on this one.

469
00:27:54,369 --> 00:27:57,740
No, my cousin, better than anyone else.

470
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:00,099
She's always had sticky fingers.

471
00:28:00,099 --> 00:28:00,819
It's impossible.

472
00:28:00,819 --> 00:28:02,420
She's been with me the entire time.

473
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:03,859
She couldn't have done this.

474
00:28:03,859 --> 00:28:06,119
Let me handle this, okay?

475
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:07,599
Trust me.

476
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:09,319
Stay here.

477
00:28:09,319 --> 00:28:17,059
I know how to fix this.

478
00:28:17,059 --> 00:28:18,099
So I'm trying to listen to you, Vivian,

479
00:28:18,099 --> 00:28:20,259
so you can just take her.

480
00:28:20,259 --> 00:28:23,859
Mr. Abbott, this event is invitation only

481
00:28:23,859 --> 00:28:26,180
for our most esteemed guests.

482
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:28,990
We never expected, look,

483
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:30,309
we have to take her to the police.

484
00:28:30,309 --> 00:28:32,609
Don't make this any more difficult.

485
00:28:32,609 --> 00:28:34,369
I didn't do any of that.

486
00:28:34,369 --> 00:28:36,089
I didn't steal anything.

487
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:38,329
I haven't even seen whatever it is.

488
00:28:38,329 --> 00:28:39,769
Look, I know her.

489
00:28:39,769 --> 00:28:40,930
She wouldn't do this.

490
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:42,450
That must be a mistake.

491
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:46,220
Mine going easy on this one for my sake.

492
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:49,500
Lauren, you've been stealing since we were kids.

493
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,369
But here?

494
00:28:51,369 --> 00:28:51,970
Really?

495
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:55,779
What are you talking about?

496
00:28:55,779 --> 00:28:58,579
Ms. Vivian, you're really close with Don Ryan.

497
00:28:58,579 --> 00:29:08,660
Do you have any suggestions?

498
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:10,259
Where is that DNA report?

499
00:29:10,339 --> 00:29:11,500
Any minute and I'm done.

500
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,619
Five minutes.

501
00:29:12,619 --> 00:29:15,049
I need those results.

502
00:29:15,049 --> 00:29:18,089
Well, since you found the item,

503
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:19,730
let's handle this quietly.

504
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:26,759
I'll compensate for my dear cousin's mistake.

505
00:29:26,759 --> 00:29:28,480
No police.

506
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,740
Better for anyone, isn't it?

507
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,299
Compensation?

508
00:29:32,299 --> 00:29:33,259
Really?

509
00:29:33,259 --> 00:29:36,059
You're making it seem like I actually stole it.

510
00:29:36,059 --> 00:29:38,259
I didn't steal anything.

511
00:29:38,259 --> 00:29:40,140
And I don't need your help.

512
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:43,660
Don't you self-lucky or things get much worse.

513
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:46,700
I'd rather face the police than accept your help.

514
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,190
Fine.

515
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:50,349
But that's your choice.

516
00:29:50,349 --> 00:29:54,589
Remember, once in there, good luck getting out.

517
00:29:54,589 --> 00:29:55,829
The four minutes gone.

518
00:29:55,829 --> 00:29:56,670
Where is it?

519
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:57,829
I'll call them.

520
00:29:57,829 --> 00:30:00,940
Hey, I need to know which one.

521
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:08,819
Which one is really my sister?

522
00:30:08,819 --> 00:30:13,059
Take your hands on my fiancé now.

523
00:30:13,059 --> 00:30:20,039
Look, I just got the DNA test results back.

524
00:30:20,039 --> 00:30:24,200
This Vivian is Don Logan's flesh of blood.

525
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:31,299
Your stepsister.

526
00:30:31,299 --> 00:30:33,099
That doesn't make any sense.

527
00:30:33,099 --> 00:30:36,099
Vivian, what are you hiding?

528
00:30:36,099 --> 00:30:37,859
Keep your nose out of it.

529
00:30:37,859 --> 00:30:39,619
This is family business.

530
00:30:39,619 --> 00:30:40,779
It's enough, Vivian.

531
00:30:40,779 --> 00:30:48,220
This isn't the time or the place.

532
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,380
Who's that?

533
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,180
He stole it.

534
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:56,079
Find him now.

535
00:30:56,079 --> 00:31:02,869
What?

536
00:31:02,869 --> 00:31:07,900
I'd love to be with our baby.

537
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:08,460
They will.

538
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:11,869
Wild?

539
00:31:11,869 --> 00:31:14,440
That she'd get everything.

540
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:17,210
Can you take care of her?

541
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:18,690
Back off.

542
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:34,460
Unless you want this getting ugly between our families.

543
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,349
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

544
00:31:36,349 --> 00:31:37,549
I spoke with your doctor.

545
00:31:37,549 --> 00:31:38,829
He said you're fine.

546
00:31:38,829 --> 00:31:40,690
And the babies are as well.

547
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,690
But you need to rest, OK?

548
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:45,750
It can handle on me.

549
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:47,549
Doctor's orders.

550
00:31:47,549 --> 00:31:50,430
This position, my body heat up against yours,

551
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:52,869
is the best way for you to relax.

552
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:55,190
Trust me, if it weren't for the babies,

553
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:59,559
you wouldn't be getting this special treatment.

554
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:04,180
Funny, come without a DNA test, you trust me.

555
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:07,059
Yeah, well, even you wouldn't lie to God

556
00:32:07,059 --> 00:32:09,170
in a moment like that.

557
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:14,579
Who do you?

558
00:32:14,579 --> 00:32:16,339
Vivian is my sister.

559
00:32:16,339 --> 00:32:18,220
If you don't like her, that's fine.

560
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:20,579
But I need you to avoid her.

561
00:32:20,579 --> 00:32:24,059
And quit picking fights with her.

562
00:32:24,059 --> 00:32:26,740
You think I'm the one who started this?

563
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:28,839
I know that she hurt you.

564
00:32:28,839 --> 00:32:31,039
And I know that she is a temper.

565
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:32,940
But she saved my life.

566
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:36,460
I owe her.

567
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:37,759
You'll see.

568
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:55,460
I'll prove to you the kind of person she will lose.

569
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:58,849
Champion rosewater.

570
00:32:58,849 --> 00:33:00,130
How could you?

571
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:22,559
Great job by the jewelry show and the DNA swap.

572
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:28,160
Ryan trusts me completely now.

573
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:32,029
But we can't keep that bitch anymore.

574
00:33:32,029 --> 00:33:36,230
If I can't get to Ryan, this little princess will have to do.

575
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:38,920
The real Dawn heiress, huh?

576
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,000
She's carrying his baby.

577
00:33:41,000 --> 00:34:22,659
As long as she's around, we're at risk of exposure.

578
00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:26,139
All right, so Dawn, it's Mrs. Abbott's birthday tomorrow evening.

579
00:34:26,139 --> 00:34:27,460
You gonna be attending?

580
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:28,809
Of course.

581
00:34:28,889 --> 00:34:30,329
She's got poor in politics.

582
00:34:30,329 --> 00:34:32,210
I can't ignore that.

583
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:36,530
Besides, it's time for Vivian to start making the rounds anyway.

584
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:39,969
What about Mrs. Lauren?

585
00:34:39,969 --> 00:34:42,369
Have something even bigger planned for her debut.
