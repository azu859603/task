00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:04.519
She attacked me! She tried to steal my necklace!

2
00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:07.519
What? No, I just wanted to take a look.

3
00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:08.519
What happened? You heard?

4
00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.259
Just scratches. Nothing.

5
00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:14.259
Drop the act. I never touched your neck.

6
00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:17.449
You did for her. Just apologize, please.

7
00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:18.449
What?

8
00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.449
I know you didn't mean to, but look at what you did.

9
00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:24.449
I didn't do it. Why won't you believe me?

10
00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.579
You did. Be grateful. I haven't made you back for forgiveness.

11
00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:30.579
That's enough, Lydia.

12
00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:32.770
Mrs. Abbott has arrived.

13
00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.770
Both of you go and get dressed. The party's about to start.
