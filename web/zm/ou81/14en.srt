00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:06,379
Mrs. Abbott, I had this blue diamond custom made for you.

2
00:00:06,379 --> 00:00:08,060
It's one of a kind.

3
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:13,009
Only a woman of your refinement deserves such a piece.

4
00:00:13,009 --> 00:00:15,710
You must be the Don Eris.

5
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:17,109
It's exquisite.

6
00:00:17,109 --> 00:00:18,449
Thank you.

7
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:23,550
I love it.

8
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:39,020
And this lovely lady is your...

9
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:43,799
Mrs. Abbott, may I present you my fiancÃ©?

10
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:45,899
Happy birthday, Mrs. Abbott.

11
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:48,340
I heard you have an appreciation for Eastern culture,

12
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,340
so I got you something special.

13
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:52,340
Wait.

14
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:53,539
Scrap is that.

15
00:00:53,539 --> 00:00:56,539
How can you bring such a thing to Mrs. Abbott?

16
00:00:56,539 --> 00:00:59,240
Vivian, mind your manners.

17
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,840
Yes.

18
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,659
Who even knows what this is?

19
00:01:03,659 --> 00:01:05,260
A piece of paper?

20
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:06,560
Where's the penny?

21
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,150
Is this how you'd tip a beggar?

22
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,950
What could I even expect from you, Vivian?

23
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:15,349
You don't read any books, nor do you have any taste.

24
00:01:15,349 --> 00:01:16,650
Now, let go.

25
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:17,849
You better let go.

26
00:01:17,849 --> 00:01:32,700
Get your grabby hands away from me.

27
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,079
I mean, work.

28
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:38,719
The cultural arts master.

29
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:44,359
It's no money can buy such a piece.

30
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:46,359
Truly thankful.

31
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:48,359
I couldn't ask for a better gift.
