00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Ugh, truly thankful. I couldn't ask for a better gift. Mrs. Don.

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Thank you so much.

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
How did you get this? How did you wish to get this piece?

4
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I treated Master Irene before. She created this piece as a gesture of appreciation.

5
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Hey Vivian!

6
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
You couldn't even get work, Lisa.

7
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
How could you possibly know Master Irene?

8
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.289
Mrs. Abbott!

9
00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.449
Don't let her fool you!

10
00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.450
Those few brush strokes?

11
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.450
It's probably fake. Or stolen. Maybe even from some street vendor.

12
00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:39.450
That's enough.

13
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.609
Vivian, you need to cool off. Let's go now.

14
00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:49.609
I am not living. I'm just trying to kick Mrs. Abbott from being tricked.

15
00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:55.609
Look closer. That's Master Irene's unique seal. It can't be replicated.

16
00:00:55.609 --> 00:01:00.270
Ryan, handle this.

17
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.270
Mrs. Abbott, I apologize.

18
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:10.269
My sister has been lost for ten years and she just needs some time to readjust to our standards. We're leaving now.

19
00:01:10.269 --> 00:01:16.909
Standards? She likes basic human decency. Here's how she framed Lauren. Now where it was for her.

20
00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:17.909
You've been following me?

21
00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.909
Following on my family's property? I'd call it surveillance.
