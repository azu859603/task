1
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:07,830
Can I have it?

2
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:18,339
I can do it myself.

3
00:00:18,339 --> 00:00:22,440
Look, it really didn't save my life.

4
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:26,039
She gave me her blood and she convinced my stepfather to keep me.

5
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:29,519
I promised that I would always protect her.

6
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:37,719
What's wrong?

7
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:38,719
Okay.

8
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:39,719
You okay?

9
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:40,780
Just stop.

10
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:49,530
I never asked for your love, but you can't even show me basic compassion.

11
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:53,789
You'll never be a good father, calling off the wedding.

12
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:54,789
What did you just say?

13
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:57,270
I'm not marrying you.

14
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:59,109
Once I find a place I'm leaving.

15
00:00:59,109 --> 00:01:00,590
Don't push me, Lauren.

16
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:04,500
I have you chances.

17
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,500
Is this really what you want?

18
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,340
To leave me?
