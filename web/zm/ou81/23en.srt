1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:05,309
Vivian, we need to talk.

2
00:00:05,309 --> 00:00:09,400
What is it?

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,699
You care to explain what happened the other day?

4
00:00:11,699 --> 00:00:13,099
What do you want to hear?

5
00:00:13,099 --> 00:00:14,500
I don't understand.

6
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,300
Why frame Lawrence?

7
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:17,699
And who is the guy?

8
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:19,199
You know why?

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:20,800
I love you.

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,500
And I know you love me too.

11
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,100
Jesus Christ, Vivian, for God's sakes,

12
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,600
you're like a sister to me, nothing more.

13
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,300
Yes, I am grateful that you saved my life all those years ago.

14
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,600
I will forever be grateful for that.

15
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,200
But you've got to stop this, okay?

16
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,299
You have to.

17
00:00:35,299 --> 00:00:36,799
It is because of her, isn't it?

18
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:38,600
No, this has nothing to do with Lawrence.

19
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,060
This has everything to do with your attitude.

20
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:44,159
And I'm sorry, but you just can't stay here.

21
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:45,759
It is her.

22
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:47,960
I will never forgive that bitch.

23
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:51,820
Enough!

24
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:55,960
Damn it!

25
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:56,960
What?

26
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,259
Don't.

27
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:01,259
The man with Vivian was Jacob.

28
00:01:01,259 --> 00:01:03,549
But he's gone underground.

29
00:01:03,549 --> 00:01:05,780
You're kidding me.

30
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:07,579
Okay, well don't say anything to Vivian.

31
00:01:07,579 --> 00:01:09,180
Bring him to me.

32
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,780
I want answers personally.
