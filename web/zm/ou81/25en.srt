1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:02,020
Oh, there was an old man here.

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:06,000
An old man?

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I haven't seen any old men.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,380
Are you sure you're feeling okay?

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,990
Never mind.

6
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:15,089
What do you want?

7
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:17,089
You're never home anymore.

8
00:00:17,089 --> 00:00:19,089
Using my house like a hotel.

9
00:00:19,089 --> 00:00:21,089
I'm busy.

10
00:00:21,089 --> 00:00:24,370
Is that your answer to every problem?

11
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:27,370
Is there a vaccine trying to fix things?

12
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:29,660
What is there to fix, Ryan?

13
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:30,660
Me?

14
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,659
Or your dear sister?

15
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:34,659
He was her around.

16
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:38,000
Nothing changes.

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
He always picked her over me.

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,060
Or.

19
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,060
See?

20
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:45,060
Nothing changes.

21
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:49,200
Don't riot.

22
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,200
I've been waiting for this.

23
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,200
Come on. Let's see how all my face pairs with your face, huh?

24
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,200
Guys!

25
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,200
Stop it!
