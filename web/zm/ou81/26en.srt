1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:02,049
Come on, come on, stop it!

2
00:00:03,049 --> 00:00:04,049
You're not welcome here.

3
00:00:05,049 --> 00:00:06,049
Will I hate you too hard?

4
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:09,050
Don't forget, I will stay here too.

5
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,050
Fine, I'm pulling out.

6
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:13,050
My family is done with you.

7
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:16,050
Lauren, I have another student near my place.

8
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:20,050
If you want to work there or leave there, just say the word and you have the job.

9
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:22,050
You don't get to make decisions for my fiance.

10
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,050
She's carrying my child.

11
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:27,050
And the dawns is in some company that needs saving.

12
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:29,050
So now is your child, huh?

13
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:31,050
I thought you had some doubts about that.

14
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:32,049
You know what?

15
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:33,049
I don't care.

16
00:00:33,049 --> 00:00:35,049
As long as it's Lauren's child.

17
00:00:35,049 --> 00:00:37,049
No DNA test, no questioning.

18
00:00:37,049 --> 00:00:38,049
Ryan, please.

19
00:00:38,049 --> 00:00:41,049
You know there's nothing left between us.

20
00:00:41,049 --> 00:00:42,049
Just let me go.

21
00:00:42,049 --> 00:00:43,210
Okay?

22
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,369
Don't push me.

23
00:00:45,369 --> 00:00:47,369
I won't push you.

24
00:00:47,369 --> 00:00:50,390
But don't forget, Lauren.

25
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:53,390
You're the one who promised to stick around for the baby's sake.

26
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:55,390
I won't be there for my child.

27
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:57,710
But I'm done.

28
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:14,909
Being your trophy wife.

29
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:18,000
I meant what I said in there.

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,349
Let me take care of both of you.

31
00:01:20,349 --> 00:01:22,579
I'm not like him.

32
00:01:22,579 --> 00:01:23,579
Let me help.
