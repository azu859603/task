1
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:07,530
No, Tom. I can't.

2
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:16,170
I'm sorry. You've been so good to me.

3
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:20,170
It's all right. I get it. It's hard I didn't go.

4
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:36,539
What is it?

5
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:38,539
We've got a situation at the studio.

6
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:39,539
Okay, what happened?

7
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:43,539
Client files that Mrs. Dom was in charge with have been leaked. They're lawyering up.

8
00:00:43,539 --> 00:00:45,539
Okay, where is Laura? Is she okay?

9
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:47,539
She went down there to handle herself and they were just there.

10
00:00:47,539 --> 00:00:50,020
Why would she go down there by herself?

11
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:53,530
Okay. I'll wait to bring the car around.

12
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:55,530
I'm all in her faces on her own.

13
00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:04,640
You know the Don name used to mean something.

14
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,640
And now look, all my private information's all over the market.

15
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,640
What are you gonna do to fix this, huh?

16
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,640
I swear I kept everything locked up.

17
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,640
I don't know how it got swapped out.

18
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,900
I promise.

19
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,900
However you want to handle this, I'll cooperate.

20
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,900
I'm filing a lawsuit.

21
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,900
Now what the entire Don Brand blacklisted.

22
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,120
You understand?

23
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:29,120
Please, just, it's my fault. I'll take responsibility.

24
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:34,120
No, this is my family's business. I'll take full responsibility.
