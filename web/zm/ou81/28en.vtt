00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.500
Why does she always look so familiar?

2
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.500
Don, I respect your family name.

3
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.500
But this crosses every line in the book.

4
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.500
This isn't how we do business.

5
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.500
Someone is trying to smear my family's name.

6
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.500
Now she's not involved anymore. She resigned.

7
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.500
Let her go.

8
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.500
No, no, no. She's responsible.

9
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.500
How do we know she didn't do it on purpose?

10
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.500
Let me make myself crystal clear.

11
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.500
She is my fiance.

12
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.500
Do you think she would smear my name?

13
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.500
Just give me time and I will figure it out, okay?

14
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.500
Maybe you should start with your own household on.

15
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.500
You again?

16
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.500
Did I not teach you enough of a lesson the other day?

17
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.500
This isn't your business.

18
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.500
Anything that involves Laurent is my business.

19
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.500
Besides, I think we have quite a story here.

20
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.500
What are you implying?

21
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.500
My eyes works better than yours.

22
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.500
This was obviously aimed at Laurent.

23
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.500
And I think we both know who wants to hurt her.

24
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.500
If you're suggesting Vivian, there's no way.

25
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.500
She would never risk sabotaging my family's name.

26
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.500
Of course. What did I expect?

27
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.500
We'll see. I guess we will.
