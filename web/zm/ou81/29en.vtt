1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.859
Please, Vivian. Don't fail me.

2
00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:08.300
Hey, was Vivian?

3
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.810
Don, you better hear from them.

4
00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:19.780
Tell me everything, or I will make sure that nobody ever finds what's left of you.

5
00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:23.780
Mercy done. She gave me 100 bucks. I bet.

6
00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.780
You switched the files. I didn't know it was your territory.

7
00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.960
Why did you frame my feelings, eh?

8
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.960
Well, don't rhyme. It wasn't me. It was Miss Vivian.

9
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.960
You better know what you were saying if you were framed by my sister.

10
00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.960
And you know what will happen.

11
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.960
I won't. Miss Vivian, she fired me when she fought Mrs. Dawn.

12
00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.960
Said I could get some revenge. I had no idea. Lorne, was your feel say.

13
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.060
Dammit. Tell us her again.

14
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.369
Talk to me.

15
00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:57.619
Who's wrong?

16
00:00:57.619 --> 00:01:00.619
I'm dammit, Vivian. I warned you to stop. Why now?

17
00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:03.619
The bitch took what's mine. I warned Hallet.

18
00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:07.620
And you've risked the family reputation over this? What exactly did she take?

19
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:13.750
Look. You are my baby sister, okay? And I love you. I've always defended you.

20
00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.750
Dawn, I nearly drove her away for you.

21
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.750
Why her? Why not me?

22
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.069
I think it's time that I finally find you husband.

23
00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:23.069
What?

24
00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:27.069
Yeah. I'm willing to let this slide, but you can't stay here anymore.

25
00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:32.099
And I will set you up with someone good. Not our level, but you'll be comfortable.

26
00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:35.099
No way. How could you push me into something like this?

27
00:01:35.099 --> 00:01:40.099
I'm done, Vivian. I've turned a blind eye to every single stunt that you've pulled against her.

28
00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:44.099
But no more. We're done here. Get out.

29
00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:49.260
Bitch.

30
00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:54.239
So how's the wedding arrangement going?

31
00:01:54.239 --> 00:02:00.299
She, uh, trashed the engagement gifts. Got it.

32
00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.299
I wish that DNA report was wrong.

33
00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:06.299
How did she turn out like this? She's so different from what I remember.

34
00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.460
But Lorne, there's something so familiar about her.

35
00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:19.430
I'm thinking I trust. There she is.

36
00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.430
Lorne, you're the right. Are you going back?

37
00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.430
I mean, you could, you know, my place is always open.

38
00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.430
Lorne, it's time to go home. What? Now you're done playing Big Brother, you're playing Prince Charming.

39
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.430
Choose your next words very carefully.

40
00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.430
Let me drive you back to the house. Just give me ten minutes. Hear me out.

41
00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.500
That's all I ask. Please.

42
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.500
You should go, Tom. I have to pack anyways. I'll text you later, okay?

43
00:02:46.500 --> 00:03:01.280
I have arranged Vivian's marriage. I like it or not, but she will leave.

44
00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.280
It's the point anymore. I did what you asked. Now what about you? Did you hold up your end?

45
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:12.789
Thanks for finally listening to me. But the trust is gone. If you don't love me, just let me go.

46
00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:18.680
You can keep Vivian here. I don't want to get hurt anymore.

47
00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:25.000
He's being with me really that unbearable. You are my fiance, carrying my child for God's sakes.

48
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:40.810
You can't just leave. This is as far as I'll bend.

49
00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:46.930
This house is not a hotel. You can't just come and go as you please.

50
00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:56.580
Don't forget how we heard you before. Lorne, you bitch. I'm gonna take what's mine.

51
00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:19.180
You can't see what Ryan chooses to save us. No! No, no, no, no.

52
00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:34.420
You're safe now. They got you.

53
00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.740
I thought you'd save Vivian first.

54
00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.740
Don't talk. You're freezing.

55
00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.740
It's mine. It's my tea.

56
00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.100
Simon, take care of Miss Vivian.

57
00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:51.459
Get down! All of you!

58
00:04:51.459 --> 00:05:27.389
Bitch, you're asking for it. Jacob, I need one less favor.

59
00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:30.389
Do you know any good therapists? What? What's wrong?

60
00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:36.639
Stress. Seeing and hearing things. These constant headaches.

61
00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:38.639
Seeing and hearing what?

62
00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:45.120
You seeing this young boy and hearing his name go for...

63
00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.079
What name?

64
00:05:48.079 --> 00:05:56.279
I think it's... I think it's... God, I can't remember.

65
00:05:56.279 --> 00:06:00.430
I know it's connected to my childhood somehow.

66
00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:02.430
Thinking about it makes my head hurt.

67
00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:36.740
Oh, then don't think about it. Just get some rest. We found you.

68
00:06:36.740 --> 00:07:05.579
Strange dream. You be connected to my past. Can't move in. I'm sorry.

69
00:07:05.579 --> 00:07:09.579
I thought I apologize, but I'm not sure about this. You're going to forgive him?

70
00:07:09.579 --> 00:07:14.610
It's not about forgiveness. I have things that I need to figure out.

71
00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:22.060
Just my baby's father, but everything I do is for the child. I don't expect anything else.

72
00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:24.060
You said the word and I could also be the child's father.

73
00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:27.060
As long as Vivian is around, he still keeps hurting you.

74
00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:29.120
Paul, please.

75
00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:39.209
Lauren, if being with him makes you happy, I'll support you.

76
00:07:39.209 --> 00:07:42.430
And if you need a shoulder, I'll be here for you.

77
00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:45.459
Though I hope you won't need one. Thanks me when you get home.

78
00:07:45.459 --> 00:08:04.519
Did your assight give you at 5 p.m.? Someone will meet you. Don't tell anyone.

79
00:08:04.519 --> 00:08:08.189
Who are you? What do you know? Tell me.

80
00:08:08.189 --> 00:08:18.660
5-2-1 Westwood Street. This is it. Where are they?

81
00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:26.939
Get her in the car. Quick.

82
00:08:26.939 --> 00:08:28.939
No! What?

83
00:08:28.939 --> 00:08:36.759
No!

84
00:08:36.759 --> 00:08:38.759
Where the hell is she?

85
00:08:38.759 --> 00:08:41.759
Why are you hiding here? It took her for a minute, didn't you?

86
00:08:41.759 --> 00:08:42.759
Be a man in a computer field.

87
00:08:42.759 --> 00:08:44.759
Bullshit, I'm looking for her too.

88
00:08:44.759 --> 00:08:47.759
But she's there with you? She left at 3?

89
00:08:47.759 --> 00:08:51.970
Check if she's home. Harry calls.

90
00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:54.970
She didn't come back yet, and someone said they saw her being forced into a van.

91
00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:57.970
I want her location right now.

92
00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:01.750
Wake up.

93
00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:08.250
Where am I? Jacob? We can go.

94
00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:10.250
A long time no see, dear Lauren.

95
00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:14.759
What do you want? I'm warning you. Ryan will find me.

96
00:09:14.759 --> 00:09:18.980
Perfect. The whole family back together for redemption.

97
00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:20.980
What are you talking about?

98
00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:27.210
A gift from your dear cousin, for your little nephews or your nieces.

99
00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:33.210
What? What is that? Back off. Don't you dare touch me.

100
00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:34.210
Oh.

101
00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:38.559
I found her. She's being held at the Westwood Harbor. Let's go.

102
00:09:38.559 --> 00:09:53.259
Drive. Hold on one. I'm coming. How much longer?

103
00:09:53.259 --> 00:09:55.259
20 minutes. Make it 10.

104
00:09:55.259 --> 00:10:00.820
Saw the strangers. I don't care. Run the life. Let's go.

105
00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:01.820
What is that?

106
00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:06.049
Abortion pills. Blessings from Vivian and me.

107
00:10:06.049 --> 00:10:10.210
Poor Lauren. Blame yourself for carrying Ryan's child.

108
00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:14.240
If the baby's gone, there's no threat to Vivian.

109
00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:28.940
Take off the cab.

110
00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:33.159
Wait, let's split up. Have a more grab. Let me check in there.

111
00:10:33.159 --> 00:10:36.220
Come on.

112
00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:37.220
Bill.

113
00:10:37.220 --> 00:11:00.500
She's taking the help.

114
00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:01.500
Triple it.

115
00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:02.500
Triple?

116
00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:06.500
Walk away now. Ryan won't let you off.

117
00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:10.500
Oh, I get it. You think this is about money?

118
00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:14.500
No, no, no, no, no. I want Ryan to suffer. Did you get it?

119
00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:18.500
I want him to know what real loss feels like.

120
00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:20.500
Now take the fucking pills.

121
00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:22.500
Do it, bitch.

122
00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:25.830
Lauren!

123
00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:29.250
Lay hands on my fiance. I'll skin you a lot.

124
00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:31.250
Big words for someone all alone.

125
00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:33.250
You really think you're going to get out of here tonight?

126
00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:34.600
Get up.

127
00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:47.539
Next time, at least make it interesting.

128
00:11:47.539 --> 00:11:48.539
Here.

129
00:11:48.539 --> 00:11:52.820
One more step, and I'll split her throat.

130
00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:58.620
By doing this, I hope you know you were declaring war on the Dawn family.

131
00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:01.879
Last chance. Let her go.

132
00:12:01.879 --> 00:12:04.940
Or I will make you regret ever coming here tonight.

133
00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:07.940
Nice try.

134
00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:10.940
I've got back up on speed dial.

135
00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:34.330
30 minutes without contact and my men will be here.

136
00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:36.330
Fine, it's just a scratch. You.

137
00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:54.419
Help me, Ryan.

138
00:12:54.419 --> 00:12:55.419
Go make one one now.

139
00:12:55.419 --> 00:13:09.700
This way, this way.

140
00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:14.299
Only medical staff passes away.

141
00:13:14.299 --> 00:13:21.000
Please be okay, Ryan.

142
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
Don't make me owe you like this.

143
00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.620
Look what you've done.

144
00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:29.620
This is so long as you.

145
00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:34.559
It should be you in that room, not him.

146
00:13:34.559 --> 00:13:36.559
To know who's really behind this.

147
00:13:36.559 --> 00:13:38.559
Once Ryan wakes up, your lies won't hold.

148
00:13:38.559 --> 00:13:41.779
Ryan needs a blood transfusion.

149
00:13:41.779 --> 00:13:44.779
Anybody would type the blood.

150
00:13:44.779 --> 00:13:49.429
I heard before.

151
00:13:49.429 --> 00:13:51.429
He's bleeding. I need anybody.

152
00:13:51.429 --> 00:13:55.429
Miss Vivian, I mean Miss Lore is type O.

153
00:13:55.429 --> 00:13:56.429
She can't.

154
00:13:56.429 --> 00:13:58.070
Lore?

155
00:13:58.070 --> 00:14:00.070
You finally found her?

156
00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:02.070
Why'd you wait so long to bring her back?

157
00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:03.070
No, I'm not.

158
00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:05.070
I'm type O. I can do it.

159
00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:11.330
Thank you for saving time.

160
00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:12.330
You should get some rest.

161
00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:13.970
Family.

162
00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:16.789
No need to.

163
00:14:16.789 --> 00:14:27.210
Why is no one here?

164
00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:40.529
You good?

165
00:14:40.529 --> 00:14:41.529
Well, again.

166
00:14:41.529 --> 00:14:42.529
It's Ryan okay.

167
00:14:42.529 --> 00:14:43.529
Ryan.

168
00:14:43.529 --> 00:14:45.529
Yeah, he's been through a lot.

169
00:14:45.529 --> 00:14:48.529
But, but Dory, you can go see him right over there.

170
00:14:48.529 --> 00:14:49.529
I gotta go lay down.

171
00:14:49.529 --> 00:14:50.529
Okay?

172
00:14:50.529 --> 00:14:55.340
Wait.

173
00:14:55.340 --> 00:15:09.100
I heard you.

174
00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:11.419
Oh my god.

175
00:15:11.419 --> 00:15:12.830
I'm alive.

176
00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:18.580
Get your hands away from him.

177
00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:20.580
How did you hurt him enough?

178
00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:26.539
Dory got you killed.

179
00:15:26.539 --> 00:15:27.539
I'm going to.

180
00:15:27.539 --> 00:15:28.539
That's enough.

181
00:15:28.539 --> 00:15:30.019
Let me go.

182
00:15:30.019 --> 00:15:31.019
Simon, it's fine.

183
00:15:31.019 --> 00:15:32.019
I'll handle this.

184
00:15:32.019 --> 00:15:34.019
You take long to get some rest.

185
00:15:34.019 --> 00:15:36.240
I'll come and see you soon.

186
00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:43.509
Okay.

187
00:15:43.509 --> 00:15:44.509
Still protecting her?

188
00:15:44.509 --> 00:15:45.509
Cut the act.

189
00:15:45.509 --> 00:15:48.509
We both know who was behind my attack.

190
00:15:48.509 --> 00:15:51.789
I mean Jacob didn't act alone.

191
00:15:51.789 --> 00:15:52.789
You helped him.

192
00:15:52.789 --> 00:15:54.789
You orchestrated the entire thing.

193
00:15:54.789 --> 00:15:59.110
If you touch my fiance again, I will kill you.

194
00:15:59.110 --> 00:16:01.110
How can you talk to me like this?

195
00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:03.110
I am your sister.

196
00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:04.460
Don't.

197
00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:06.460
Simon told me everything.

198
00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:07.460
You're not war.

199
00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:08.460
No.

200
00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:09.460
You're wrong.

201
00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:10.460
I can prove it.

202
00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:15.100
I am your sister, Ryan.

203
00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:17.100
This doesn't belong to you.

204
00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:18.100
They never did.

205
00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:20.100
I ordered the real DNA results.

206
00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:23.100
And as soon as I get them, I'll know the truth.

207
00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:25.100
And finally be done with you.

208
00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:26.100
Get around to my sight.

209
00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:27.100
Ryan!

210
00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:28.100
No!

211
00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:29.100
Ryan!

212
00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:36.620
Let me go!

213
00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:37.620
You should be resting.

214
00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:38.620
What's on your mind?

215
00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:39.620
I had another nightmare.

216
00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:40.620
What kind of nightmare?

217
00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:42.620
I was younger.

218
00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:44.620
And you were there too.

219
00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:47.620
Are you implying that I'm the reason that you're having these nightmares?

220
00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:48.620
No.

221
00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:50.620
But someone kept calling me lore.

222
00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:52.620
And he looked like a young boy.

223
00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:53.620
Right.

224
00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:54.620
Are you sure it was lore?

225
00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:55.620
What else do you remember?

226
00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:58.139
I think I fell from something.

227
00:16:58.139 --> 00:17:00.139
And I hit my head.

228
00:17:00.139 --> 00:17:01.139
It hurts.

229
00:17:01.139 --> 00:17:03.139
My head is splitting.

230
00:17:03.139 --> 00:17:05.140
Don, the DNA results are.

231
00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:14.549
What is it?

232
00:17:14.549 --> 00:17:16.549
All these years.

233
00:17:16.549 --> 00:17:18.549
You are the one who saved my life.

234
00:17:18.549 --> 00:17:19.549
What are you talking about?

235
00:17:19.549 --> 00:17:21.549
I have a surprise for you.

236
00:17:21.549 --> 00:17:22.549
Close your eyes.

237
00:17:22.549 --> 00:17:31.779
My necklace.

238
00:17:31.779 --> 00:17:32.779
You found it.

239
00:17:32.779 --> 00:17:34.849
Thank you so much, Ryan.

240
00:17:34.849 --> 00:17:40.559
They match perfectly.

241
00:17:40.559 --> 00:17:41.559
Lauren.

242
00:17:41.559 --> 00:17:44.299
You're the Uriel Lord.

243
00:17:44.299 --> 00:17:48.029
I've been searching for you for all these years.

244
00:17:48.029 --> 00:17:55.579
So, you're saying Logan?

245
00:17:55.579 --> 00:17:57.640
The doctor has my birth dad?

246
00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:59.640
The DNA doesn't lie.

247
00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:01.670
You're my stepsister.

248
00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:03.960
The real Don Eris.

249
00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:06.700
Oh my god.

250
00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:14.380
It won't abandon me.

251
00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:17.470
He tries to steal Mrs. Don's life.

252
00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:19.470
There's no use in denying it.

253
00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:20.470
No, no, no, no, no, no.

254
00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:23.819
It wasn't like this.

255
00:18:23.819 --> 00:18:25.819
You're gonna get what you deserve.

256
00:18:25.819 --> 00:18:45.480
I've never been happier than right now.

257
00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:46.480
Thanks to you.

258
00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:48.480
I feel the same way.

259
00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:50.480
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

260
00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:52.480
Dad will be here any minute.

261
00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:53.480
He said he can't wait to see you.

262
00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:54.480
Neither can I.

263
00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:56.480
But when I brought you some meds,

264
00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:58.480
they should help with the memory loss

265
00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:01.220
and with the baby.

266
00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:05.450
Thank you.

267
00:19:05.450 --> 00:19:06.450
My girl.

268
00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:08.450
My girl.

269
00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:09.450
Todd, we're here.

270
00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:11.450
Oh, you finally made it.

271
00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:15.890
After all these COVID sentences,

272
00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:17.890
after all these years,

273
00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:19.890
you've been through a lot.

274
00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:22.140
I have something for you.

275
00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:24.140
What?

276
00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:27.690
Cars, yachts,

277
00:19:27.690 --> 00:19:30.690
even cars with no living, no pin number.

278
00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:32.690
Use it however you like.

279
00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:34.690
Todd, thank you.

280
00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:36.690
And I also remember how much

281
00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:38.690
you like these pieces,

282
00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:40.690
these designer jewelry.

283
00:19:40.690 --> 00:19:43.690
Right now, I just want to focus on the baby.

284
00:19:43.690 --> 00:19:49.779
I got one more for you.

285
00:19:49.779 --> 00:19:52.140
Through whatever life throws at us,

286
00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:54.140
I promise to always be yours.

287
00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:57.329
I want to spend the rest of my life with you.

288
00:19:57.329 --> 00:20:00.579
We, we, we.
