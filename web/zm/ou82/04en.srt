1
00:00:06,769 --> 00:00:07,769
What did you do?

2
00:00:07,769 --> 00:00:08,769
That working?

3
00:00:08,769 --> 00:00:15,769
I was wondering why it was taking too long, made a dating profile for you, obviously.

4
00:00:15,769 --> 00:00:17,769
How about buying more?

5
00:00:17,769 --> 00:00:20,769
I had another dream about it last night.

6
00:00:20,769 --> 00:00:22,769
We're in so much trouble when we get home.

7
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:24,769
I'm trying to help.

8
00:00:24,769 --> 00:00:28,769
You're not looking out for us, so I'm going to find someone who will.

9
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:30,500
We need a mommy.

10
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,500
Yeah, we need a mom left.

11
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,820
Listen, we're not.

12
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,619
We really got to get these nose weeks checked now, buddy.

13
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:53,619
I'm so sorry about this misunderstanding.

14
00:00:53,619 --> 00:00:55,619
It's okay, mommy.

15
00:00:55,619 --> 00:00:57,619
Why do you keep calling me mommy?

16
00:00:57,619 --> 00:00:59,619
That's all you and my dream last night.

17
00:00:59,619 --> 00:01:03,060
Me too, I have twins.

18
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,060
I've once had twins.

19
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:07,060
Where are the twins?

20
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,060
Where are the twins?

21
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:10,219
I'm so sorry.

22
00:01:10,219 --> 00:01:13,219
They brought had conjunctal defects and stopped griefing.

23
00:01:13,219 --> 00:01:15,219
How old are you?

24
00:01:15,219 --> 00:01:16,219
What kind of do you want to marry?

25
00:01:16,219 --> 00:01:17,219
Mason.

26
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:19,219
What about this man?

27
00:01:19,219 --> 00:01:20,219
He has a decent job.

28
00:01:20,219 --> 00:01:22,219
He's divorced with two kids.

29
00:01:22,219 --> 00:01:25,219
And I've been spoken to women and me.

30
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:27,640
Are you asking for a spanking?

31
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,959
Hey, this is who violence isn't the answer.

32
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:33,760
Is that how you treat your children?

33
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,760
Hi, mommy.

34
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,760
Daddy's all tough.

35
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:39,260
Don't come here to raise my kids.

36
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:40,359
Do you have children?

37
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:44,409
All right, come on guys, let's go.

38
00:01:44,409 --> 00:01:49,650
Actually, do you want to come marry?
