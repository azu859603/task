1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
Do you have a marriage?

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,099
Marriage? She is beautiful.

3
00:00:04,099 --> 00:00:06,099
And the kids do like her.

4
00:00:06,099 --> 00:00:07,099
But after Anna.

5
00:00:07,099 --> 00:00:08,099
So...

6
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:09,099
I don't know.

7
00:00:09,099 --> 00:00:14,050
Hey, you make some things sister cries for me.

8
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:15,050
Yay!

9
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:21,500
Are you sure about this?

10
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,390
I mean, I'm with a horse out. I have two kids.

11
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:28,929
And them broke.

12
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:29,929
Really?

13
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:31,539
I mean...

14
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:35,539
By the way, you're dressed. It looks like you do fine.

15
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:40,539
Oh, no, this is a company uniform.

16
00:00:40,539 --> 00:00:41,539
I'm a driver.

17
00:00:41,539 --> 00:00:43,600
I'm for the CEO.

18
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,729
You have my queen eight to nine thousand dollars a month.

19
00:00:48,729 --> 00:00:49,729
Yeah, I'm broke.

20
00:00:49,729 --> 00:00:52,729
Nine thousand dollars? That's way more than I do.

21
00:00:52,729 --> 00:00:57,729
No, sorry. I mean, eight dollars to nine thousand dollars.

22
00:00:57,729 --> 00:01:01,729
I mean, grabbing when he's in town, he, you know, he travels a lot.

23
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:03,729
It's very broke.

24
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:06,730
Where do you live?

25
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:08,730
Oh, over in a green one.

26
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:10,730
Hmm. Green one.

27
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:11,730
That's where all the old money is.

28
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:13,730
Like, the richest of the rich.

29
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:18,349
You got me.

30
00:01:18,349 --> 00:01:20,349
That's where my boss lives.

31
00:01:20,349 --> 00:01:22,349
I don't have a house.

32
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:23,609
Yeah.

33
00:01:23,609 --> 00:01:25,609
I like to brag.

34
00:01:25,609 --> 00:01:26,609
But I'm broke.

35
00:01:26,609 --> 00:01:27,609
Me too.

36
00:01:27,609 --> 00:01:29,609
I'm a shoe sales person.

37
00:01:29,609 --> 00:01:32,609
I guess it was the top seller last month.

38
00:01:32,609 --> 00:01:33,609
Me.

39
00:01:33,609 --> 00:01:34,609
Me.

40
00:01:34,609 --> 00:01:35,609
Yeah.

41
00:01:35,609 --> 00:01:36,609
Me.

42
00:01:36,609 --> 00:01:37,609
Me.

43
00:01:37,609 --> 00:01:38,609
I'm broke.

44
00:01:38,609 --> 00:01:39,609
Isn't it?

45
00:01:39,609 --> 00:01:40,609
It's so bad.

46
00:01:40,609 --> 00:01:41,609
Look at the match.

47
00:01:41,609 --> 00:01:42,799
Oh.

48
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:43,799
Oh.

49
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:44,799
Shh.

50
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:45,799
Shh.

51
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:46,799
You know what?

52
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:47,799
Just think about it.

53
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:48,829
And talk to your kids.

54
00:01:48,829 --> 00:01:50,829
It's important that they want this too.

55
00:01:50,829 --> 00:01:54,400
And let me know by tomorrow.

56
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,400
Sure.

57
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,400
Thank you.
