1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.660
Daddy won't let me marry Mommy.

2
00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.660
Well, it's not that simple, Mason.

3
00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.660
The last woman I am married didn't love you, too.

4
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.660
Or me, for that matter.

5
00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:13.779
She only wanted my money.

6
00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:17.739
And I don't want to put you two through that again.

7
00:00:17.739 --> 00:00:20.059
Mommy's a lace-up.

8
00:00:20.059 --> 00:00:21.059
How do you know that?

9
00:00:21.059 --> 00:00:23.129
You met her yesterday.

10
00:00:23.129 --> 00:00:24.129
We can make a test.

11
00:00:24.129 --> 00:00:25.129
Yes.

12
00:00:25.129 --> 00:00:27.129
A daddy pretends to be poor.

13
00:00:27.129 --> 00:00:31.129
The mom is to marry, so they can be married for real life.

14
00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.189
That's actually not a bad idea.

15
00:00:35.189 --> 00:00:38.090
You two are pretty smart, huh?

16
00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.500
They get it from Mommy's side.

17
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.210
Well, I'll go tell Mommy the good news.

18
00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.899
Are you sure she's a real mommy?

19
00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:50.899
1,000 per second.

20
00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:53.899
I've been dreaming of her my whole life.

21
00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:57.109
Where are you getting the Mommy?

22
00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:00.619
Daddy's my dog, Bertie.

23
00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:01.619
Yay!
