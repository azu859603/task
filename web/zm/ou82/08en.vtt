00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:13.750
So you're starting right on when we're splitting the kids, huh?

2
00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:14.750
Of course.

3
00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.089
At the first time being a mom, I want to get them something special.

4
00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:22.929
I want this one, that one, and that one.

5
00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:26.190
Excuse me, how much are those over there?

6
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:31.570
Those are limited edition, $1,000 each.

7
00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.689
Is there any way they're part of the sale?

8
00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.310
No, just those.

9
00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.070
Oh, don't worry.

10
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.070
I have a membership here.

11
00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.390
I use my points as a discount.

12
00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:42.549
OK, that's perfect.

13
00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:44.109
Let's use my corn and your whites.

14
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.920
Wow.

15
00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.700
It's really you, Mr. P.

16
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:56.200
Yes.

17
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.259
Finally, I can use my points.

18
00:00:58.259 --> 00:01:02.700
How about both systems, sir?

19
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:03.539
Just right.

20
00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.500
Just, of course, sir.

21
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.019
All right, so let's go.

22
00:01:07.019 --> 00:01:08.510
All right, so let's go.

23
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:09.510
Thanks so much.

24
00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.099
Thank you.

25
00:01:13.099 --> 00:01:15.900
These kids really go crazy for Spider-Man.

26
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.140
No, thank you.

27
00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.859
And your kids are beautiful.

28
00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:20.980
They look exactly like you.

29
00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.590
Down to the mall.

30
00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.230
All right, he's got mall kids.
