1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:10,419
Do you need some help with that?

2
00:00:10,419 --> 00:00:11,419
No.

3
00:00:11,419 --> 00:00:13,419
No, I got it.

4
00:00:13,419 --> 00:00:19,030
It's easy here.

5
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:20,030
Here.

6
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:25,420
It just goes here.

7
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:27,420
Here we go.

8
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,489
Here we go.

9
00:00:29,489 --> 00:00:32,420
How are you so good at that?

10
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:35,420
Oh, I had to build all the furniture for my apartment.

11
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:38,119
It helps to be handy sometimes.

12
00:00:38,119 --> 00:00:44,020
Oh.

13
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:49,939
What's this?

14
00:00:49,939 --> 00:00:55,100
It's done to people.

15
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,100
It's this.

16
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,140
Can I have that back?

17
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,060
You want it?

18
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,060
Come here.

19
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:09,230
Throw it in your lap.

20
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:12,000
Remember that next time you taught me.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,890
It was really good.

22
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:21,890
Any way through a fashion school?

23
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:24,750
Oh, no.

24
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,750
I just really like designing when I was younger.

25
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,750
My mom said that I was a prodigy.

26
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,650
Why don't you pursue me?

27
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:37,319
Life hasn't been easy for me.

28
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:40,319
Sometimes it feels like I'm all down to get me.

29
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:43,920
Not that feeling.

30
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,230
But sometimes life offers in front of help.

31
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:51,060
Or a husband.
