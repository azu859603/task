00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:11.500
Mmm, this is delicious.

2
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.500
I mean is there anything you can't do?

3
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.199
Well, I can't juggle.

4
00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:20.710
No, I'm serious.

5
00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.739
I mean how'd you learn all these special skills?

6
00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:25.739
Well, it takes three steps.

7
00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:29.739
One, you mother has to pass away.

8
00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:35.060
Two, your father has to remarry and evil.

9
00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:39.159
That means you have to have a bully as a stepsister.

10
00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:43.250
After that, you can learn anything.

11
00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:56.100
I'm excited to pray.

12
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.539
Hey, aren't you supposed to be asleep?

13
00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:01.539
Hey, they have a point.

14
00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:07.540
You know, I sell crystal shoes, and Daddy tries to pump and carry.

15
00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.829
I'll clean up to her for you, my prince.

16
00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:14.829
Don't worry about it, Cinderella.

17
00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:15.829
Let me do it.

18
00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:18.900
It's a bad relax.

19
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:28.450
Things are going great with your little gold.

20
00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.769
Christina, Ag.

21
00:01:30.769 --> 00:01:33.629
Care so much about her.

22
00:01:33.629 --> 00:01:37.209
You wouldn't be touching real feelings now, would you?

23
00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:39.209
Don't be stupid.

24
00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:41.459
She's dreaming.

25
00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:44.969
Hey, that scar is in the face of this.

26
00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:46.969
Come by the clinic and we'll get that fixed up.

27
00:01:46.969 --> 00:02:07.239
Yeah, sure.

28
00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:15.449
It's been so long since I've felt a man.

29
00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:20.360
Looks so familiar if I've seen it.

30
00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.360
Sorry.

31
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:42.939
You got it.

32
00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:56.900
Go back to bed.

33
00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:57.900
Her cool family?

34
00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:58.960
Hello.

35
00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:59.960
Mmm.

36
00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.409
Is that a relax?

37
00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:05.409
Are those really expensive, how do you help them?

38
00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:10.409
Oh, no.

39
00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:12.659
This is a fake.

40
00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:15.659
You know, we turned to the real model that actually exists in the real world.

41
00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:16.659
Huh.

42
00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:17.659
Fake.

43
00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:20.740
Mmm.

44
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.740
Like I said that earlier, it looks so real.

45
00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:23.740
Yeah.

46
00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:24.740
The detail limits.

47
00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:26.810
I can't eat.

48
00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.810
But I mean, you could afford a $2 million watch, right?

49
00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:29.810
Sure.

50
00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:30.810
Yeah.

51
00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.289
Could you give me two more of us for my friends?

52
00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:37.659
I think it'd be great gifts.

53
00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:39.659
Anything for you, sweetie.

54
00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:40.659
Mmm.

55
00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:45.729
I wanna do now.

56
00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:53.449
Hi, sweetie.

57
00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:55.449
Here, take this money and go buy some ice cream.

58
00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:57.449
Mommy will be off work soon, okay?

59
00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:58.449
Okay, Mommy.

60
00:03:58.449 --> 00:04:03.580
Okay.

61
00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.330
Christina.

62
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.030
Hey, sis.

63
00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.030
Welcome.

64
00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.479
Is there anything I can help you with?

65
00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:16.670
I didn't know you worked here.

66
00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:23.410
I wish you had told me earlier that I could have been happy for a few days.

67
00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:28.240
Do you regret cutting ties with the family yet?

68
00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.240
Yes.

69
00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.240
I deeply, deeply regret it.

70
00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.240
I should have left that bloody place sooner.

71
00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:44.170
So I didn't have to find out how truly ugly you are.

72
00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:46.170
You always act so tough.

73
00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:50.129
But I don't believe it for a second.

74
00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:52.129
Dad just bought me a house on the outskirts.

75
00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:53.129
Just?

76
00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:56.420
I don't care about your personal matters.

77
00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:59.420
If you're not gonna buy shoes, can you please leave?

78
00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:01.639
Who said I'm not buying anything?

79
00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:04.639
I want you to help me personally.

80
00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:13.740
Why is being bullied?

81
00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:21.660
These are the hottest pick of the season.

82
00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.920
Well, shouldn't you put them on me?

83
00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:27.180
How else do I know if they look good or not?

84
00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:38.250
I've went to design school and here I am,

85
00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.250
designing high heels for a luxury brand.

86
00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.600
And here you are.

87
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.139
Where are them?

88
00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:48.509
Peter's $7,000.

89
00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:50.509
Will that be cash or card?

90
00:05:50.509 --> 00:05:52.120
Hold on.

91
00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.120
Let me think about it.

92
00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:57.870
What do you think you're doing?

93
00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:01.870
I just sent this to our old school friends.

94
00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:02.899
Huh?

95
00:06:02.899 --> 00:06:05.930
They said you look amazing.

96
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:06.930
Do you want me to wrap these up for you?

97
00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:16.379
This sale covers two months of my commission,

98
00:06:16.379 --> 00:06:19.379
so feel free to come back in tonight.

99
00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:26.759
Sweetie, are you okay?

100
00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:34.610
You're a mother?

101
00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:37.120
I don't know how to do this.

102
00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.279
These are my husband's children and it's none of your business.

103
00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:41.279
Oh.

104
00:06:41.279 --> 00:06:43.279
You're a stunt mother?

105
00:06:43.279 --> 00:06:45.379
Mommy, you're a business woman.

106
00:06:45.379 --> 00:06:48.850
So you just push around a little girl?

107
00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:49.850
Are you happy?

108
00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:51.850
What's wrong with you?

109
00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:52.850
So I pushed her a little.

110
00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:55.839
What's the big deal?

111
00:06:55.839 --> 00:06:56.839
Hello?

112
00:06:56.839 --> 00:06:57.870
911?

113
00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:58.870
Yes.

114
00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:01.870
There's been an incident at the idea issue store on shame, Marlene.

115
00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:03.379
Yeah.

116
00:07:03.379 --> 00:07:04.379
It's been a bad accident.

117
00:07:04.379 --> 00:07:07.379
Calling 911 because your kid was shoved a little.

118
00:07:07.379 --> 00:07:08.379
You're so dramatic.

119
00:07:08.379 --> 00:07:09.379
Oh.

120
00:07:09.379 --> 00:07:10.379
It's not for her.

121
00:07:10.379 --> 00:07:40.029
Suggest to see how good sex are.

122
00:07:40.029 --> 00:07:42.029
I'll put hatred into fear.

123
00:07:42.029 --> 00:07:46.019
It's a shame while security cameras burn today.

124
00:07:46.019 --> 00:07:47.019
You have?

125
00:07:47.019 --> 00:07:49.110
Yes.

126
00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:50.399
Try as you can eat.

127
00:07:50.399 --> 00:07:53.930
I guess we gotta add.

128
00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:54.930
I guess we gotta add.

129
00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:55.930
I find your special skills.

130
00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:56.930
Yeah.

131
00:07:56.930 --> 00:08:00.230
That's my resume.

132
00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:02.360
But I need a new job after this.

133
00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:03.420
Don't worry, darling.

134
00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:06.509
I'll always take care of you.

135
00:08:06.509 --> 00:08:10.439
I put a little money away for a rainy day like this.

136
00:08:10.439 --> 00:08:36.889
Just doing...

137
00:08:36.889 --> 00:08:39.889
I was drawing with the kids over here.

138
00:08:39.889 --> 00:08:41.139
Hey.

139
00:08:41.139 --> 00:08:42.139
You got a real talent.

140
00:08:42.139 --> 00:08:45.750
More than just a sales person.

141
00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:49.840
Why don't you be more than just a driver?

142
00:08:49.840 --> 00:09:00.519
I just never want to and nobody ever really cared if I went in.

143
00:09:00.519 --> 00:09:02.669
Look.

144
00:09:02.669 --> 00:09:03.740
I heard that.

145
00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:06.080
The creative agency.

146
00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:09.299
It's looking for a design assistance.

147
00:09:09.299 --> 00:09:10.460
Wait.

148
00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:11.460
O.L.?

149
00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:12.460
Yeah.

150
00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:15.460
Like the number one agency in the city?

151
00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:17.580
No.

152
00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:21.480
That's not a bad idea.

153
00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:32.019
I need you to give a heads up to O.L.

154
00:09:32.019 --> 00:09:35.379
A range of design assistance.

155
00:09:35.379 --> 00:09:36.379
Okay.

156
00:09:36.379 --> 00:09:39.259
Mr. Parker.

157
00:09:39.259 --> 00:09:40.259
From the red star real estate,

158
00:09:40.259 --> 00:09:43.259
comes to meet with you at the Starlight Club tonight.

159
00:09:43.259 --> 00:09:46.549
His assistant says he's about to ready to cause a deal.

160
00:09:46.549 --> 00:10:02.100
Mr. Parker for raising us with your presence.

161
00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:05.100
We truly hope to meet Parker with Parker corporations.

162
00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:07.100
Let's just celebrate that.

163
00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:08.419
Yeah.

164
00:10:08.419 --> 00:10:09.450
Yeah.

165
00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:10.450
Cheers.

166
00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:11.450
Cheers.

167
00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:12.450
Here we go.

168
00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:13.450
Or drinks as requested.

169
00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:22.190
Evan.

170
00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:27.740
Why is he touching you?

171
00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:29.179
Oh, well.

172
00:10:29.179 --> 00:10:31.179
It's actually a funny story, you know.

173
00:10:31.179 --> 00:10:33.179
My boss is meeting him to sign a deal.

174
00:10:33.179 --> 00:10:34.179
What do you drink too much?

175
00:10:34.179 --> 00:10:36.179
It's a real lightweight, you know.

176
00:10:36.179 --> 00:10:39.179
So my boss asked me to take one for the team.

177
00:10:39.179 --> 00:10:41.179
Because this guy drinks a lot.

178
00:10:41.179 --> 00:10:44.539
And if we can keep up, he will sign the deal.

179
00:10:44.539 --> 00:10:46.539
And I'll get a huge bonus for the boss.

180
00:10:46.539 --> 00:10:47.539
Wait, wait, wait.

181
00:10:47.539 --> 00:10:50.539
What exactly are you taking for the team and where are you taking it?

182
00:10:50.539 --> 00:10:51.539
Oh, God.

183
00:10:51.539 --> 00:10:52.539
No.

184
00:10:52.539 --> 00:10:53.629
No, no, no.

185
00:10:53.629 --> 00:10:54.629
He drinks a lot.

186
00:10:54.629 --> 00:10:57.629
And if we keep up, he'll sign the deal.

187
00:10:57.629 --> 00:11:00.629
My boss will give me a huge bonus, so please don't.

188
00:11:00.629 --> 00:11:03.730
Look at this for me.

189
00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:05.730
I hate rich people.

190
00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:07.730
They're always taking advantage of people like this.

191
00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:08.730
You know what?

192
00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:09.730
Do it with us.

193
00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:15.240
I got it.

194
00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:16.240
You want to drink?

195
00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:41.980
Let's drink.

196
00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:42.980
Good life.

197
00:11:42.980 --> 00:12:09.129
And carrots won't look like this before.

198
00:12:09.129 --> 00:12:12.730
Do you want some water or something?

199
00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:15.009
No.

200
00:12:15.009 --> 00:12:17.009
You shouldn't drink if you can't handle your liquor.

201
00:12:17.009 --> 00:12:19.000
What?

202
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:54.500
Let's see if you can handle it.

203
00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:55.500
You okay?

204
00:12:55.500 --> 00:13:21.269
Morning sleep computer.

205
00:13:21.269 --> 00:13:23.370
What do you want for breakfast?

206
00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:27.490
Why are you being all caring all of a sudden?

207
00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:31.879
Last word.

208
00:13:31.879 --> 00:13:33.809
Last word?

209
00:13:33.809 --> 00:13:38.750
Oh, yeah.

210
00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:41.100
Oh, I kissed a dog.

211
00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:47.100
There's food in the fridge.

212
00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:48.100
Make whatever you want.

213
00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:54.019
Brad's on the OL job, by the way.

214
00:13:54.019 --> 00:13:58.110
I guess this dog knows a few useful tricks, huh?

215
00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:17.659
I got a job offer from the well.

216
00:14:17.659 --> 00:14:37.690
Actually, honey, mom doesn't like kissing dogs.

217
00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:40.460
He's just, he's being a grumpy man.

218
00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:41.460
He doesn't want to kiss mom.

219
00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:46.279
Okay, grumpy, grumpy, grumpy.

220
00:14:46.279 --> 00:14:56.740
Okay, that is the complete part of it.

221
00:14:56.740 --> 00:15:00.460
Hey boss.

222
00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:01.460
It was a bit jammed.

223
00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:03.899
We're going to be leaving.

224
00:15:03.899 --> 00:15:05.509
Bumps?

225
00:15:05.509 --> 00:15:06.509
No.

226
00:15:06.509 --> 00:15:07.509
No, you missed her.

227
00:15:07.509 --> 00:15:09.539
He said, it's an ass.

228
00:15:09.539 --> 00:15:10.539
In a cool nickname.

229
00:15:10.539 --> 00:15:14.899
Let's see.

230
00:15:14.899 --> 00:15:15.899
Let's go.

231
00:15:15.899 --> 00:15:28.919
I didn't expect you to know the CEO's assistant.

232
00:15:28.919 --> 00:15:30.919
You got a really good connection.

233
00:15:30.919 --> 00:15:32.340
Wait.

234
00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:35.340
I got the OL designer job really slowly.

235
00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:37.340
Is that because you use your connections by an assistant?

236
00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:40.740
No, come on.

237
00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:43.740
But I'm just a driver, you know?

238
00:15:43.740 --> 00:16:00.389
I'm Christina Hayes.

239
00:16:00.389 --> 00:16:02.389
I'm a new design assistant.

240
00:16:02.389 --> 00:16:05.389
And I cannot wait to help this great agency reach new heights.

241
00:16:05.389 --> 00:16:13.409
You persistent.

242
00:16:13.409 --> 00:16:16.049
I could say the same thing about you.

243
00:16:16.049 --> 00:16:21.049
A sales person with a high school education thinks they're qualified to be my colleague.

244
00:16:21.049 --> 00:16:23.779
That's rich.

245
00:16:23.779 --> 00:16:25.779
Well, good thing you're not the one hiring.

246
00:16:25.779 --> 00:16:29.519
Management, obviously, thinks that I'm qualified.

247
00:16:29.519 --> 00:16:34.000
So, if you don't want to work here anymore, feel free to leave anytime.

248
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:40.230
Everyone, Ryan has just arrived downstairs.

249
00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:42.230
Hurry and get ready.

250
00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:49.090
Christina, Ryan is a very important client returning from overseas.

251
00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:52.149
He's looking for new designs for his shoe brand.

252
00:16:52.149 --> 00:16:55.149
If you mess this up, prepare to be fired.

253
00:16:55.149 --> 00:17:11.680
I'm not satisfied with these.

254
00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:14.779
I mean, you guys used to do excellent work.

255
00:17:14.779 --> 00:17:17.190
Is this all we got?

256
00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:22.740
A shut up.

257
00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:24.740
Apologies, Ryan.

258
00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:26.740
She's a new design assistant.

259
00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:28.740
And she plagiarized someone else's work.

260
00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:31.660
Is that so?

261
00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:32.660
Yes.

262
00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:33.660
Indeed.

263
00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:35.660
I did reference someone else's work.

264
00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:45.380
Inspired by the famous painting, a glass of wine, the design of the heels are based on the lines of a wine glass.

265
00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:50.500
It's passionate, unrestrained, but holds nobility.

266
00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:54.500
I think it's very on-brand for your company and my humble opinion.

267
00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:57.299
I am impressed.

268
00:17:57.299 --> 00:17:59.299
The shape of a wine glass.

269
00:17:59.299 --> 00:18:00.660
Let me guess.

270
00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:02.660
You must be a fan of red wine.

271
00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:03.720
Yes.

272
00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:07.720
My husband is a wizard at finding great deals for red wine.

273
00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:12.720
I've learned a few things about red wine from him, actually.

274
00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:18.720
I feel like sometimes the only inspiration that I need comes from reaching the bottom of a bottom.

275
00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:20.819
You have charm.

276
00:18:21.819 --> 00:18:25.819
And I can tell that oil still has the top talents.

277
00:18:25.819 --> 00:18:28.490
I look forward to working with you guys.

278
00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:33.859
This, Ryan, we are thrilled to work with you.

279
00:18:33.859 --> 00:18:42.309
Christina, why don't we invite Ryan over to your place tonight to sample some of this amazing wine?

280
00:18:42.309 --> 00:18:46.309
Well, we just moved into our house, so it's quite messy.

281
00:18:46.309 --> 00:18:48.309
I wouldn't want to inconvenience him.

282
00:18:48.309 --> 00:18:50.309
Oh, nonsense.

283
00:18:50.309 --> 00:18:53.309
I'm sure Ryan doesn't mind a few moving boxes.

284
00:18:53.309 --> 00:18:57.309
Unless you don't want anyone to go over because you're lying about the wine.

285
00:18:57.309 --> 00:18:58.500
Of course not.

286
00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:02.829
Thank you.

287
00:19:02.829 --> 00:19:07.109
Let's see how you can pull this.

288
00:19:07.109 --> 00:19:10.099
Hello?

289
00:19:10.099 --> 00:19:13.430
Have you got it?

290
00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:15.430
You don't want me to trip.

291
00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:20.759
Mason, listen closely.

292
00:19:20.759 --> 00:19:25.759
When we have the big client coming over at 6 p.m. tonight, take your sister and hide in your room.

293
00:19:25.759 --> 00:19:28.589
I must not be disturbed, understood?

294
00:19:28.589 --> 00:19:29.589
Yes, ma'am.

295
00:19:29.589 --> 00:19:31.589
I don't have time to explain.

296
00:19:31.589 --> 00:19:32.589
Can you please just do as I ask?

297
00:19:32.589 --> 00:19:33.589
You got it, mommy.

298
00:19:33.589 --> 00:19:35.589
Is mommy in trouble?

299
00:19:35.589 --> 00:19:37.589
No, boy can help it.

300
00:19:37.589 --> 00:19:40.549
Nanny, mommy's in trouble.

301
00:19:40.549 --> 00:19:41.549
We need your help.

302
00:19:41.549 --> 00:19:53.240
A cool light.

303
00:19:53.240 --> 00:20:17.740
Are you sure you guys don't want to go somewhere else?

304
00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:22.650
This place is perfect.

305
00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:23.650
Hellman Original.

306
00:20:23.650 --> 00:20:27.569
It can't possibly be this.

307
00:20:27.569 --> 00:20:33.839
That's too bad, but at least there's the wine, right?

308
00:20:33.839 --> 00:20:39.450
Now, where's this wonderful wine you were telling us all about?

309
00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:56.940
Is this in 1987 a total of feet, Rothschild?

310
00:20:56.940 --> 00:20:57.940
Yes.

311
00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:01.599
What do you know about wine?

312
00:21:01.599 --> 00:21:04.589
Obviously more than you.

313
00:21:04.589 --> 00:21:10.380
I mean, for someone who drinks so much, I'm surprised you don't know what this is.

314
00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:11.380
My whole life.

315
00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:23.920
I've dreamt of tasting this vintage.

316
00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:27.920
As Hayes, I never expected your family to be so wealthy.

317
00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:30.920
This wine is too precious, I dare not drink it.

318
00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:32.019
You may cast.

319
00:21:32.019 --> 00:21:34.019
Drink as you please.

320
00:21:34.019 --> 00:21:35.019
Thank you for your hospitality.

321
00:21:35.019 --> 00:21:36.019
I actually brought some dessert.

322
00:21:36.019 --> 00:21:38.019
If that's okay, I'd like mango cake.

323
00:21:38.019 --> 00:21:45.319
I appreciate it, but me and my step-children are allergic.

324
00:21:45.319 --> 00:21:52.369
Your home is decorated with some great taste and quite a bit of flair.

325
00:21:52.369 --> 00:21:54.230
Cheers to the homemaker.

326
00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:56.829
Cheers.

327
00:21:56.829 --> 00:22:42.509
You want me to feel the allergic?

328
00:22:42.509 --> 00:22:43.509
Don't you know the allergic to mangoes?

329
00:22:43.509 --> 00:22:45.509
Quick to the emergency room.

330
00:22:45.509 --> 00:22:46.509
Wait, don't you?

331
00:22:46.509 --> 00:22:47.509
Just in front of your husband's.

332
00:22:47.509 --> 00:22:53.660
Hurry up.

333
00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:54.660
How are my son-in-law Linda?

334
00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:55.660
She's fine.

335
00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:56.660
Just resting.

336
00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:58.299
Hey, Christina?

337
00:22:58.299 --> 00:23:00.299
She's been taking care of the kids.

338
00:23:00.299 --> 00:23:01.660
She cares about them a lot.

339
00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:04.329
Maybe she'd come clean.

340
00:23:04.329 --> 00:23:05.329
Me, Son, Linda.

341
00:23:05.329 --> 00:23:19.640
Hey, you're okay.

342
00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:20.640
You're okay.

343
00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:21.640
Just relax.

344
00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:22.640
I'm so sorry.

345
00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:25.640
I don't know how they got their hands on that mango cake.

346
00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:26.640
It's okay.

347
00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:27.640
Everyone makes mistakes.

348
00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:29.640
Everyone has those days.

349
00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:34.690
And, uh, you know, another year.

350
00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:39.380
Here, I want to talk to you about something.

351
00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:40.900
What?

352
00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:45.460
I'm not just some broke.

353
00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:58.059
I'm the kind of guy who's in magazines.

354
00:23:58.059 --> 00:24:00.059
And newspapers.

355
00:24:00.059 --> 00:24:02.730
And I actually got my own, uh,

356
00:24:02.730 --> 00:24:04.730
Wikipedia page dedicated to me.

357
00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:06.890
Are you a wanted criminal?

358
00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:10.490
You-you mentioned having an ex-wife

359
00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:12.490
that went abroad after your divorce.

360
00:24:12.490 --> 00:24:13.490
Is that what this is about?

361
00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:14.490
If I'm just a wanted criminal,

362
00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:16.490
why'd I be walking around public?

363
00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:17.490
No.

364
00:24:17.490 --> 00:24:19.700
I want it.

365
00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:21.700
What I actually want to tell you is...

366
00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:24.250
I, um...

367
00:24:24.250 --> 00:24:25.380
Oh, okay.

368
00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:26.380
You're both here.

369
00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:27.380
Is everything okay?

370
00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:29.380
I'm waiting for one more to slow it from Mason,

371
00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:31.380
but it seems like that we're covering

372
00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:33.380
and giving it discharge by morning.

373
00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:34.380
Oh, thank God.

374
00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:36.440
Thank you, Gary.

375
00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:37.440
Oh!

376
00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:38.440
By the way, Christina,

377
00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:40.440
congrats on the new job.

378
00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:41.440
Do you see Ethan Parker rounds?

379
00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:43.569
Let me know.

380
00:24:43.569 --> 00:24:47.269
Why would Ethan Parker be around a while?

381
00:24:47.269 --> 00:24:52.269
Because it's owned by the Parker Corporation.

382
00:24:52.269 --> 00:24:53.299
Wait.

383
00:24:53.299 --> 00:24:55.750
That jerk Parker?

384
00:24:55.750 --> 00:25:04.400
Jerk.

385
00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:05.400
I actually hear him, so.

386
00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:07.400
A really great entrepreneur in the city.

387
00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:09.940
And that he's really handsome.

388
00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:11.940
A talented one.

389
00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:13.940
And they donate a lot of money to charity.

390
00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:15.940
Can you just start talking about him?

391
00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:16.940
You're giving me the egg.

392
00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:18.940
Can you just tell me what you wanted to tell me?

393
00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:22.380
I forgot it.

394
00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:24.380
I'm gonna go catch up with Gary,

395
00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:26.380
so...

396
00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:28.599
You stay here, huh?

397
00:25:28.599 --> 00:25:37.660
Thanks a lot for that.

398
00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:39.660
Apparently, she already hates me.

399
00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:41.660
Have you done anything in the past to hurt her?

400
00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:42.660
No, wait.

401
00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:44.660
I met her last week.

402
00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:45.660
So, what?

403
00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:47.660
Could've told you were the top tycoon in New York.

404
00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:50.660
Bet you 99% of women would've loved to hear that.

405
00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:53.299
She hates you.

406
00:25:53.299 --> 00:25:57.690
So, if you tell her identity, it's game over.

407
00:25:57.690 --> 00:25:59.460
Here's an idea.

408
00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:03.460
How about you just keep your identity a secret?

409
00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:24.420
Some Christina into the lion's den.

410
00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:31.180
Christina.

411
00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:34.279
This is a glass art piece that a client ordered.

412
00:26:34.279 --> 00:26:37.279
If you break it, prepare to be fired.

413
00:26:37.279 --> 00:26:44.660
Hey, honey, I'll be coming home a little bit late.

414
00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:47.660
I need to do the grip package to a client.

415
00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:54.900
Oh dear.

416
00:26:54.900 --> 00:27:07.500
I need to do the grip package to a client.

417
00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:10.940
You are married?

418
00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:20.460
I need to talk about this at home.

419
00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:32.740
And how long were you planning to keep this marriage from us?

420
00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:34.740
You haven't dated in years.

421
00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:37.740
Your last wife was more married with convenience over love.

422
00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:41.019
Look, I want to meet my daughter-in-law.

423
00:27:41.019 --> 00:27:43.019
Honey, we have to get gifts.

424
00:27:43.019 --> 00:27:46.380
The lake house in Los Angeles.

425
00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:48.380
You know, the one in Vancouver is much better.

426
00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:59.230
So soon.

427
00:27:59.230 --> 00:28:04.849
Look, mom, you got to relax.

428
00:28:04.849 --> 00:28:05.849
You guys can meet her again.

429
00:28:05.849 --> 00:28:07.849
There's no wealthy, there's just no driver.

430
00:28:07.849 --> 00:28:10.450
What?

431
00:28:10.450 --> 00:28:12.019
What?

432
00:28:12.019 --> 00:28:14.019
You're deceiving her into a marriage?

433
00:28:14.019 --> 00:28:20.500
Look, there's no time to explain, but I need you both to change your clothes.

434
00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:29.970
What's taking so long?

435
00:28:29.970 --> 00:28:33.339
Hey, honey.

436
00:28:33.339 --> 00:28:35.069
Evan?

437
00:28:35.069 --> 00:28:37.900
Come on in.
