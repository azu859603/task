1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:07,370
Um, so your Ethan Parker's stripe?

2
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:09,369
Yep.

3
00:00:09,369 --> 00:00:15,349
That's why you had that response when I called him a dog.

4
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:18,350
Oh, um, this is my mother.

5
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:23,350
She's raised three generations of the parkers, and my dad, the gardener.

6
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:27,350
And we all work Ethan Parker.

7
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:31,559
Hi mom, hi dad.

8
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:36,219
Hi.

9
00:00:36,219 --> 00:00:38,219
She's very excited.

10
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:40,219
It is so nice to meet you.

11
00:00:40,219 --> 00:00:44,219
Ethan, I can't believe you've been holding out for so long.

12
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:48,219
Um, what do you do for work, uh, daughter?

13
00:00:48,219 --> 00:00:52,219
I work as a design assistant at OL Creative Agency.

14
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:57,219
Ah, I see my son knows how to keep it in the family.

15
00:00:57,219 --> 00:00:59,219
Because we all work for the parkers.

16
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:00,219
Of course.

17
00:01:00,219 --> 00:01:02,219
Yeah.

18
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:04,219
This house is really beautiful.

19
00:01:04,219 --> 00:01:10,700
What do you guys love?

20
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,700
I thought you were at the office today.

21
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,859
Why are you here?

22
00:01:14,859 --> 00:01:16,859
Oh, yes.

23
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:19,859
I'm here to deliver a glass art piece for Ethan Parker.

24
00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:22,859
This is a Celine Perkins original.

25
00:01:22,859 --> 00:01:36,700
My god, how could that have happened?

26
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,700
I was so careful.
