Christina, I came to see about the handover. How's it going?

2
00:00:09.689 --> 00:00:18.300
I asked you to deliver an R piece and you bring the whole family?

3
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.039
Are you all here to steal from the parkers?

4
00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:31.170
Hey, some insulting people. My husband is Ethan Parker's driver.

5
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.679
That gift was? I asked you to do something and-

6
00:00:33.679 --> 00:00:37.570
My God, there's no need to shout.

7
00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.570
Who allowed you to interfere in my conversation?

8
00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.570
And who are you to talk to my husband like that?

9
00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.759
Regina, show some respect, okay? They work for the parkers as well.

10
00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:51.759
I don't care who they are. This piece was worth millions.

11
00:00:51.759 --> 00:00:55.759
You poor servants can make up for it if you worked your whole miserable lives.

12
00:00:55.759 --> 00:00:59.759
That's bold words. The person who actually broke it.

13
00:00:59.759 --> 00:01:02.759
I don't know what you're talking about.

14
00:01:02.759 --> 00:01:08.760
Oh, okay, I can show you. This is a CCTV footage of the parker companies.

15
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:17.730
And that's you breaking it and then handing it to Christina.

16
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.730
Funny, huh? Whatever.

17
00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:27.290
Gotta get her fired. We could arrest her. Oh, man.

18
00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.739
It's okay. This is a family man. I'll handle it.
