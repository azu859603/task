00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.330
Allow me to introduce myself. I'm even barford. Christina's husband.

2
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.330
So you are the ones who can terrorize my wife.

3
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.100
Nice to put faces to the names.

4
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:22.100
Mr. Parker, please forgive us. We won't dare to trouble Christina ever again.

5
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.219
Not good enough. I want you out of my city.

6
00:00:25.219 --> 00:00:27.320
But what about my company?

7
00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.280
Well, don't worry about that.

8
00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.600
Your company's bankrupt.

9
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:37.049
I've made sure of it. I enjoy living on the streets.

10
00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:40.049
Are you kidding me? What about Christina's plagiarism?

11
00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:44.140
Well, she has class. I'm like you.

12
00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.229
And Christina finds out I'm Ethan Parker.

13
00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:49.520
Alice, he goes one of you.

14
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:55.979
And I make living on the streets a lot more difficult.

15
00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:57.979
Mr. Parker, we're wrong.

16
00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:01.880
We won't dare do it again.

17
00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.060
Sir, please.

18
00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.790
It's over.

19
00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.790
The Hayes family is done for.
