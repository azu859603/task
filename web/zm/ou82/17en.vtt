00:00:04.209 --> 00:00:07.519
I need to see you.

2
00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:10.519
These same places always don't be late.

3
00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:16.820
Make it quick. I'm a very busy person.

4
00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.820
Christina has married a very powerful person.

5
00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.820
What kind of person in power could she find?

6
00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.820
Ethan Parker.

7
00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.100
The CEO of the Parker Corporation.

8
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.100
How the hell did they end up together?

9
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.100
I don't know.

10
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.420
What if she finds out that we abducted her children?

11
00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.420
Her children are dead.

12
00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.539
Do not mention them.

13
00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:43.020
What did you do?

14
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.009
I might have already let it slip.

15
00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:49.009
I don't know who you are, but I'm sure there's something you can do.

16
00:00:49.009 --> 00:00:52.009
Come on, please. Help me. You bone me.

17
00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:55.100
We are done here.

18
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.100
You were well paid five years ago.

19
00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.100
Do not contact me again or there will be consequences.
