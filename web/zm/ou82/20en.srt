1
00:00:02,029 --> 00:00:04,030
Forget it. Forget it.

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:08,220
You said they were, they were, you know, right?

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,220
I guess we'll just save money on flowers in the future.

4
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:19,089
I told you, stop worrying about money.

5
00:00:19,089 --> 00:00:21,629
How can you say that?

6
00:00:21,629 --> 00:00:24,789
We have a family to take care of.

7
00:00:24,789 --> 00:00:27,050
And I will take care of them.

8
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:28,050
Like us.

9
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:35,920
And speaking of which, I have something to tell you.

10
00:00:35,920 --> 00:01:15,180
Yeah, so you can investigate the grievances between you and Christina.

11
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,819
Here are the results.

12
00:01:17,819 --> 00:01:25,640
Sketches.

13
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,829
Why are you showing me this?

14
00:01:27,829 --> 00:01:29,829
This is a design by Christina from eight years ago.

15
00:01:29,829 --> 00:01:32,829
It went on the college design gold award.

16
00:01:32,829 --> 00:01:34,829
But it was flagged for plagiarism.

17
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:40,750
Not only did she lose the award, but she got expelled from the school.

18
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:48,180
That's sad, but how does that play to her, hating me?

19
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:52,180
The one who reported her was Anna, our ex-wife.

20
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:59,760
They were classmates and trials.

21
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:06,280
And she did it under your name.

22
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,699
Sorry.

23
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:19,400
Why would she do that?

24
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,060
Hi.

25
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:25,060
Please cancel all expenses for Anna's overseas adventures.

26
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,379
Thank you.
