00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.900
Everyone, I would like to introduce our new client, the renowned designer, Ms. Anna Ellis.

2
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.619
Christina Hayes.

3
00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:14.619
You know me?

4
00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:15.619
Of course.

5
00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:18.620
I've been following your work for a long time.

6
00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:22.620
I want to assign Ms. Hayes full responsibility of this project.

7
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:23.620
Of course.

8
00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:30.679
A hundred thousand dollar bonus.

9
00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:34.840
I saw your work eight years ago and admired it greatly.

10
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.840
This collaboration is solely because of you, Christina.

11
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.799
I've never been appreciated like this before.

12
00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:43.929
Do you have time tonight?

13
00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:45.929
Let's discuss over dinner.

14
00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:47.280
Yeah.

15
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.280
Okay.

16
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.280
I'll make a reservation.

17
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.280
Oh, I don't like crowded places.

18
00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.280
Let's go to your house.

19
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.659
See you tonight.

20
00:00:54.659 --> 00:01:04.819
It's quite a spread.

21
00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:07.890
We're going to have peanut butter sandwich to the graduate restaurant.

22
00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.019
It's a hundred thousand dollars.

23
00:01:09.019 --> 00:01:11.019
What do we do not entertain?

24
00:01:11.019 --> 00:01:14.959
Oh.

25
00:01:14.959 --> 00:01:16.959
I'm going to go get that key finish tonight.

26
00:01:16.959 --> 00:01:17.959
Yeah.

27
00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:26.450
Switching to my home.

28
00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:27.450
This is my husband.

29
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.450
And this is...

30
00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:29.450
Mason and Melinda.

31
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.859
I brought a strawberry cake for you.

32
00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:36.980
That's so sweet of you.

33
00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:37.980
Thank you.

34
00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:39.980
I shouldn't have gone through all that trouble.

35
00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.980
But how did you know that they like strawberry?

36
00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.980
Because I am their biological mother.
