00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.400
It's been so great reconnecting with my kids and husband.

2
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.429
I don't know why I've been left in the first place.

3
00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:09.500
Oh, that reminds me.

4
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.500
I need to go to Casley Kindergarten soon.

5
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.500
It's only my childhood, Casley Kindergarten.

6
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.500
Your kids go there?

7
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.500
I'd kill to get my son into that place.

8
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.500
Good luck. You'd never get in.

9
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:22.589
Sorry to run.

10
00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:26.589
I need to meet Ethan for the kid's parent teacher in her view.

11
00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:29.800
Excuse me.

12
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.090
Hi. Can I take the rest of the afternoon off?

13
00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.539
That's fine, but this will cost you a vacation day.

14
00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:38.539
All right, let's make it.

15
00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:41.810
I'm not late, am I?

16
00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:44.320
What are you doing here?

17
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.320
I'm their mother.

18
00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.320
Surely this meeting applies to me, too.

19
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.320
Absolutely mothers don't count.

20
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.320
Get out of here before you embarrass yourself.

21
00:00:51.320 --> 00:01:01.659
I wish she's gone. Why does she keep coming to visit?

22
00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:04.040
Don't worry about it, honey.

23
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.489
Look at her.
