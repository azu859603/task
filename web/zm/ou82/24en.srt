1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,859
What are you doing here?

2
00:00:03,859 --> 00:00:05,860
The kids call me mommy.

3
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:07,950
What do you think I'm doing here?

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,019
The school called me here.

5
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:12,019
Did they call you?

6
00:00:12,019 --> 00:00:15,880
After all, I am their real mother.

7
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,879
I understand you want more time.

8
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:21,579
I'm not here just to spend more time with them.

9
00:00:21,579 --> 00:00:23,579
I'm taking back what belongs to me.

10
00:00:23,579 --> 00:00:26,100
And what would that be?

11
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:30,250
My husband and my children.

12
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:34,250
So you used your job to get close to me just so you can destroy my life.

13
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:37,250
I give you the opportunity to become someone great

14
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,250
and you're sacrificing it for what?

15
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:43,250
A divorced man and two children who aren't yours?

16
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,539
I'll finish that project.

17
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:48,539
Take the money and protect my family.

18
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:51,859
We'll see who they choose in the end.

19
00:00:51,859 --> 00:00:54,460
May the best mother win.
