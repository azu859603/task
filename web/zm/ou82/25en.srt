1
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:07,559
I want the finished designs on my desk by Monday.

2
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:11,220
Are you serious?

3
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:16,579
It's Friday, and I'm taking the kids to the aquarium this weekend.

4
00:00:16,579 --> 00:00:20,579
Funny, I was planning to take them on a yacht trip this weekend.

5
00:00:20,579 --> 00:00:26,579
Tell me, do you think they'd rather go with you to a crowded aquarium to eat cheap burgers,

6
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:29,579
or with me to a private beach to enjoy a French beast?

7
00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:33,119
You can't buy their love, Anna.

8
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:53,259
What are you doing here, Anna?

9
00:00:53,259 --> 00:00:55,310
Can we talk?

10
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:57,380
Nothing to talk about.

11
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,659
Must you be so cold to me?

12
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:01,759
We weren't married at one point.

13
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:02,759
My name only.

14
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:06,430
We got married because you got pregnant.

15
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:08,719
Oh, I love little Mason Melinda.

16
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:10,719
You don't love them.

17
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:13,719
How could I not love my children?

18
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:18,719
I carried them for nine months when they're sleepless nights,

19
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:22,719
morning sickness, and pushing my organs around to give them life.

20
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:31,640
I'm asking to make amends.

21
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,959
Can you please fulfill the wish of a humble mother?
