1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:24,410
Did you block an Instagram?

2
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:25,410
Oh, did I?

3
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,370
I almost met an accident.

4
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:30,170
Oh.

5
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:32,420
Well, could you unblock me?

6
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:36,340
Maybe.

7
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:37,340
What's the matter?

8
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:39,179
Nothing.

9
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:40,880
Nothing.

10
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,579
So you're not upset?

11
00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:46,450
Is there a reason for me to be?

12
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:48,179
Nope.

13
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:52,420
Then I'm not upset.

14
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,859
Alright.

15
00:00:54,859 --> 00:00:55,859
Just had a curiosity.

16
00:00:55,859 --> 00:01:00,250
Do you have any plans with the kids this weekend?

17
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:01,250
Uh...

18
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:02,250
Yeah?

19
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,250
I've got a few things lined up.

20
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:08,620
What plans?

21
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:10,620
Um, we're gonna go see my parents.

22
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,620
They miss their grandkids.

23
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:29,019
Is that your husband?

24
00:01:29,019 --> 00:01:30,019
That's him.

25
00:01:30,019 --> 00:01:32,299
The steak goes behind.

26
00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:33,299
It's gonna be extra.

27
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:35,909
Tomorrow I'll get you a big tip.

28
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:43,959
Pretty well, miss.

29
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:45,120
Where are we?

30
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:51,569
To see a side back hotel.

31
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:52,569
Please, darling.

32
00:01:52,569 --> 00:01:57,659
Oh, my goodness.

33
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:58,659
That's how I ended, right?

34
00:01:58,659 --> 00:02:03,939
No, I just realized I made a really big mistake.

35
00:02:03,939 --> 00:02:10,159
You think that's your miss?

36
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:11,159
No.

37
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:12,379
I...

38
00:02:12,379 --> 00:02:13,379
I need to go out.

39
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:14,379
How?

40
00:02:14,379 --> 00:02:15,379
How where?

41
00:02:15,379 --> 00:02:42,400
To the nearest bar.

42
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,400
I'm gonna go find Mommy.

43
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,979
Can I stay here?

44
00:02:44,979 --> 00:02:46,979
If anyone knocks, open the door.

45
00:02:46,979 --> 00:02:55,659
Okay?

46
00:02:55,659 --> 00:02:56,659
What do you do with my wife?

47
00:02:56,659 --> 00:03:08,949
I'm so easy, ladies.

48
00:03:08,949 --> 00:03:14,860
You all were in on it.

49
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:17,050
You told me you were going to see your parents.

50
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:20,300
But really you saw Anna.

51
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,300
How'd you know?

52
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:27,969
I'm not gonna stop you from talking to me.

53
00:03:27,969 --> 00:03:32,150
You want to, but just stop by.

54
00:03:32,150 --> 00:04:21,540
My face!

55
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,750
It's all you saw.

56
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:24,750
We liked it.

57
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:25,750
Look how she posts her Instagram.

58
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:26,750
So I got you a...

59
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,910
Look how she feasts.

60
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:31,490
And my more surprise.

61
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:33,779
The kids taught me to do it.

62
00:04:33,779 --> 00:04:41,069
Our family is complete without a family pet.

63
00:04:41,069 --> 00:04:56,290
Mommy, our old father was following us today.

64
00:04:56,290 --> 00:05:01,709
Happy birthday, darlings.

65
00:05:01,709 --> 00:05:04,709
Who wants a day on a fancy yacht with Mommy?

66
00:05:04,709 --> 00:05:07,709
It's docked and ready with a French feast already prepared.

67
00:05:07,709 --> 00:05:08,709
Who's hungry?

68
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:10,709
I don't want you here.

69
00:05:10,709 --> 00:05:11,709
Leave us alone.

70
00:05:11,709 --> 00:05:19,310
Oh my gosh.

71
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:22,699
Yeah, but we didn't pay her any attention.

72
00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:27,899
But she's their mother.

73
00:05:27,899 --> 00:05:30,819
She was no mother at all.

74
00:05:30,819 --> 00:05:32,560
She was never around.

75
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:41,910
You aren't.

76
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:42,910
You guys aren't my children.

77
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:47,540
Whether you're a biologic or not, I love you both.

78
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:50,180
Always love you.

79
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:54,699
And that's what makes a family.

80
00:05:54,699 --> 00:06:13,750
Love.

81
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,540
You were ice.

82
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:20,389
What?

83
00:06:20,389 --> 00:06:23,620
How many times do I have to tell you to stop spending money?

84
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,870
No, I didn't drop a dime.

85
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:31,980
I got to be collecting shells and my pounds and pearls.

86
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,399
Fine.

87
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:34,399
Yeah, we put it on.

88
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:53,540
It's beautiful.

89
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:59,860
But I'll come down to the necklace.

90
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,019
Neither.

91
00:07:01,019 --> 00:07:10,110
I'm so glad that you'd rely on me about going to your parents.

92
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:12,500
I just wanted to make you happy.

93
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:16,990
I hate dishonesty.

94
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:19,990
I want to build truths between us.

95
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:24,500
I want to build trust between us.

96
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,500
Good?

97
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:29,500
So, if you liked me ever again,

98
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:40,459
I would have pushed you harder than you've ever been.

99
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:42,459
Thought I might find you in here.

100
00:07:42,459 --> 00:07:44,620
It's a matter, bro.

101
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:47,160
You scared me?

102
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,160
We'll get you searching for the meaning of life.

103
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,610
What's on your mind?

104
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:54,269
I can't keep it a secret anymore.

105
00:07:54,269 --> 00:07:56,269
I got to be honest with her.

106
00:07:56,269 --> 00:07:59,850
Okay, but you have to be tactful.

107
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:02,129
Okay?

108
00:08:02,129 --> 00:08:04,189
How do I do that?

109
00:08:04,189 --> 00:08:08,189
In my experience, you start by telling her or sneezing or sneezing.

110
00:08:08,189 --> 00:08:10,189
That way we can tell the real news.

111
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:12,189
It doesn't seem that bad.

112
00:08:12,189 --> 00:08:13,189
Okay.

113
00:08:13,189 --> 00:08:21,810
What could be worse than your husband lying to you and everyone else being in on it?

114
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:22,810
Useless.

115
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:27,399
Okay, how about this?

116
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:32,500
You start by telling her you've been diagnosed with a terminal illness and you've got like 10 days left to live.

117
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,500
On the bright side, you're a billionaire.

118
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,500
Her and the kids won't hear everything.

119
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,169
Yeah.

120
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:44,440
As I said before, useless.

121
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:48,570
You're so sharp with business, but you don't know the first thing about romance.

122
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,080
How about this?

123
00:08:50,080 --> 00:09:02,799
You speak from your heart.

124
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:04,799
Hey, Christina.

125
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:06,990
I need to talk to you.

126
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:13,860
You need me to toss a hotel tonight.

127
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,860
So, what do you want to tell her?

128
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:18,490
The truth?

129
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:22,899
If I keep lying through her, she'll divorce me.

130
00:09:22,899 --> 00:09:23,899
Got to be honest.

131
00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:34,440
You're just quite nice.

132
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,440
Going somewhere?

133
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,299
What do you want, Emma?

134
00:09:39,299 --> 00:09:41,299
That is a nice necklace.

135
00:09:41,299 --> 00:09:45,299
Oxygen that saw at the last month by the Austrian royal family, I believe.

136
00:09:45,299 --> 00:09:48,360
He must have spent a lot of money on that.

137
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,389
I don't have time to listen to you.

138
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:52,389
I have somewhere to be.

139
00:09:52,389 --> 00:09:58,389
Even if I said your husband is really Ethan Parker and he's been lying to you since the beginning.

140
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:16,700
He didn't have the children involved in his little lie. Isn't that crazy?

141
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:22,200
So, he was the one who sabotaged my job.

142
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,200
He did whatever he could do appease me.

143
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,460
I'm sorry it had to be you.

144
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:51,200
I want a divorce.

145
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:56,169
I want a divorce.

146
00:10:56,169 --> 00:10:57,330
What?

147
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:58,740
Why?

148
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:03,570
You've lied to me the entire time.

149
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:09,870
Your monthly salary, your job, even your parents.

150
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:12,870
What were you afraid that I was in poor gold digger?

151
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,419
Who told you?

152
00:11:14,419 --> 00:11:22,419
No, no, but I mean, yes, but I can explain.

153
00:11:22,419 --> 00:11:24,419
You couldn't just ruin my career.

154
00:11:24,419 --> 00:11:26,419
You had to go and ruin my whole life.

155
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:27,419
No, Christina.

156
00:11:27,419 --> 00:11:28,419
I didn't know any about the competition.

157
00:11:28,419 --> 00:11:29,419
I swear.

158
00:11:29,419 --> 00:11:31,740
Okay, please, you've just got to believe me, okay?

159
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,740
I mean, I can explain everything.

160
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:45,789
If you lied about your own name, how am I supposed to believe anything else you sang?

161
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:46,789
I'll enjoy your night, Ethan.

162
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:58,929
Yeah, please.

163
00:11:58,929 --> 00:11:59,929
I'll give you anything.

164
00:11:59,929 --> 00:12:01,929
Anything but a divorce.

165
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:04,340
There's no going back.

166
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,340
I don't care.

167
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:08,460
I've already packed the luggage.

168
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,460
It's dark outside.

169
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,659
It's an unsafe to go outside alone.

170
00:12:11,659 --> 00:12:16,500
I won't let you leave.

171
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,820
Who said I was the one leaving?

172
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:19,820
This is your luggage.

173
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:38,169
Or dish soap?

174
00:12:38,169 --> 00:12:40,169
You have gone ahead.

175
00:12:40,169 --> 00:12:42,169
Absolutely mad, my friend.

176
00:12:42,169 --> 00:12:44,169
What are you doing doing housework?

177
00:12:44,169 --> 00:12:46,169
Don't you have a parent teacher gone from CO2?

178
00:12:46,169 --> 00:12:47,299
Christina's gonna be there?

179
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:48,299
Go.

180
00:12:48,299 --> 00:12:49,299
You might catch her in time.

181
00:12:49,299 --> 00:12:50,299
No.

182
00:12:50,299 --> 00:12:54,299
No, if I go, she will make me send a divorce papers.

183
00:12:54,299 --> 00:12:56,389
I'm not going.

184
00:12:56,389 --> 00:13:16,600
School of Reject returns.

185
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,600
Hmm.

186
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,629
It says the one who failed all our exams.

187
00:13:19,629 --> 00:13:26,460
If your father didn't donate money to the building, you wouldn't have even graduated.

188
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:30,259
We all know about your plagiarism scandal.

189
00:13:30,259 --> 00:13:33,259
I just have the adoption to share your face.

190
00:13:33,259 --> 00:13:35,769
I have nothing to prove to you.

191
00:13:35,769 --> 00:13:41,399
Ms. Hayes, I didn't expect to see you here.

192
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:43,399
I heard you're getting a divorce.

193
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:44,399
Yes.

194
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:45,590
I am.

195
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:50,389
And if you want my sloppy seconds, he's all yours.

196
00:13:50,389 --> 00:13:58,620
Welcome, esteemed graduates of the University of Arts and Design.

197
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,679
I have a surprise announcement I'd like to make.

198
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:04,679
But first, allow me to introduce you to a special guest.

199
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:11,129
CEO and chairman of the Parker Corporation, Mr. Ethan Parker.

200
00:14:11,129 --> 00:14:23,460
Dean Ethan Parker.

201
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,460
He looks so handsome a person.

202
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,460
Why is he here though?

203
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:33,460
Ethan was last reported to have been married to Anna Ellis before they had the twins.

204
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,460
He's clearly here to support his ex-wife.

205
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,460
Really?

206
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,460
Even after the divorce?

207
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,750
That must be true, Bob.

208
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:47,850
Years ago, our school received a generous donation from Miss Honeywell's family that became the foundation of our design program.

209
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:54,879
And now, our school will truly be the best and most complete design school in the country, if not the world.

210
00:14:54,879 --> 00:15:07,879
I have the great pleasure to announce that the Parker Family Trust has just donated $1.2 billion to allow us to build our new state-of-the-art fashion design building.

211
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:13,100
Allow me to introduce the Christina Hayes School of Design coming next year.

212
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:20,259
Mr. Parker, I believe you have a theme of remarks.

213
00:15:20,259 --> 00:15:34,730
Your family trust my installation because we believe that Miss Hayes is the greatest designer of your generation.

214
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:38,049
But she copied your wife's work.

215
00:15:38,049 --> 00:15:41,620
That scandal was completely unfounded.

216
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,820
And I've prepared a statement.

217
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:51,580
This was a serious mistake made by a junior staffer, Lake Parker Corporation of Subsidaries.

218
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:57,649
And we sincerely apologize to Miss Hayes, framed Sufferin's as cause for over the years.

219
00:15:57,649 --> 00:16:10,940
In the future, Lake Parker Family Trust will continue to support Miss Hayes and her designs and will allocate another million dollars to open a scholarship in her name to support future designers for the upcoming generation.

220
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:13,940
You aren't really going to reward that cheater, are you?

221
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:22,259
If anyone has any objections, we are willing to reopen the scandal for investigation.

222
00:16:22,259 --> 00:16:24,259
You really are cruel, Ethan.

223
00:16:24,259 --> 00:16:28,279
I don't think I can take it anymore.

224
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:38,440
Well, we really have a way with women.

225
00:16:38,440 --> 00:17:01,610
It's having a rich hour for a bunch of husbands. Pretty nice, isn't it?

226
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:03,740
You're joking, right?

227
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:04,740
You're no hero.

228
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:27,809
And we weren't for you, I wouldn't have to be saved in the first place.

229
00:17:27,809 --> 00:17:45,130
You're right.

230
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,960
You're ankle sore.

231
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,960
Look as wise.

232
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:48,960
We're out of ice.

233
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,220
Then I'll go get some.

234
00:17:51,220 --> 00:18:06,740
You don't like it.

235
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:10,180
I'm going to show you why you shouldn't.

236
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:14,529
When I get home, I do the chores.

237
00:18:14,529 --> 00:18:16,259
For laundry.

238
00:18:16,259 --> 00:18:18,259
For floors.

239
00:18:18,259 --> 00:18:19,259
I wash dishes.

240
00:18:19,259 --> 00:18:25,559
And then I go upstairs and I lie next to you.

241
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:34,240
Please.

242
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,269
Don't divorce me.

243
00:18:36,269 --> 00:18:41,750
What's the meaning of this?

244
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:46,099
This is not even a second of a purchase leading to a dark future.

245
00:18:46,099 --> 00:18:54,430
That is, you didn't pay the power.

246
00:18:54,430 --> 00:19:00,579
Now go do it.

247
00:19:00,579 --> 00:19:13,019
Does this mean you don't look at me?

248
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:32,900
It's eagerly anticipating the upcoming wedding of Ethan Parker and Christina Hayes.

249
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:36,900
With the big day, just a few days away, the city is a bond.

250
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:37,900
This is all your fault.

251
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,900
I'm going to make you pay for a suffering.

252
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:46,900
The city and Christina Hayes are set to exchange vows in what promises to be a spectacular event.

253
00:19:46,900 --> 00:20:43,519
Can you bother her?

254
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:50,539
We think it's leukemia.

255
00:20:50,539 --> 00:20:53,539
Don't worry, we're going to test her bone marrow as he even matches his.

256
00:20:53,539 --> 00:20:55,980
And I'll contact other hospitals as well.

257
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:58,690
Should we get more than a tester as well?

258
00:20:58,690 --> 00:20:59,690
Yes.

259
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:02,069
Some things have a higher chance of a match.

260
00:21:02,069 --> 00:21:19,170
There's no match.

261
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:23,509
Hang on the registry, but it could take some time.

262
00:21:23,509 --> 00:21:31,019
Is there anything else we can do to help him?

263
00:21:31,019 --> 00:21:32,019
There's always another way.

264
00:21:32,019 --> 00:21:33,019
What do you want?

265
00:21:33,019 --> 00:21:35,630
To save my son.

266
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:37,630
What do you suggest?

267
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,700
Marry me.

268
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:43,819
We have another child together and they can be tested for a bone marrow transplant.

269
00:21:43,819 --> 00:21:44,819
What?

270
00:21:44,819 --> 00:21:45,819
Are you crazy?

271
00:21:45,819 --> 00:21:47,980
I will never marry you.

272
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:57,269
We're just going to wait and hope that something pops up on the registry.

273
00:21:57,269 --> 00:21:59,259
Hello?

274
00:21:59,259 --> 00:22:03,940
Speaking.

275
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:04,940
Thank you.

276
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,390
What is it?

277
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:07,390
Somebody responded.

278
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:09,390
We have a match.

279
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:21,700
How do you feel, sweetie?

280
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:22,700
Have you found Mommy?

281
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:25,700
Well just think about my birthday for next year.

282
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:28,700
Let's do it right without that Mom around.

283
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:29,700
Of course.

284
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,700
What the end do you want?

285
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:37,269
A princess thing become my sister of the princess and my mom of the princess too.

286
00:22:37,269 --> 00:22:43,180
You'll always be Mommy's little prince.

287
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:45,759
You look like you can use another coat.

288
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:47,759
Let me go see if they have one.

289
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:54,359
I came for you.

290
00:22:54,359 --> 00:22:58,380
I've got a sick child that's very fragile.

291
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:01,799
This is not the type that lives with me.

292
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:05,799
Five years ago I got a hold of Mr. Maynard's video from about all that.

293
00:23:05,799 --> 00:23:12,019
If you then finds out that you got pregnant by a stranger and you think you can still marry into the prestigious family,

294
00:23:12,019 --> 00:23:14,019
I won't change anything.

295
00:23:14,019 --> 00:23:15,630
Fine.

296
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:18,630
Let's see how long you can keep up this tough girl.

297
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:38,460
Be with someone else to cancel the banquet.

298
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:43,680
You aren't dreaming of marrying into the Parker family's about to crumble.

299
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:50,339
Finish watching.

300
00:23:50,339 --> 00:23:53,950
We met marrying someone with such a past.

301
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:56,559
I don't care about her past.

302
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:58,559
I love who she is now.

303
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:01,099
And it seems like you never learned your lesson.

304
00:24:01,099 --> 00:24:05,319
Mark, get her out of here.

305
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:06,319
No!

306
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:07,579
Stop!

307
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:08,579
Please!

308
00:24:08,579 --> 00:24:09,579
Let me go!

309
00:24:09,579 --> 00:24:10,930
Stop!

310
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:11,930
Let me go!

311
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:12,930
Let me go!

312
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:16,779
His Mark canceled the wedding.

313
00:24:16,779 --> 00:24:17,779
I fell asleep at home.

314
00:24:17,779 --> 00:24:20,140
That night at the buzz of the hotel.

315
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:22,140
I was there too.

316
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:23,710
I was confused.

317
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:24,710
I was Hannah.

318
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:25,710
But...

319
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:27,839
It was actually you.

320
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:29,130
Me?

321
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:31,500
Me?

322
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,500
Of course.

323
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,500
Which is why.

324
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,500
Every time.

325
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:37,500
This is a DNA test on Mason and Melinda.

326
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:44,000
The parents said you have one that's Mason and Melinda.

327
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,150
But I thought I was supposed to have two boys.

328
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:53,430
Well, the parents lied.

329
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:55,559
You were born a girl.

330
00:24:55,559 --> 00:24:57,660
Wait, so...

331
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:00,660
Mason and Melinda are my biological children?

332
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:01,880
Yep.

333
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:06,930
And I'm never gonna let anybody hurt you ever again.

334
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:16,539
What's the matter?

335
00:25:16,539 --> 00:25:20,460
Well, tell me you're pregnant again from the other night.

336
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:39,970
Well, I mean, I have some important tell you.

337
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:47,609
So, my birthday is coming up.

338
00:25:47,609 --> 00:25:50,990
And on that day, five years ago...

339
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:54,990
I gave birth to a set of twins.

340
00:25:54,990 --> 00:26:01,089
Oh, a story short.

341
00:26:01,089 --> 00:26:04,279
Mommy is actually your biological mommy.

342
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:06,279
Well, duh.

343
00:26:06,279 --> 00:26:10,920
So, since we all share the same birthday,

344
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,920
who's up for a princess party?

345
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,920
Does that mean we got more presents?

346
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,920
Yes, of course.

347
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:29,900
And gentlemen, he's welcome.

348
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:32,279
The beautiful bride.

349
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:45,410
Where's your brother?

350
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:55,029
He said he turned into an angel.

351
00:26:55,029 --> 00:26:58,539
Mason, just because you're better doesn't mean you won't get a spank.

352
00:26:58,539 --> 00:26:59,539
Oh, come on.

353
00:26:59,539 --> 00:27:00,539
You're okay.

354
00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:06,000
Do not hit that chart.

355
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:15,809
May you wonder,

356
00:27:15,809 --> 00:27:17,809
encountering love and beauty,

357
00:27:17,809 --> 00:27:19,809
may you have a home to return to,

358
00:27:19,809 --> 00:27:21,809
someone waiting,

359
00:27:21,809 --> 00:27:22,809
food team,

360
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:25,809
a lamp left on, just for you.
