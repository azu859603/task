00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.980
Pull me out of the door and you'll know if I'll get down.

2
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.779
You're the one who's still alive.

3
00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:12.919
We'll have to go to the other side.

4
00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:14.980
Let's go to the other side.

5
00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:17.710
Let's go to the other side.

6
00:00:17.829 --> 00:00:20.530
I'm not going to die.

7
00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:23.250
I'm not going to die, I'm not going to die.

8
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.920
Do you think you're going to die?

9
00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.280
I'm not going to die.

10
00:00:29.719 --> 00:00:31.780
I'm going to die.

11
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.740
I'm not going to die.

12
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.399
But that's not the point of the story.

13
00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.369
I can't trust you.

14
00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:50.810
I can never trust you now.

15
00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.170
I can't believe you.

16
00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:56.020
You can't trust me.

17
00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:08.939
Let me tell you that I'm not.

18
00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:10.000
You can't believe.

19
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.719
It's not that you are in the area.

20
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.599
I'm not going to answer that question.

21
00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:31.969
But I'm not going to tell you that.
