00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.660
I will be able to believe someone.

2
00:00:02.859 --> 00:00:13.140
And then I will be able to believe that you are a one.

3
00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:14.380
Gracias!

4
00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:16.739
I am at the greater spot.

5
00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.100
I am lucky.

6
00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:23.440
And I want to see you as my mentor.

7
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.359
It is much fun.

8
00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:28.179
I'm very lucky to see you.

9
00:00:28.379 --> 00:00:29.300
Gracias!

10
00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:30.059
I am not an artist.

11
00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:45.039
A guy, a little...

12
00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:46.560
I don't care how round journey for me

13
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.240
so much, Little

14
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.619
I can tell you

15
00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:51.659
what area to shop

16
00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:52.859
I want you

17
00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:56.799
but it's something

18
00:00:56.799 --> 00:01:00.039
Randy and Casa gave us

19
00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:01.789
and what will you do with Edo's Mother?

20
00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:03.009
Carlos

21
00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:03.929
Would you like to paint it on her dress?

22
00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:04.489
Yes

23
00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:05.730
I think it's all about Grace

24
00:01:06.489 --> 00:01:07.930
Is this how it looks like with Edo, Petamade

25
00:01:08.849 --> 00:01:09.650
Did you have oil?

26
00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.340
Pretty even

27
00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.340
A lot...

28
00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:16.680
very beautiful

29
00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:17.739
Mama

30
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.900
What I hate

31
00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.000
See

32
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.359
I'm not going to play better than you.

33
00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:27.260
But I'm not going to.

34
00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.439
I'm not going to play better.

35
00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:34.709
It's not true.

36
00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:39.219
I'm not going to play better.

37
00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:42.400
Did you know that?

38
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.400
Yes.

39
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.790
I'm going to be playing with you.
