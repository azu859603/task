1
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:11,560
This is some of my stuff.

2
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:28,449
I'll be in the inside first.

3
00:00:28,449 --> 00:00:30,539
What is it?

4
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:31,539
It's ok.

5
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:33,539
I don't know it.

6
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:35,659
What?

7
00:00:35,659 --> 00:00:36,659
I'm not going to check.

8
00:00:36,659 --> 00:00:40,700
I think not.

9
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:41,700
It's OK.

10
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:42,700
That's what happened.

11
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,850
Whatever.

12
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,850
It's OK.

13
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:47,850
I just never seen it.

14
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,850
I think it's OK.

15
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:50,850
It's OK.

16
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:56,090
I don't want to see it.

17
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:57,090
What?

18
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,570
Who?

19
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:00,950
Oh, I respect theseying papers.

20
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:04,629
We have been in the area, not for us to be in the area,

21
00:01:04,909 --> 00:01:07,870
but for some reason, we have anything to do with the city.

22
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:11,030
We have been in the city for a long time,

23
00:01:11,269 --> 00:01:14,909
and we have been to the city for a long time,

24
00:01:15,269 --> 00:01:18,390
and this is the city of the city.

25
00:01:18,629 --> 00:01:19,670
It's a big city.

26
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:28,299
I don't think it's a big city.

27
00:01:29,819 --> 00:01:30,900
I don't think we need to.

28
00:01:31,689 --> 00:01:33,689
Do you think you would have a lot of hope for me?

29
00:01:33,849 --> 00:01:37,409
I think we have all these problems.

30
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:41,010
I think we need to have more.

31
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:45,280
We are now in the world of the world,

32
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,280
and we are now in the world of the world.

33
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,500
We are now in the world of the world.
