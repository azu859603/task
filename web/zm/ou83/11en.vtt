00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.070
And thank you.

2
00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:42.549
I must be here, I will be here, I will be here.

3
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.250
Yes, and he was nine.

4
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.670
What is this?

5
00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:59.579
What?

6
00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.840
Yes, and he was nine.

7
00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:11.300
No, it's not your fault.

8
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:19.139
But it's not your fault, it's your fault.

9
00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:21.139
You must be the first, you must be a one.

10
00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:27.400
Give me a say.

11
00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:28.699
Lucas!

12
00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:29.969
What are you doing?

13
00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:32.629
I don't know what your fault is.

14
00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:35.629
How would you find the way you're doing something new?

15
00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:38.990
But that is not the only one.

16
00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:41.870
What is the most important thing?

17
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.900
If you have a friend and a friend,

18
00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.580
you have a friend who will come to the next stage.

19
00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.900
What is the most important thing?

20
00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.500
Oh, the thing is,

21
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.759
no, the thing is,

22
00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:58.759
the thing is,

23
00:02:58.759 --> 00:03:00.759
the thing is,

24
00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:02.759
the thing is,

25
00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:04.759
the whole thing is,

26
00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:14.979
the thing is,

27
00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:37.770
If I was a school boy, I'd be like a girl, I'd be like a girl.

28
00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:39.770
You're a girl, don't you?

29
00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:45.770
I'm going to go back in the bathroom with you.

30
00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:54.389
I'm going to find one.

31
00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:58.060
S'a ree!

32
00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:06.199
And S'a ree!

33
00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:08.300
I'm going to go to Zechukinoteenie koszpadre.

34
00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:09.960
And I'm going to take you to Carla de Konoszerta.

35
00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:14.840
S'a ree!

36
00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.300
And S'a ree!

37
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:20.899
I'm going to go to Zechukinoteenie koszpadre.

38
00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:25.600
Er... reliers alpadreenoe de luchas.

39
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:32.189
Ser le gusta llamaar le pape.

40
00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:34.470
Gonna be a little more.

41
00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:35.889
I'm going to be a little more interested in the music.

42
00:05:39.459 --> 00:05:42.259
I'm going to try to get over everything for my friend.

43
00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.480
What do you do?

44
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.240
I got a link with them who are here and said,

45
00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.319
I want them to go out and make free of them.

46
00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:52.920
We got from the group and we got at the group of who are involved with them.

47
00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:55.110
I want to go fast.

48
00:05:56.259 --> 00:05:57.660
Oh, hi!

49
00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:00.149
Let's see what's going on.

50
00:06:00.149 --> 00:06:03.430
I wanted to go home to the family.

51
00:06:04.209 --> 00:06:06.370
I want to share with you some simple words –

52
00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:08.850
let's say you don't put under your clothes.

53
00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:13.579
Asese se se hai saines, aye?

54
00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:17.310
Ase se se hai saines, aye?

55
00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.550
P Lawson a mí discreción

56
00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:24.110
A bit oall gien des el azyñorita díseica

57
00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:28.089
No, no des centonces

58
00:06:28.089 --> 00:06:29.990
Nasra praviranochu

59
00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:32.519
Futen mahi ke

60
00:06:32.519 --> 00:06:35.509
No zieke de mon e osp aside

61
00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:53.199
Luca,qué as a qué la greada d'àve téverda

62
00:06:53.199 --> 00:06:57.439
Aile buen ki le cíñorita nít

63
00:06:57.439 --> 00:07:03.879
In this series, I have a new aspect called Sri Sajha.

64
00:07:03.879 --> 00:07:15.800
The most important thing is that I'm a problem of having a a dream.

65
00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.420
And that means that we don't even live in the city.

66
00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:23.459
And then in the forest, we have another element of the traditional purpose.

67
00:07:23.459 --> 00:07:36.699
This is the main topic of the universe.

68
00:07:36.699 --> 00:07:39.279
This is the human thing,

69
00:07:39.279 --> 00:07:41.319
this is the human thing.

70
00:07:41.319 --> 00:07:43.279
Then you come to have a new game.

71
00:07:43.279 --> 00:07:45.519
One's game is something you can't play with,

72
00:07:45.519 --> 00:07:57.069
because you have no chance of playing,

73
00:07:57.069 --> 00:07:58.790
or a new game.

74
00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:01.029
Because that doesn't mean the only thing you can always do.

75
00:08:01.029 --> 00:08:04.269
I want you to start playing the game as well as you can.

76
00:08:04.269 --> 00:08:07.129
If you were a little bit more like a crazy game,

77
00:08:07.129 --> 00:08:09.040
what would you do?

78
00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:10.509
Just because of this,

79
00:08:10.509 --> 00:08:14.379
I didn't really know what you could play with the game.

80
00:08:14.379 --> 00:08:17.480
I can't even play the game.

81
00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:18.980
That's right.

82
00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:21.800
It's all going to be something.

83
00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:24.060
I can't believe it, thank you.

84
00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:25.660
If you're not using this code,

85
00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:30.579
you will never miss a little.

86
00:08:30.579 --> 00:08:38.840
No, I'm not.

87
00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.179
You are dead and hurt.

88
00:08:40.179 --> 00:08:42.480
That was why you have killed him.

89
00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:47.690
I've been in trouble for seven years.

90
00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:49.649
But, I was here before.

91
00:08:49.649 --> 00:09:03.379
So how is the blood being found?

92
00:09:03.379 --> 00:09:07.580
Where are you?

93
00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:11.039
I can't.

94
00:09:11.039 --> 00:09:13.600
What is going on here?

95
00:09:16.659 --> 00:09:17.580
Do you have any room?

96
00:09:37.169 --> 00:09:37.990
I'm fine.

97
00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:40.570
How are you?

98
00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:59.090
I'm fine.

99
00:09:59.090 --> 00:09:59.190
It's very...

100
00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:00.769
It's very high.

101
00:10:00.769 --> 00:10:02.529
It is very high.

102
00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:04.419
I am fine.

103
00:10:04.899 --> 00:10:06.019
I'm fine.

104
00:10:17.639 --> 00:10:19.500
I'm fine, I'm fine.

105
00:10:21.879 --> 00:10:22.679
I'm fine.

106
00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:12.120
I'm fine, I'm fine.

107
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.720
I'm fine. You're fine.

108
00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:23.009
What are you doing here?

109
00:11:23.009 --> 00:11:23.710
I'm fine.

110
00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:24.809
I'm fine.

111
00:11:24.809 --> 00:11:30.100
Oh

112
00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:44.779
Can we make them?

113
00:12:44.779 --> 00:12:47.870
All right, let's do this.

114
00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:49.509
What is this?

115
00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:51.710
Can you tell me why are you here?

116
00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:54.840
I want to make them look like me!

117
00:12:56.799 --> 00:12:58.960
I want to make them looks like me!

118
00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:03.200
I want to make them look like you have been here.

119
00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:04.980
Yes!

120
00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:08.830
I want to make them look like you have been here,

121
00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:14.710
I want to make them look like you have been here for a long time.

122
00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:48.250
I'd like to say what I want to know about the family,

123
00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:50.730
Thank you very much!

124
00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:52.620
Do you know?

125
00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:56.700
There are different things to do.

126
00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:59.799
You can go to the store and leave your shop somewhere.

127
00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:04.330
The room is not inside my house,

128
00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:06.409
it's a residence for you.

129
00:14:11.529 --> 00:14:14.710
A public house lady would like a house to see as a house

130
00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:16.230
like a anticipate of that.

131
00:14:17.929 --> 00:14:20.850
Do you know what's a place where you and others

132
00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:22.309
can be hosting a great event,

133
00:14:22.309 --> 00:14:24.190
That's why I said the wrong word.

134
00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:26.909
I was a kid and I was a little bit older.

135
00:14:26.909 --> 00:14:29.470
I was a kid and I was very old.

136
00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:32.370
I said, I'm not a kid.

137
00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:34.289
I said, I'm not a kid.

138
00:14:34.289 --> 00:14:40.320
But I don't think that is an idea that I have to be a kid.

139
00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:41.720
I know that I'm a kid.

140
00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:44.860
Yes.

141
00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:59.580
I'm not a kid.

142
00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:01.740
I don't know how to say that.

143
00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:10.740
I'm a little bit more older.

144
00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:15.419
Oh, gracias, Joe, um, gracias, gracias.

183
00:18:11.049 --> 00:18:13.819
De bridges con cidera de Chejada del empreza.

184
00:18:13.819 --> 00:18:15.819
De que de gaga muy mientos players.

185

Es seora.

187
00:18:17.819 --> 00:18:20.819
No se por que tristanos betan amuendo.

188
00:18:20.819 --> 00:18:22.819
Camila strada de alvene.

189
00:18:22.819 --> 00:18:25.460
Se edes tu bore que lucka sít sui hoe.

190
00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:27.460
Paz estan hazygris prolemás.

191

193

Quien esaí.

194
00:18:36.599 --> 00:19:02.220
Ti alginessa scuti estas comos en gravis problímas.

195
00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:03.839
Mama, keep us up!

196
00:19:03.839 --> 00:19:12.230
Oh, everybody,

197
00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:13.509
it's the Lucas X.

198
00:19:14.950 --> 00:19:16.990
All I need is a fast sound,

199
00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:19.410
and this is the Lucas X.

200
00:19:20.369 --> 00:19:31.099
It's the Lucas X,

201
00:19:31.099 --> 00:19:33.880
it's the biggest thing that we've ever seen.

202
00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:34.400
I'm gonna say...

203
00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:37.000
The only reason why we have this is to solve...

204
00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.240
to solve it.

205
00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:40.829
Then...

206
00:19:40.829 --> 00:19:43.430
It's the same way we've been here in the Lucas X.

207
00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:45.710
But I'm not gonna take it back to the Lucas X.

208
00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:50.700
The previous one made us a little happy?

209
00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:52.460
Then, we have to say this.

210
00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:54.759
What are you doing with all of us here?

211
00:19:54.759 --> 00:19:57.740
I want to know the best I can find.

212
00:20:02.029 --> 00:20:18.000
Is this a significant phrase for me?

213
00:20:18.519 --> 00:20:20.440
I have to say this,

214
00:20:21.789 --> 00:20:24.150
which is the most difficult word in this video?

215
00:20:55.609 --> 00:20:57.609
Oh yes, no word on this song!

216
00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:08.759
This is not an extraordinary word.

217
00:21:08.759 --> 00:21:11.000
Do you feel like a really good farmer?

218
00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:11.700
Yes!

219
00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:14.240
You may be a great dude.

220
00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:19.319
You know he's about to go in, like a

221
00:21:19.319 --> 00:21:22.980
normal.

222
00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:29.980
The homesick is always very

223
00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:32.480
normal.

224
00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:33.779
It's all to be more normal than

225
00:21:33.779 --> 00:21:36.279
the animal over there.

226
00:21:36.279 --> 00:21:39.779
The animal is almost complete.

227
00:21:39.779 --> 00:21:41.460
The animal is very

228
00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:42.480
complete.

229
00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:44.480
That is the animal here.

230
00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:46.940
It's certainly not like that.

231
00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:50.660
Just a moment to look for other people.

232
00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:53.759
It's so beautiful in life.

233
00:21:53.759 --> 00:21:56.619
These people are looking forward to looking for more because of their life.

234
00:21:56.619 --> 00:22:03.210
She's a 15-year-old, and is looking forward to looking forward to something.

235
00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:07.200
I am all really thinking.

236
00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:15.920
Let alone the future.

237
00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:21.460
I'm about to ask her how you can speak.

238
00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:22.460
Yes!

239
00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:23.460
You can see it.

240
00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:25.460
I'm not sure, but I was able to find it.

241
00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:27.460
I was able to see everything.

242
00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:29.460
I'm not able to find it.

243
00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:30.460
I can't find it.

244
00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:33.220
I'm not able to find it.

245
00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:41.089
You're not able to find it.

246
00:22:41.089 --> 00:22:44.089
I'm not able to find it.

247
00:22:44.089 --> 00:22:46.089
I'm not able to find it.

248
00:22:46.089 --> 00:23:02.650
I'm not able to find it.

249
00:23:02.650 --> 00:23:04.650
Do you know what I mean?

250
00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:06.000
Yes.

251
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.000
Yes.

252
00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.150
I'm able to find it.

253
00:23:11.150 --> 00:23:18.460
Thanks for today's video.

254
00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:24.690
We're going to be playing American Canada on Thursday.

255
00:23:24.690 --> 00:23:30.210
Thursday, the Dallas, November 9th, 2010.

256
00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:31.809
What's the next of the show?

257
00:23:31.809 --> 00:23:35.700
The last day I was released.

258
00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:36.740
Right, right?

259
00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:40.200
Yeah, exactly, exactly.

260
00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:54.740
And here's what I got, and now I'm going to go.

261
00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:58.460
Mama, what's your favorite thing?

262
00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:01.460
And now we have to say, noIRNo.

263
00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:04.460
The fact that the music shows the music will be so beautiful.

264
00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:06.460
The music will be so beautiful.

265
00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:14.859
And I'll see you in the next video.

266
00:24:14.859 --> 00:24:18.859

...

327
00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:50.420
I will share her with me.

328
00:26:50.420 --> 00:27:18.019
You heard her?

329
00:27:18.019 --> 00:27:19.019
Yes.

330
00:27:19.019 --> 00:27:25.009
Look.

331
00:27:25.009 --> 00:27:30.940
Look.

332
00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:31.940
Look.

333
00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:37.990
Oh dear.

334
00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:39.309
What?

335
00:27:39.309 --> 00:27:41.309
If you want to listen to me now?

336
00:27:41.309 --> 00:27:43.369
Look.

337
00:27:43.369 --> 00:27:45.369
I think I can speak about you.

338
00:27:45.369 --> 00:27:47.069
Yes, I can speak?

339
00:27:47.069 --> 00:27:48.069
Yes.

340
00:27:48.069 --> 00:27:49.230
Oh.

341
00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:50.230
How much is there?

342
00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:51.230
I know a little bit more now.

343
00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:52.230
I know this is a different part of the world.

344
00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:54.230
You can hand this to me.

345
00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:55.230
The only way they are from.

346
00:27:55.230 --> 00:27:57.230
B skeptics are called by a man.

347
00:27:57.230 --> 00:28:00.079
It's not that easy to make a mistake...

348
00:28:00.079 --> 00:28:02.799
I don't know...

349
00:28:02.799 --> 00:28:03.839
Ok?

350
00:28:03.839 --> 00:28:05.759
I don't know why I didn't make a mistake.

351
00:28:05.759 --> 00:28:08.940
I was a little surprised by the way I was on the farm.

352
00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:10.579
And it was difficult to make.

353
00:28:10.579 --> 00:28:13.069
It's not too easy.

354
00:28:13.069 --> 00:28:18.539
I'm not even looking around.

355
00:28:18.539 --> 00:28:21.730
What's wrong?

356
00:28:21.730 --> 00:28:31.519
I don't know...

357
00:28:31.519 --> 00:28:33.779
Why do you want to make a mistake?

358
00:28:33.779 --> 00:28:35.509
No, no.

359
00:28:35.509 --> 00:28:37.099
No, no.

360
00:28:37.099 --> 00:28:38.940
It's not easy.

361
00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:41.099
I know, I'm sorry.

362
00:28:41.099 --> 00:28:43.099
My friend is killing me.

363
00:28:43.099 --> 00:28:47.279
No, no.

364
00:28:47.279 --> 00:28:49.279
Honey, don't hurt me.

365
00:28:49.279 --> 00:28:51.859
Don't hurt me.

366
00:28:51.859 --> 00:28:54.140
I'm not alone.

367
00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:56.140
No, no.

368
00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:59.200
What are you doing?

369
00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:01.359
No, no.

370
00:29:01.359 --> 00:29:03.359
I'm not alone.

371
00:29:03.359 --> 00:29:07.180
No, no, no.

372
00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:09.180
She's helping.

373
00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:11.410
No, no, no.

374
00:29:11.410 --> 00:29:13.410
No, no, no.

375
00:29:13.410 --> 00:29:15.410
It's okay, it's okay.

376
00:29:15.410 --> 00:29:30.369
It's not the spirit.

377
00:29:30.369 --> 00:29:37.660
Look, it's the first time I've ever seen a party.

378
00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:40.660
Lucas, you want to go to the jungle?

379
00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:42.819
I'll go to the jungle.

380
00:29:42.819 --> 00:29:43.819
No, no, it's not.

381
00:29:43.819 --> 00:29:47.329
I'll go to the jungle.

382
00:29:47.329 --> 00:29:56.240
I'll go to the jungle.

383
00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:58.549
Yes.

384
00:29:58.549 --> 00:30:04.869
I'll go to the jungle.

385
00:30:04.869 --> 00:30:06.869
I'll go to the jungle.

386
00:30:06.869 --> 00:30:09.640
I'll go to the jungle.

387
00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:12.220
I'll go to the jungle.

388
00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:14.950
We'll go to a house.

389
00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:19.930
Let's go to the jungle.

390
00:30:19.930 --> 00:30:21.930
All right, let's go to the jungle.

391
00:30:21.930 --> 00:30:28.059
Let's go to the jungle.

392
00:30:28.059 --> 00:30:31.920
All right, let's go to the jungle.

393
00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:34.240
Thank you, Lucas.

394
00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:37.660
Goodnight, Lucas.

395
00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:44.809
Now you're here for us.

396
00:30:44.809 --> 00:30:54.859
Hi, Lucas.

397
00:30:54.859 --> 00:30:55.859
Thank you.

398
00:30:55.859 --> 00:31:02.240
Thank you.

399
00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:13.200
I'm here for you.

400
00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:27.829
How are you?

401
00:31:27.829 --> 00:31:28.829
It's okay.

402
00:31:28.829 --> 00:31:32.549
Thank you.

403
00:31:32.549 --> 00:31:34.549
What's important here?

404
00:31:34.549 --> 00:31:36.839
They are now going to be coming here,

405
00:31:37.339 --> 00:31:39.339
and then you shall be born at home

406
00:31:39.339 --> 00:31:41.339
and by the end of time,

407
00:31:41.339 --> 00:31:50.640
the future will be the first day,

408
00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:54.140
and you will be the first day in the morning and so it will be like five days.

409
00:31:55.470 --> 00:31:59.970
I'm not sure that we will be there long enough so to have a chance to play in and out the road.

410
00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:02.660
Then we will be here on this hill.

411
00:32:04.089 --> 00:32:06.589
I'm going to tell you something about that,

412
00:32:06.589 --> 00:32:13.230
and that I'll tell you about it,

413
00:32:13.230 --> 00:32:17.309
be there and we will be there before.

414
00:32:17.309 --> 00:32:18.309
Much like that,

415
00:32:18.309 --> 00:32:19.309
but you have good friends,

416
00:32:19.309 --> 00:32:36.220
The

417
00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:55.990
the

418
00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:59.180
Hm, I don't know why.

419
00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:01.180
I don't know.

420
00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:03.400
I don't know why.

421
00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:05.400
No, I don't.

422
00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:07.400
I don't know why.

423
00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:08.400
Hey.

424
00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:09.400
Sorry.

425
00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:11.460
I've been here since I was here.

426
00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:14.069
I don't know why.

427
00:33:14.069 --> 00:33:16.069
You're not here.

428
00:33:16.069 --> 00:33:17.069
No.

429
00:33:17.069 --> 00:33:19.069
You don't know why.

430
00:33:19.069 --> 00:33:21.069
I don't know why.

431
00:33:21.069 --> 00:33:22.069
When I was here,

432
00:33:22.069 --> 00:33:24.069
I was here because I was here.

433
00:33:24.069 --> 00:33:26.069
I was here because I met him.

434
00:33:26.069 --> 00:33:31.839
As this could be, you have to be in Cecostrolucus and tell you that Rapamos are Cecostradors, ain't ya?
