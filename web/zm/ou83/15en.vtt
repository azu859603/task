00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:18.269
Hmm, sorry, no choice.

2
00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:19.829
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

3
00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:24.289
Laura, it's not too bad.

4
00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:32.399
Laura, before being able to go to the arab with the RC.

5
00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:38.810
Can I give you a snack?

6
00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.670
Can I give you a snack?

7
00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.100
I don't know.

8
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.350
You could be from a local Baptist or a localist.

9
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.909
No matter what, a localist?

10
00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:57.740
I'm absolutely sorry, if I read the voice Signe and the Lucas.

11
00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.359
It doesn't matter.

12
00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:04.040
I'm going to show you what I can do and how I can do.

13
00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:07.219
I'm going to help you with the Paris.

14
00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:11.420
I'm going to show you what I can do.

15
00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.299
But I can do it.

16
00:01:16.489 --> 00:01:18.290
I can do it.

17
00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:20.930
I can do it.

18
00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:24.430
I'll show you what I can do.

19
00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.989
I don't know what the Paris, you know?

20
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.829
No, I don't know.

21
00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:40.000
It's been a long time since I've been here for a long time since I've been here since I've been here for a long time
