1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,960
But it is not going to do anything.

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:05,320
Time to go back.

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:06,860
All around you.

4
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:14,599
No problem.

5
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:16,230
All right?

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:17,750
I told Mar Gole to his car,

7
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,719
and I wasn't afraid.

8
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:23,440
But how can you take my car?

9
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:30,940
I think he will be the enemy.

10
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:33,479
But when you have a bond,

11
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:35,799
you will simply be a normal person.

12
00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:36,920
The first thing is,

13
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:37,960
Tekin,

14
00:00:39,009 --> 00:00:40,750
what are you doing here?

15
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:48,439
But even if you were a mother, you would mean if you were not looking for your father.

16
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:53,090
Are you looking for the love I have?

17
00:00:53,659 --> 00:00:58,530
No, even if you were not in the house.

18
00:00:58,969 --> 00:01:02,130
I was a son of a son of a son.

19
00:01:03,609 --> 00:01:06,329
What about you, you must be like this?

20
00:01:07,819 --> 00:01:11,799
A son of a son of a son of a son of a son?

21
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,980
I was adulthood.

22
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:25,680
No, I'm sorry.

23
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,680
This is the second course, the very most of the day.

24
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:38,890
So, you're the very most special in your identity?

25
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:39,890
You're great.

26
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:48,120
You're the most?

27
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,120
No, it's the best.

28
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,120
You're the best.

29
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,120
You're the best.

30
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,120
You're the best.

31
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,120
You're the best.

32
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,120
You're the best.

33
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,120
You're the best.
