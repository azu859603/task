00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:13.169
It's not a problem, but I would like to say...

2
00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:27.660
I'm a professor of law, but I'm not a professor of law.

3
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.660
But this is what is going on,

4
00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.880
because it's a really interesting,

5
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:41.859
so I'll say the most important thing is...

6
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.060
...Mosa!

7
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.210
Just before we move to the future...

8
00:00:49.210 --> 00:01:19.420
Yes, but it's a good thing that we thought of as a kind of CD and a

9
00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.500
It's the same thing that everyone can do.

10
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.530
I'm not a fan of this.

11
00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.049
I'm not a fan of these three-person terms.

12
00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.010
We are a director of the group of terms.

13
00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:39.209
We then have the speed of the La Senorita Jessica Wilson.

14
00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:41.890
The La Senorita and the La Senorita Wilson

15
00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.549
are more than one director of the venue.

16
00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.840
What do you think, Mr. Coming?

17
00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.640
I'm a fan of the music.
