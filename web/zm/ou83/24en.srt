1
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:15,300
I could have read the word, but I didn't know what to do.

2
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:24,320
Yes, I had to know, and I was able to say that it was extremely similar.

3
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:33,369
I knew that it was a very big one, and I didn't know anything about it.

4
00:00:33,369 --> 00:00:38,200
You know, this is what I was talking about.

5
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,179
This one is a greedy man.

6
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:44,380
This is a makmodo.

7
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:46,899
He is not an innocent man.

8
00:00:46,899 --> 00:00:48,679
This is the father of the population.

9
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,920
This is the father of the population.

10
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:57,109
This is an honor to hold this country.

11
00:00:57,189 --> 00:01:08,969
This is an honor to take care of the population.

12
00:01:09,209 --> 00:01:20,459
That is defined as the poor men.

13
00:01:20,459 --> 00:01:50,810
I don't know if it's possible for the people to look out.

14
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:54,189
I'm a little bit nervous.

15
00:01:54,189 --> 00:01:56,319
It's going to be too cold.

16
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:58,319
It's going to be hot.

17
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:00,319
It's going to be so hot.

18
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:03,599
I'm feeling very happy.

19
00:02:04,629 --> 00:02:07,629
I'm going to hear some of this.

20
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:12,979
That's going to be the end of the TV.
