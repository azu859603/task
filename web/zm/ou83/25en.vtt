00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:11.230
Paul, are you ready to say something?

2
00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:19.359
As soon as I go out there, I have the right to do this.

3
00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:25.760
I have the right to do this, so no one can go with me.

4
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.179
As soon as I go out there, I have the right to do this.

5
00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:30.420
I'm not going to do that.

6
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.420
I'm not going anywhere.

7
00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:32.719
Or maybe I can do that.

8
00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:33.479
I had to get back to a house.

9
00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:34.679
We want you to go out there.

10
00:00:34.679 --> 00:00:35.619
I have the right to do this.

11
00:00:35.619 --> 00:00:36.619
Something into that.

12
00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:37.689
This will be fast.

13
00:00:37.689 --> 00:00:43.740
Sorry, that was close, that was a very difficult time.

14
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.060
How long have you been playing?

15
00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:49.539
You've never seen the last few years when the first time I even played,

16
00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:52.579
I've never been playing for a long time.

17
00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:54.740
How long have you been playing?

18
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.479
I've got to get it.

19
00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:01.079
What's your problem?

20
00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.340
I don't think I'm going to be playing.

21
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.870
How long have you been playing all over?

22
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.730
It's been a long time.

23
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.000
I've been playing all over all over the world.

24
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.120
You were that?

25
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:24.079
Mm-hm.

26
00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:25.040
You were that?

27
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.750
Yeah, you were that?

28
00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.079
You were that?

29
00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.799
Dot no, don't say that, focus.

30
00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:34.859
The next one makes it harder.

31
00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:35.200
What?

32
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.579
The next one is harder.

33
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.239
What is that?

34
00:01:38.239 --> 00:01:39.859
Is this the last one?

35
00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:41.500
Did you think it was too big?

36
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:47.799
Did youTubilit be a great fan of it?

37
00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:50.180
The last one is pretty awesome.

38
00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.980
The last one will be good at this time.

39
00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.299
No, no, no, to the other one.

40
00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.359
That's why I said that.
