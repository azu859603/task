00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.560
I don't know why this is my fault.

2
00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:18.070
I need to get a lot of money.

3
00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:23.539
I need to learn more about this.

4
00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:28.550
I can't, I'm sorry.

5
00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.839
I need to learn more about this.

6
00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:35.079
I know.

7
00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:39.380
I don't know.

8
00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:44.130
I don't know.

9
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:45.130
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:46.130
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:52.799
I'm sorry for that.

12
00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:55.820
You're sorry.

13
00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:56.820
I've never seen you.

14
00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.009
You're sorry.

15
00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:03.009
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:06.439
I'm sorry.

17
00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:21.599
We've totally already tried one of the employed class as the first class, as it's a matter of

18
00:01:21.599 --> 00:01:22.599
taste of tea.

19
00:01:22.599 --> 00:01:28.040
So, when you come to all the classes, you can read the results and read the results

20
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.920
of it, which shows how your class is.

21
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.959
This is where this class was, where the class is.

22
00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:38.599
Now you can learn from your class and get you to learn from the class.

23
00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:52.840
Now once you come to the class, you can read the results that allow yourself to see results.
