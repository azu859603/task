1
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:06,750
What's the point?

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,320
Oh, actually, every time it's around,

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,330
I'll find more habitats in the air

4
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:13,550
simply as a lake where the water is

5
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:15,390
and the water occurs in the air

6
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:15,849
and all of a sudden,

7
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:18,469
the water is in the air

8
00:00:18,469 --> 00:00:18,890
and all of a sudden,

9
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:21,300
and it's cold.

10
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,359
The water is cool,

11
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:23,000
and all of a sudden,

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,329
the water is in the air

13
00:00:26,329 --> 00:00:28,309
and the water is in the air

14
00:00:28,309 --> 00:00:30,399
and all of a sudden,

15
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:30,940
and of course,

16
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:35,500
I'll most likely assume

17
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,520
that everything that I have

18
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,039
in my mind,

19
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,000
is safe enough.

20
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,000
The water is Teacher's

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:01:03,520
I have a

22
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:15,519
It's that whole group that I have and I've never been a kid, but I've always been a kid.

23
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:22,549
I've always been like a kid with my friends and I've never been a kid, and I've never been in that group.

24
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:26,439
I've never been a kid with my friends, and I've never been a kid.
