1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,700
I feel like that I'm a little honest but I'm not happy.

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:09,750
It's like...

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:13,429
I can't believe that I'm a sister who really knows.

4
00:00:13,429 --> 00:00:16,539
I'm just a little so happy.

5
00:00:16,539 --> 00:00:19,260
I'm so glad that I've become a woman.

6
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,800
I'm so happy that I've been so happy.

7
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,199
I'm so happy that I'm a little too.

8
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:33,810
I know that I'm a little bit of a little more happy.

9
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:36,369
I'm not a little too happy.

10
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:37,530
I'm a little too happy.

11
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,729
I was not sure if you told me that you're all going to be serious.

12
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:41,549
You can't give up all this money.

13
00:00:46,509 --> 00:00:49,229
I know that's why I wanted to know that.

14
00:00:49,229 --> 00:00:50,950
I'm so sorry to say that you are a good person.

15
00:00:51,859 --> 00:00:54,859
I want to tell you this question.

16
00:00:56,179 --> 00:00:58,409
I have no more power.

17
00:00:58,409 --> 00:01:00,750
I want to know that you are a good person.

18
00:01:01,189 --> 00:01:15,349
I want to tell you that I'm not a bad person.

19
00:01:15,349 --> 00:01:19,409
I want you to know that you are not in a bitch and you are lied to.

20
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:32,180
In the last few years, I decided to do something with the money that you can do.

21
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:35,680
I got the money to go to the store, and I'll do something.

22
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,439
That's it!

23
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:43,439
I'm glad that you didn't present the opportunity for this opportunity.

24
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:49,560
I was like a friend of mine who died and I was like a hero and I was like a hero.

25
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,560
I was like a hero and I was like a hero.

26
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:57,879
I'm not a hero, I was like a hero, I was like a hero.

27
00:01:57,879 --> 00:02:02,310
But that's what it is every time the torture of the past,

28
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:06,780
and this whole process will continue for me.

29
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:30,169
I have to return a moment of significance.

30
00:02:30,169 --> 00:02:33,680
I know the difference in this matter,

31
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:40,830
but it's something I't really can write.

32
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:43,770
I do not know how it's present,

33
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:46,229
but it's still a moment,

34
00:02:46,229 --> 00:02:51,129
one of the reason why the lie is important...

35
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:54,129
protection, protection, excitosis, always.

36
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:58,449
I need to be able to

37
00:02:58,449 --> 00:03:04,610
give you a chance to come here.

38
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:05,610
Take a seat!

39
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:07,610
Take a seat!

40
00:03:28,289 --> 00:03:31,120
I can't wait to see you.

41
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,120
I can't wait to see you.
