1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:05,459
So, your father ran Black's law firm.

2
00:00:05,459 --> 00:00:07,459
You're a Yale law school grad,

3
00:00:07,459 --> 00:00:10,009
and now you're applying for an assistant role?

4
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:11,009
It doesn't add up.

5
00:00:11,009 --> 00:00:13,009
You don't need to understand.

6
00:00:13,009 --> 00:00:15,009
Just see that I'm qualified.

7
00:00:15,009 --> 00:00:19,410
Your father's firm tanked.

8
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:23,410
You think just because you're some fancy Yale school grad

9
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:25,410
that you get a free pass?

10
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,410
Assistant or not? You're not special.

11
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:32,259
What the hell is going on here?

12
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:35,030
Look, I am so sorry.

13
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:37,030
Okay, this should not happen.

14
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:39,759
You okay?

15
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:45,950
Is this how you treat applicants?

16
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:48,109
Mr. Winkler, I didn't need-

17
00:00:48,109 --> 00:00:50,109
Go get the medical kit.

18
00:00:50,109 --> 00:00:51,109
Now!

19
00:00:51,109 --> 00:00:55,380
So that's what's the plan?

20
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:58,380
Whole Harrison Strings? Play the victim?

21
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,380
Sebastian New heat fall for it?

22
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:01,380
Clever.
