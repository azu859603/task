00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.380
So why is a

2
00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.380
one successful lawyer

3
00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.380
applying for an assistant job?

4
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.380
Well, if you saw the news

5
00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.429
the recent murder case

6
00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:24.379
is victims of my family.

7
00:00:24.379 --> 00:00:25.379
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:25.379 --> 00:00:26.379
Yeah.

9
00:00:26.379 --> 00:00:29.379
My father's firm's license got suspended, so

10
00:00:29.379 --> 00:00:32.049
no firm will touch me now.

11
00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:34.049
But I need this job

12
00:00:34.049 --> 00:00:35.049
for my sister.

13
00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:37.049
She's the only survivor.

14
00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:39.049
Can I ask why

15
00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:41.369
the license was suspended?

16
00:00:41.369 --> 00:00:45.100
Oh, my father, he...

17
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.340
he pushed you hard.

18
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.460
Crossed lines.

19
00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.460
But I wasn't involved.

20
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.460
Please, Mr. Winkler, I won't be dismissed

21
00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.460
for my father's mistakes, will I?

22
00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.439
Well, I heard you have a meeting in 10 minutes,

23
00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:04.439
so I'll let you get to it.

24
00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.750
Hey, hey.

25
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.519
You'll make a great assistant.

26
00:01:09.519 --> 00:01:12.319
Okay, welcome aboard.

27
00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:14.319
Thank you, Mr. Winkler.

28
00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:15.319
Harrison.

29
00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:18.469
You can call me Harrison.
