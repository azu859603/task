1
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,420
Your second mission? Kill Harrison's unborn baby.

2
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:24,750
I'm no saint, but that's evil.

3
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,789
Look, it's not murder. It's barely three months alive.

4
00:00:28,789 --> 00:00:30,550
Legally, that's nothing.

5
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:39,960
If my father finds out about that baby, Harrison gets everything.

6
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:49,100
Do the math. No inheritance. No payment. Still feeling more?

7
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,799
Do I have a choice?

8
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:56,119
You need the money for your sister, don't you?

9
00:00:56,119 --> 00:01:23,739
I'm a black into advanced care. I'll pay for the whole thing.

10
00:01:23,739 --> 00:01:36,239
She's the key to her sister. Money for your sister.
