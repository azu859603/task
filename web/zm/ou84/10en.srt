1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,439
Harrison, it is not what it looks like.

2
00:00:02,439 --> 00:00:04,040
Oh, it's exactly what it looks like.

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,160
She's carrying my baby.

4
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,830
Enough!

5
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:08,429
What are you doing just leave?

6
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:09,869
No, not without my baby.

7
00:00:09,869 --> 00:00:10,750
What are you planning on doing?

8
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:12,310
Marrying him and pretending it's his?

9
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:13,230
That's disgusting.

10
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,070
This is absurd security!

11
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:16,510
Get him out of here.

12
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:17,870
No need for that.

13
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:20,190
I'll leave.

14
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:24,629
Lisa, you'll regret this.

15
00:00:24,629 --> 00:00:27,109
Harrison, this is an embarrassment.

16
00:00:27,109 --> 00:00:29,070
I warned you not just anybody

17
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,789
is fit to be in this family.

18
00:00:31,629 --> 00:00:33,070
We're figuring it out, right?

19
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:33,909
We're laughing.

20
00:00:33,909 --> 00:00:35,270
Figuring it out?

21
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:38,030
A scandal like this as an engagement party?

22
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:40,549
The press is going to tear us apart.

23
00:00:40,549 --> 00:00:42,590
Oh, and you can forget about handing you

24
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:44,310
the Happy Holiday Village Project.

25
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:47,490
There's no way in hell I'm giving it to you now.

26
00:00:47,490 --> 00:01:02,320
My God.

27
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,899
Do you think you've earned it?

28
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:08,590
I got rid of your problem, didn't I?

29
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:09,590
I'm getting cute with me.
