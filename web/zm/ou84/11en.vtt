1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.379
Don't get cute with me.

2
00:00:01.379 --> 00:00:03.819
I don't know what you're talking about, Mr. Winkle.

3
00:00:03.819 --> 00:00:07.759
Bringing Chris into the little family drama, what's the angle?

4
00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:10.480
I think he can blow up the engagement with the cleanest way to do it.

5
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.679
The way the baby doesn't have to disappear, it was best for everybody.

6
00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.879
You're digging us into a hole. This could blow back on all of us.

7
00:00:19.879 --> 00:00:21.719
I did my homework.

8
00:00:21.719 --> 00:00:27.079
The baby's not Harrison's.

9
00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:30.679
Can't even deal with an unborn child.

10
00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:35.479
It's a life, Sebastian. It matters.

11
00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.280
Are you trying to be a good person or something?

12
00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.729
What's next? Donating the charity?

13
00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:47.340
I was never a good person.

14
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.939
I submitted evidence that wasn't clear.

15
00:00:49.939 --> 00:00:56.189
My father used it, and they died.

16
00:00:56.189 --> 00:01:01.270
My mother, my sister.

17
00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:06.010
I'm the one who should have gone.

18
00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:11.400
Well, the takeaway, being a smart ass, makes you dumb.

19
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.540
Thanks for the insight.

20
00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.609
Go. Take care of Harrison.

21
00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:22.829
I'll wire you the money, but you pull a stunt like this again, and it won't end well.

22
00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:44.780
I hear you, Mr. Wigler.

23
00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.280
Please, John.

24
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.459
Why did you leave me? I don't...

25
00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:49.379
How is black?

26
00:01:49.379 --> 00:01:51.060
I don't understand what I did.

27
00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.219
Look what you've done.

28
00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:57.769
Why? What do I do?

29
00:01:57.769 --> 00:02:06.280
I'm sorry.

30
00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:24.120
I didn't... I'm not... I didn't mean to do that.

31
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:30.060
It's okay.

32
00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:44.639
Stay.

33
00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:47.740
Got anything on the guy who was at Black's house that night?

34
00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.360
The day of the gas, one of the buildings, janitors, went missing.

35
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.449
I think he's our guy.

36
00:02:53.449 --> 00:03:04.030
Keep digging. Find him.

37
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.150
Next week, we'll be breaking ground in Happy Holiday Village.

38
00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.629
A guy in the Williams will be in attendance.

39
00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:15.430
Now the Williams' family has pulled out all the strings to make sure we got this land.

40
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.650
Now I think it's time that we return the favor.

41
00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:25.349
Harrison, a year of Diane has quite the soft spot for you.

42
00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:29.120
Aww. Still nursing a broken heart.

43
00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:37.000
Oh, this over a mechanic's daughter?

44
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.539
Now listen up.

45
00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:44.659
Diane's father is ready to offer 10% of his company shares to whichever one of you marry her.

46
00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:46.960
Wait. Seriously? 10%.

47
00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.560
10%?

48
00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.759
Listen, sir. You're not allowed to be here.

49
00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:53.080
Hey, sir. What the hell are you doing here?

50
00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.979
I heard that you're still on up on me.

51
00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:58.310
You deserve better than this. You deserve better than me.

52
00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:00.810
Harrison, you are making a fool out of yourself.

53
00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.210
Getting her out of here now.

54
00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:04.509
No, you don't understand. It's not what it looks like.

55
00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:06.110
It's him.

56
00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:09.409
It's Sebastian, it's all his fault. You made me do all of it.

57
00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:17.009
Sebastian, it's all his fault. You made me do all of it.

58
00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:18.509
So what are you talking about?

59
00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:22.610
Sebastian, I heard somebody push my dad off the scaffolding.

60
00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.209
Rook's leg.

61
00:04:24.209 --> 00:04:29.050
And then he threatened me that if I didn't do exactly what he said,

62
00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.750
my dad wouldn't be so lucky next time.

63
00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.779
Wow. That's quite an accusation.

64
00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:36.500
You have any proof?

65
00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:44.980
You. Sebastian signed it himself.

66
00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:48.879
Richard, Sebastian's signature is on this.

67
00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:53.180
Our company name, Wiggler Inc.

68
00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.259
Why would he give you that kind of money?

69
00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:59.029
Sebastian paid Chris to ruin the engagement party.

70
00:04:59.029 --> 00:05:02.970
That everything fell apart.

71
00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.079
But maybe it's yours.

72
00:05:05.079 --> 00:05:09.370
He's been blackmailing me, trying to get me to get rid of it.

73
00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.970
Sebastian, how could you?

74
00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:13.370
Did Sebastian did that?

75
00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.110
Yes.

76
00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.910
Now that that can't be true, you wouldn't do that.

77
00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:19.209
Huh? Really?

78
00:05:19.209 --> 00:05:28.459
Did you deal with Sebastian directly, or did you work with some kind of middleman on this Lisa?

79
00:05:28.459 --> 00:05:33.980
Lisa, you took my money, and now you're stabbing me in the back, double dipping much?

80
00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:35.480
He's covering for me.

81
00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.480
Why?

82
00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:43.060
You're such an asshole.

83
00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:50.529
I don't have a son like you.

84
00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:53.029
You're disgrace.

85
00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:54.029
Take him!

86
00:05:57.319 --> 00:06:00.319
I should have let you rot in an orphanage.

87
00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:03.899
Sebastian's always been twisted.

88
00:06:03.899 --> 00:06:06.120
He killed Harrison's child.

89
00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.120
You must be punished.

90
00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:12.180
I should have never let your mother bring you into this world.

91
00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.180
You and your mother have been here.

92
00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:26.250
I think I'm on a curse!

93
00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:30.000
Happy Holiday Village Project's yours now.

94
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Thank you, brother.

95
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.500
Keep him here all night.

96
00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:36.500
I want him to think about what he has done.

97
00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:53.529
He's being punished because of me.

98
00:06:53.529 --> 00:06:54.529
Fuck off.

99
00:06:54.529 --> 00:07:00.470
A little angel.

100
00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:04.259
Everyone loves an angel of jazz.

101
00:07:04.259 --> 00:07:05.259
Nobody loves a wolf.

102
00:07:05.259 --> 00:07:08.319
I'll rip the fucking hell off your head.

103
00:07:08.319 --> 00:07:19.250
Your little fraud.

104
00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:22.750
I realized he was treated like this by his own family.

105
00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:37.649
You look terrible.

106
00:07:37.649 --> 00:07:38.649
Your husband.

107
00:07:38.649 --> 00:07:40.149
There's a medical kit.

108
00:07:40.149 --> 00:07:41.149
There.

109
00:07:41.149 --> 00:07:42.149
You need treatment.

110
00:07:42.149 --> 00:07:43.149
I said medical kit.

111
00:07:43.149 --> 00:08:07.189
Now.

112
00:08:07.189 --> 00:08:08.189
Scars.

113
00:08:08.189 --> 00:08:09.189
None of your damn business.

114
00:08:09.189 --> 00:08:10.189
Just do what you're told.

115
00:08:10.189 --> 00:08:11.189
You need painkillers.

116
00:08:11.189 --> 00:08:13.189
I'll go get you some water.

117
00:08:13.189 --> 00:08:17.079
There's something going on.

118
00:08:17.079 --> 00:08:20.110
Something more with Lisa.

119
00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:24.430
Someone faked the signature on that check.

120
00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:26.430
Something else is going on here.

121
00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:27.649
Edward?

122
00:08:27.649 --> 00:08:29.910
Why not Harrison?

123
00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:34.980
He's not like this.

124
00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:41.190
You and I were just like rats in a sewer.

125
00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:42.730
What about him?

126
00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:47.419
Well, I got another job fair.

127
00:08:48.419 --> 00:08:49.419
Ghost of deuce.

128
00:08:49.419 --> 00:08:50.419
That little angel.

129
00:08:50.419 --> 00:08:51.419
You hear me?

130
00:08:51.419 --> 00:08:53.610
What if I say no?

131
00:08:53.610 --> 00:09:01.629
Get to say no.

132
00:09:01.629 --> 00:09:04.629
Tell me you actually caught feelings for him.

133
00:09:04.629 --> 00:09:15.019
I don't care about you enough to be jealous.

134
00:09:15.019 --> 00:09:19.539
What's wrong?

135
00:09:19.539 --> 00:09:21.309
You scared me?

136
00:09:21.309 --> 00:09:35.929
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for coming today.

137
00:09:35.929 --> 00:09:42.929
I am pleased to announce that my youngest brother Edward will be leading the Happy Holiday Village Project.

138
00:09:42.929 --> 00:09:52.279
Diana.

139
00:09:52.279 --> 00:09:55.529
That's so happy you could make it.

140
00:09:55.529 --> 00:09:56.529
Where's Harrison?

141
00:09:56.529 --> 00:09:59.529
He's not here today, but I'd be happy to keep you company.

142
00:09:59.529 --> 00:10:00.529
No.

143
00:10:00.529 --> 00:10:02.529
You're too old for me, Uncle Edward.

144
00:10:02.529 --> 00:10:03.529
We have nothing to discuss.

145
00:10:03.529 --> 00:10:05.529
I'll find Harrison.

146
00:10:05.529 --> 00:10:07.399
Oh, my God.

147
00:10:07.399 --> 00:10:09.399
What the hell is wrong with you?

148
00:10:09.399 --> 00:10:11.429
That's my life.

149
00:10:11.429 --> 00:10:12.429
Are you blind?

150
00:10:12.429 --> 00:10:13.429
Excuse me?

151
00:10:13.429 --> 00:10:17.159
Are you blind?

152
00:10:17.159 --> 00:10:18.159
Excuse me?

153
00:10:18.159 --> 00:10:23.679
You're Sebastian Winkler, right?

154
00:10:23.679 --> 00:10:25.679
I've heard all about you.

155
00:10:25.679 --> 00:10:28.679
You're the family screw up, and now I see why.

156
00:10:28.679 --> 00:10:30.679
It's not supposed to hurt my feelings.

157
00:10:30.679 --> 00:10:31.679
You ruined my dress.

158
00:10:31.679 --> 00:10:32.679
It's just a dress.

159
00:10:32.679 --> 00:10:33.679
Just a dress.

160
00:10:33.679 --> 00:10:37.070
This is a limited edition.

161
00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:39.070
Splend wide so uniquely ugly.

162
00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:41.700
I'll buy you a new one.

163
00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:52.159
That's why you want me to get close to Harrison.

164
00:10:52.159 --> 00:10:55.159
So you can line yourself up with Diana.

165
00:10:55.159 --> 00:11:04.389
Whoa, you good?

166
00:11:04.389 --> 00:11:05.389
What's wrong?

167
00:11:05.389 --> 00:11:08.610
Yeah, I think I twisted my ankle.

168
00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:09.610
Okay.

169
00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:11.610
Let's get you a doctor, okay?

170
00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:17.559
Then go seduce that little angel.

171
00:11:17.559 --> 00:11:33.759
Here is she.

172
00:11:33.759 --> 00:11:35.759
Harrison is an assistant.

173
00:11:35.759 --> 00:11:37.980
Are you jealous?

174
00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:41.429
Please, I couldn't care less about her.

175
00:11:41.429 --> 00:11:45.429
But I did hear her family was wiped out in some tragic fire.

176
00:11:45.429 --> 00:11:47.590
Talk about bad luck.

177
00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:51.769
If someone born into money, you should gossip like a boy to housewife.

178
00:11:51.769 --> 00:11:52.769
How dare you?

179
00:11:52.769 --> 00:11:56.720
The hell are you doing now?

180
00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:57.720
Give them back later.

181
00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:10.600
Thank you, Mr. Winkler.

182
00:12:11.799 --> 00:12:13.799
It's Harry, okay?

183
00:12:13.799 --> 00:12:19.279
Look, Doc said to get some rest, so just take it easy.

184
00:12:19.279 --> 00:12:20.279
Thanks, Harry.

185
00:12:20.279 --> 00:12:23.879
You don't have to be so polite, all right?

186
00:12:23.879 --> 00:12:29.960
You should get some rest, okay?

187
00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:31.960
You have lipstick on your face.

188
00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.179
Lipstick?

189
00:12:33.179 --> 00:12:34.179
Yeah, yeah, let me get it.

190
00:12:34.179 --> 00:12:35.179
Okay.

191
00:12:35.179 --> 00:13:04.509
Um, can you go grab that one?

192
00:13:04.509 --> 00:13:05.509
Thanks, Alice.

193
00:13:05.509 --> 00:13:07.080
Good night.

194
00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:11.919
Good night, Harry.

195
00:13:11.919 --> 00:13:21.659
You're quite the actress.

196
00:13:21.659 --> 00:13:23.820
I'm just doing what you told me to.

197
00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:31.470
Didn't know Miss Black had such the talent for seduction.

198
00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:32.690
We're in your house.

199
00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:34.690
Are you not afraid of getting caught?

200
00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:36.690
I like the rescue, don't you?

201
00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:39.750
You're a monster.

202
00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:42.129
I've been called worse.

203
00:13:42.129 --> 00:13:45.129
Shouldn't it should be more focused on Diana?

204
00:13:45.129 --> 00:13:47.129
Your father seems pretty set with her and Harris.

205
00:13:47.129 --> 00:13:48.129
They don't fit together.

206
00:13:48.129 --> 00:13:50.129
She's just a bond.

207
00:13:50.129 --> 00:13:54.620
You made it.

208
00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:56.129
You like this game.

209
00:13:56.129 --> 00:13:59.220
I don't really care.

210
00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:16.539
The house.

211
00:14:16.539 --> 00:14:20.070
Harrison, I'm awake.

212
00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:21.070
Do you need something?

213
00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:24.100
I just wanted to check in on you.

214
00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:26.230
Um, can I come in?

215
00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:33.480
If you don't mind, I'll come in now.

216
00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:35.309
No, no.

217
00:14:35.309 --> 00:14:36.529
Um, I'm sorry.

218
00:14:36.529 --> 00:14:38.529
Actually, I have to change.

219
00:14:38.529 --> 00:14:41.529
Um, but I'm feeling a lot better.

220
00:14:41.529 --> 00:14:43.629
So, yeah.

221
00:14:43.629 --> 00:14:44.759
Okay.

222
00:14:44.759 --> 00:14:47.909
Alright, I'll see you later then.

223
00:14:47.909 --> 00:14:54.600
Yeah, see ya.

224
00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:55.600
What the hell is wrong with you?

225
00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:56.600
This isn't some game.

226
00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:09.120
A gift.

227
00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:15.190
Harrison cares about you now.

228
00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:17.190
You played your part well.

229
00:15:17.190 --> 00:15:22.039
Consider it a reward.

230
00:15:22.039 --> 00:15:23.039
You should go.

231
00:15:23.039 --> 00:15:25.039
Someone will notice you're not in your room.

232
00:15:25.039 --> 00:15:38.210
Edward named his new hotel after Diana.

233
00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:40.210
Your rich guys are really good at chasing women.

234
00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:46.539
Yeah, he's gonna propose tonight.

235
00:15:46.539 --> 00:15:48.539
I didn't know Sebastian would show up though.

236
00:15:48.539 --> 00:16:00.049
Looks like there will be drama today.

237
00:16:00.049 --> 00:16:02.049
I don't recall inviting you here.

238
00:16:02.049 --> 00:16:05.049
Well, it's your big moment, uncle.

239
00:16:05.049 --> 00:16:07.120
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

240
00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:08.120
It doesn't matter.

241
00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:11.309
Diane's gonna be my fiance by the end of the night.

242
00:16:11.309 --> 00:16:12.309
Mmm.

243
00:16:12.309 --> 00:16:13.470
Confident.

244
00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:32.039
You actually think she would go for a bastard like you.

245
00:16:32.039 --> 00:16:35.029
Diana, happy birthday.

246
00:16:35.029 --> 00:16:37.190
How thoughtful.

247
00:16:37.190 --> 00:16:40.250
I have a bigger surprise for you.

248
00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:41.250
What's this about?

249
00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:44.250
Well, Diana, today's your birthday.

250
00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:50.070
And I want to ask you a special thing on your special day.

251
00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:51.070
Will you marry me?

252
00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:52.230
Edward.

253
00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:54.230
This is all so sudden.

254
00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:56.230
It's a one of a kind.

255
00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:59.230
I bought it from Africa and crafted by the best jeweler.

256
00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:02.610
If you wanted the stars, Diana, I'd get them for you.

257
00:17:02.610 --> 00:17:09.880
Uncle, does dad know you're using money from the company to fund this little fantasy?

258
00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:14.200
I mean, you renamed this place just to impress her.

259
00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:17.200
The foreign investors are expecting our family name on this hotel.

260
00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:18.200
What?

261
00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:20.200
Diana, don't listen to him.

262
00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:22.200
I have a stake in the family business, all right?

263
00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:23.200
It's not like I'm stealing.

264
00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:24.200
You're just a little brother.

265
00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:25.200
You're not in error.

266
00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:27.200
It's me and Harrison.

267
00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:29.200
You are nowhere in the line of succession.

268
00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:31.200
You don't count Sebastian, you pedestrian.

269
00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:34.200
So tell me, how much did you embezzle to buy that ring?

270
00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:41.319
Shut up.

271
00:17:41.319 --> 00:17:45.829
Diana, if I were you, I wouldn't say yes to her.

272
00:17:45.829 --> 00:17:47.829
His debts are a little heavy.

273
00:17:47.829 --> 00:17:50.180
I wasn't planning on her.

274
00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:52.980
Don't trust him, Diana.

275
00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:55.200
He's only using you.

276
00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:57.200
For once, you're not wrong, uncle.

277
00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:04.230
Diana, our dad told us whoever marries you has access to the best resources in our family.

278
00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:07.230
So, that leaves us with three options.

279
00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:09.740
Which one will it be?

280
00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:11.799
Do you admit you're using me?

281
00:18:11.799 --> 00:18:12.799
But I appreciate your calendar.

282
00:18:12.799 --> 00:18:17.839
I'm a lot of things, but I've never been dishonest about my intentions.

283
00:18:17.839 --> 00:18:19.839
Self-aware, I'll give you that much.

284
00:18:19.839 --> 00:18:22.839
But it's going to take much more than that to make me choose you.

285
00:18:22.839 --> 00:18:38.819
Diana, Diana, marry me, so I can have what I'm meant to take.

286
00:18:38.819 --> 00:18:40.819
And what's in it for me?

287
00:18:40.819 --> 00:18:41.819
Think of it like this.

288
00:18:41.819 --> 00:18:53.170
It's much more exciting to shape your husband, rather than marry a man who already thinks he's perfect.

289
00:18:53.170 --> 00:18:56.160
Take that as he asks.

290
00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:57.160
Don't disappoint me.

291
00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:58.359
Never.

292
00:18:58.359 --> 00:18:59.359
Bye, lady.

293
00:18:59.359 --> 00:19:02.250
You see that, uncle?

294
00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:03.250
That's how you win.

295
00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:05.920
You're just too old-fashioned.

296
00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:06.920
Asshole.

297
00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:08.920
I'm going to make you regret this.

298
00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:12.019
Her Diana's been interested in you for quite a long time.

299
00:19:12.019 --> 00:19:14.299
Yeah.

300
00:19:14.299 --> 00:19:15.750
Yeah, maybe.

301
00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:21.079
I'm not about to use marriage as a tool.

302
00:19:21.079 --> 00:19:24.910
All right, I'll marry somebody I love.

303
00:19:24.910 --> 00:19:31.140
I'm not about to use marriage as a tool.

304
00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:43.759
All right, I'll marry somebody I love.

305
00:19:43.759 --> 00:19:44.759
True gentleman.

306
00:19:44.759 --> 00:19:56.650
Wait a minute.

307
00:19:56.650 --> 00:19:58.650
Does she live here too?

308
00:19:58.650 --> 00:20:00.650
She's just my younger brother's assistant.

309
00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:04.099
A pretty face from a poor family.

310
00:20:04.099 --> 00:20:07.099
Your brother has, uh, interesting taste.

311
00:20:07.099 --> 00:20:10.509
Oh, wait.

312
00:20:10.509 --> 00:20:14.759
How come your earrings look exactly like mine?

313
00:20:14.759 --> 00:20:20.700
How come your earrings look exactly like mine?

314
00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:24.170
They are mine!

315
00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:26.650
What the fuck are you doing?

316
00:20:26.650 --> 00:20:27.650
I remember you took my earrings.

317
00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:28.650
Why does she have them?

318
00:20:28.650 --> 00:20:30.650
How do you explain that?

319
00:20:32.289 --> 00:20:34.289
Are your earrings one of a kind?

320
00:20:34.289 --> 00:20:37.289
You're telling me that she has a pair identical to mine.

321
00:20:37.289 --> 00:20:38.289
That's ridiculous!

322
00:20:38.289 --> 00:20:40.289
What if it is a coincidence?

323
00:20:40.289 --> 00:20:42.869
Give me my earrings now.

324
00:20:42.869 --> 00:20:44.869
Would you apologize if you're wrong?

325
00:20:44.869 --> 00:20:48.150
Give me my earrings first.

326
00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:49.150
You should apologize.

327
00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:54.089
What the hell is this?

328
00:20:54.089 --> 00:20:56.089
Diana, you're being crazy.

329
00:20:56.089 --> 00:20:57.089
Like, what are you doing?

330
00:20:57.089 --> 00:20:58.089
Apologize to Alice now.

331
00:20:58.089 --> 00:21:00.089
Apologize to her.

332
00:21:00.089 --> 00:21:01.089
Yeah.

333
00:21:01.089 --> 00:21:03.089
She doesn't deserve the things I wear.

334
00:21:03.089 --> 00:21:05.089
Look, just because you can afford to have it,

335
00:21:05.089 --> 00:21:07.089
doesn't mean you deserve to burn it.

336
00:21:07.089 --> 00:21:20.519
I will apologize for my fiance.

337
00:21:20.519 --> 00:21:24.099
But you shouldn't be so worried about an assistant.

338
00:21:24.099 --> 00:21:31.440
Are you okay?

339
00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:44.059
Coming to my room in the middle of the night.
