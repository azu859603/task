00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I'm coming to my room in the middle of the night.

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Aren't you afraid you're gonna get caught?

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.349
Harrison cares about you now.

4
00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:08.929
That's good.

5
00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:11.150
Why are you doing this?

6
00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.660
I'm already pushing it and now you make my Diana hate me.

7
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.660
Jealousy fuels competition.

8
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.660
Diana is too used to having what she wants handed to her.

9
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.660
I need her to feel.

10
00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.199
So I'm just your pawn.

11
00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:32.869
Just a dog that you let out to bite whenever you want.

12
00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:39.780
No, you're not a dog.

13
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:40.780
You're a fox.

14
00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.100
Clever.

15
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.380
And jealous.

16
00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.789
How much do I get paid to play the jealous fox?

17
00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:52.100
Depends on how convincing you are.

18
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.409
If you keep paying me, any type of jealousy you want.

19
00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:00.780
I think you're in control here.

20
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.939
Just do as I say.

21
00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:05.939
And don't even think about running away.

22
00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.180
I'll go to Harrison.
