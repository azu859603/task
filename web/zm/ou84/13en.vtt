00:00:05.389 --> 00:00:15.390
Hello.

2
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:19.390
Miss Black, we're transferring your sister from the special room to the regular room.

3
00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.379
What? Why?

4
00:00:22.379 --> 00:00:27.879
Dr. Fang, are you transferring my sister?

5
00:00:27.879 --> 00:00:31.879
She's not getting any better and I already paid for the special room.

6
00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:34.880
We don't know when she'll wake up, Miss Black.

7
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.880
Keeping her in the special room definitely is a waste of resources.

8
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.880
You can't make her medical decisions without my permission.

9
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.329
You know, I'm going to report you.

10
00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.329
What is all of this noise?

11
00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:48.329
Is there a problem?

12
00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.359
Miss Williams, what are you doing here?

13
00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:55.939
Oh, it's Harrison's little assistant.

14
00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:56.939
Where are you here?

15
00:00:56.939 --> 00:00:59.939
I'm visiting my sister. I didn't expect to see you here.

16
00:00:59.939 --> 00:01:05.579
Wait, your family member is in the special ward, isn't she?

17
00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:07.579
That isn't none of your concern.

18
00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:10.579
You can't move my sister for your convenience.

19
00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:13.579
Dr. Fang, I thought this hospital had standards.

20
00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:19.579
If you're letting just anyone occupy these special rooms, I'll have to reconsider my investment next quarter.

21
00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:22.579
We'll rectify the situation immediately, Miss Williams.

22
00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:31.629
Miss Black, we'll refund the remaining medical bills.

23
00:01:31.629 --> 00:01:34.629
Please transfer your sister to another hospital as soon as possible.
