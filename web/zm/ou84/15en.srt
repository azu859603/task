1
00:00:04,429 --> 00:00:20,769
How's your day father?

2
00:00:20,769 --> 00:00:22,989
Couldn't do better.

3
00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:25,989
Your engagement to Diana is a big win pass.

4
00:00:25,989 --> 00:00:28,250
Really pulled through.

5
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:29,250
Thank you, Father.

6
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,250
I'll be sure to take care of her.

7
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:32,250
That's good to hear.

8
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:36,250
And I decided to make you create a director of the Happy Holiday Village Project.

9
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:40,250
Edward's really not the artistic type and I need you to steer things.

10
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,469
I'd be honored.

11
00:00:42,469 --> 00:00:43,469
Good.

12
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:46,469
And once you marry Diana, you'll get 10% of the company shares.

13
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:48,759
I won't let you down.

14
00:00:51,299 --> 00:00:52,299
Okay.

15
00:00:52,299 --> 00:00:53,299
Sebastian.

16
00:00:53,299 --> 00:00:55,520
I won't let you win.
