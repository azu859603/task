1
00:00:07,339 --> 00:00:09,640
I'm sure he's just a few minutes away.

2
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,640
It's one second.

3
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:19,469
What is going on with him?

4
00:00:19,469 --> 00:00:21,469
Why isn't he answering?

5
00:00:21,469 --> 00:00:23,760
It's late to his own engagement.

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,260
This is how the Winthler family treats us with disrespect.

7
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,260
I deeply apologize.

8
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,760
This is not like him.

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,259
Dad, I'm sure something must have happened.

10
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:36,039
He wouldn't do this on purpose, right?

11
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:37,560
Right.

12
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:47,200
Sorry I'm late, everyone.

13
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,700
Badge, what the hell happened?

14
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,310
Car accident.

15
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:51,310
Oh, my God.

16
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:52,310
Are you okay?

17
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:53,810
Do you have to go to the hospital?

18
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:55,810
Come on, he's fine.

19
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:57,810
Probably some brake failure or something.

20
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:00,229
Total accident.

21
00:01:00,229 --> 00:01:02,229
I never mentioned brake failure.

22
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:03,229
How did you know?

23
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:08,079
Just a lucky guess.

24
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:09,079
Well, I didn't do it.

25
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:11,790
What the hell?

26
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:14,290
He's nothing but a bastard like a dog.

27
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:15,290
Why do you keep protecting him?

28
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:19,290
Well, even if he is a dog, he's my dog.

29
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:20,290
And you don't get to insult him.

30
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:21,290
You heard that?

31
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:23,290
You're nothing but a fucking dog.

32
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:24,290
You're a little pet.
