00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
Not your man, Diana.

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:02.940
Remember?

3
00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:03.839
I'm your dog.

4
00:00:03.839 --> 00:00:05.679
Hey, hey, Alex, you okay?

5
00:00:05.679 --> 00:00:07.830
Good?

6
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:08.830
Diana, what are you doing?

7
00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:09.669
Why'd you do that?

8
00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:14.980
Because she is constantly trying to seduce my fiance.

9
00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.010
Well, it's clear who the real couple here is.

10
00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:31.489
Let's go, Diana.

11
00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:32.850
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

12
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.250
Okay, I...

13
00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:35.530
They're only doing that because of me.

14
00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.320
I promise it's...

15
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.479
Sebastian hates me.

16
00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:42.399
Okay, he's hated me since we were kids.

17
00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:45.659
Why does he hate you so much?

18
00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:48.820
My father left his mother for mine.

19
00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.700
So, I guess he's just built up that resentment, that anger,

20
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.020
carried it with him, I don't know.

21
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.060
But I seriously believe that if he had the chance,

22
00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.299
he'd kill me.

23
00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:02.270
Kill you.

24
00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:03.670
He's your brother.

25
00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.579
No, no, he's capable of cruelty.

26
00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:08.819
Okay, just like his mother.
