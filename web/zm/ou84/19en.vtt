00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.059
So I think it's a beautiful gown.

2
00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:05.459
It's a beautiful gown.

3
00:00:05.459 --> 00:00:07.629
I think it's a beautiful gown.

4
00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:14.730
I think it's a beautiful gown.

5
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:15.730
It's beautiful.

6
00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:16.570
I'm terrible.

7
00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:17.570
I'm terrible.

8
00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.690
I just like to say it's like she was still in her room.

9
00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:21.289
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:21.969
I can't stress this.

11
00:00:21.969 --> 00:00:23.230
That's not my fault.

12
00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.230
Oh.

13
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.109
Oh.

14
00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:35.409
What is wrong with you?

15
00:00:35.409 --> 00:00:37.640
Do you really hate me that much?

16
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.810
I'm just on in your game, Mr. Reinclaire.

17
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.719
Shouldn't you be back at your engagement party?

18
00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:50.770
Your sister's surgery is scheduled for Monday.

19
00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.329
Dr. Johnson is handling it.

20
00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:53.560
He's the best.

21
00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.990
That's soon?

22
00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.189
Don't you want me to finish my mission first?

23
00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:59.310
I could push it back.

24
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:00.109
That's what you want.

25
00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:00.950
No.

26
00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:02.310
Thank you.

27
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:04.260
Thank you, Mr. Reinclaire.

28
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.459
Call me by my name.

29
00:01:06.459 --> 00:01:08.319
Like you do with Harrison.

30
00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:18.519
Sebastian.

31
00:01:18.519 --> 00:01:21.329
Come back to my forces in Sweden.

32
00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:22.329
Now.
