1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,080
Ms. Black, you're seven weeks pregnant.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:09,720
Are you sure you want to terminate this pregnancy?

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,730
Positive.

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,230
Well, we can schedule a procedure for next week.

5
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:18,870
Does a father know?

6
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:19,870
He doesn't need to.

7
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:38,289
Is he the machine?

8
00:00:38,289 --> 00:00:40,799
A father who can't be loved.

9
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:43,659
A child who isn't wanted.

10
00:00:43,659 --> 00:00:47,340
Alice, Alice, I think I should be okay.

11
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,340
Harrison, what are you doing here?

12
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,340
Well, you disappeared without a word.

13
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,340
Again.

14
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,340
If I found your phone in the woods last night.

15
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,460
Yeah.

16
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,460
I didn't feel well, so I left early.

17
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,460
I'm sorry, I should have told you.

18
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:02,460
Yeah, I was worried.

19
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,459
I mean, I checked every hospital in LA before I found you here.

20
00:01:06,459 --> 00:01:08,750
You didn't have to do that, Harrison.

21
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:09,750
Yeah, I know.

22
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:17,870
Obviously I didn't have to do that, but I care about you.

23
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:32,159
Alice, are you pregnant?
