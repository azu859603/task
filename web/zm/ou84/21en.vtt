00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520
Ellis, are you pregnant?

2
00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.219
I'm sorry. I'll resign immediately.

3
00:00:05.219 --> 00:00:11.640
I didn't know you had a partner.

4
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.929
I don't. It was a mistake.

5
00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:17.929
But I already decided to terminate the pregnancy, so...

6
00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:19.429
What? No, no. You can't do that.

7
00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:21.929
Don't ask me about this.

8
00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:23.929
It's my own personal matter.

9
00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:28.660
Look, just... keep the baby.

10
00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.920
I'll take care of it.

11
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.090
I know that sounds ridiculous, okay?

12
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.590
But I'm not just gonna...

13
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.590
Stand by and let you go through this alone.

14
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:41.590
I know it's not mine.

15
00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:43.590
Okay, I get it. I understand, Ellis.

16
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.590
But that doesn't matter.

17
00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:46.590
I care about you.

18
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:55.439
I wanna marry you.

19
00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:58.530
I wanna take care of this child together.

20
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.530
Your father would never approve his son.

21
00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.530
Oh, don't worry about him.

22
00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.530
Okay, I'll convince my father.

23
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.530
He'll be happy to have a firstborn grandson.

24
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:07.530
It's not even your kid.

25
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.530
No, I get it's not.

26
00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:15.650
But, you know, you asked me if you had a place in my family.

27
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.060
Here it is. Let me take care of you both.

28
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.420
I'll approve it to you.
