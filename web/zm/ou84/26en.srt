1
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:07,919
Well, marrying in with the Winkler family, are we?

2
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:09,919
You've got moves. I'll give you that.

3
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:12,919
Excuse me, Miss Williams. Harry's looking for me.

4
00:00:12,919 --> 00:00:16,920
Harry, is that what you call him in the bedroom?

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,920
I didn't know you had any interest in other people's bedroom habits. Diana.

6
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:29,530
I can't talk to my future family.

7
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,530
She's not family. The wedding hasn't happened.

8
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:34,530
Don't get ahead of yourself.

9
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,530
Why do you always defend her? What do you like her to?

10
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:39,530
So that's what this is, huh?

11
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:42,530
Women just see everyone else as a rival?

12
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:45,530
Even you. It's all your money.

13
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:59,780
Born.

14
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:03,130
Yes? I must wake.
