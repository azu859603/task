00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.379
Oh my God.

2
00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:04.580
Now you're awake.

3
00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:06.580
How do you feel?

4
00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.500
Had a bad dream.

5
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:10.500
Alice.

6
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.570
Her mom and dad.

7
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:19.899
You've been in a coma for a few months.

8
00:00:19.899 --> 00:00:20.899
But it's okay.

9
00:00:20.899 --> 00:00:21.899
You just need to rest now.

10
00:00:21.899 --> 00:00:24.899
We'll talk about everything later.

11
00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:27.120
Get them over them with two beds.

12
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.629
They'll need to talk.

13
00:00:29.629 --> 00:00:30.629
My expense.

14
00:00:30.629 --> 00:00:32.789
Right away, Mr. Winkler.

15
00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:40.100
Thank you for your generosity, Mr. Winkler.

16
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.520
Mr. Winkler.

17
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.520
You should go.

18
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.030
I'll ask you again.

19
00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.030
The baby.

20
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.030
No matter how many times you ask,

21
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.159
the answer's still the same.

22
00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:51.159
It's Harrison's.

23
00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:52.350
All right.

24
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.829
Then I have another job for you.

25
00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:56.179
Done.

26
00:00:56.179 --> 00:00:59.109
Emma's awake.

27
00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:02.329
I'm not doing this anymore.

28
00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:03.329
Are you sure?

29
00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.329
You really think Harrison's going to take care of you your entire life?

30
00:01:06.329 --> 00:01:10.280
He's an angel.

31
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.280
I trust him.

32
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:19.420
And what if you're wrong about that?

33
00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:20.420
Bye.

34
00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:21.420
Mr. Winkler.
