1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:05,269
Yeah, for a drink?

2
00:00:05,269 --> 00:00:09,990
You're marrying Diana, soon to be CEO, the world's at your feet.

3
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:17,980
I'm marrying Harrison, so let's just end whatever this twisted little thing is.

4
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:18,980
What about your sister?

5
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:23,370
If you touch her again, I'll end you myself.

6
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:25,820
I have nothing to lose.

7
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:27,460
When did I touch your sister?

8
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,620
You're a liar.

9
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:30,620
Do you really hate me?

10
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:32,979
From now on, I'm Harrison's wife.

11
00:00:32,979 --> 00:00:37,000
You're nothing more than my husband's brother.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,020
That's it.

13
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:55,619
Get out of here.

14
00:00:55,619 --> 00:00:59,450
Ethan, I want you to look into what happened to Emma.

15
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:00,210
Alice's sister.
