1
00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.919
Do you find out something about my parents?

2
00:00:05.919 --> 00:00:14.130
What do you know?

3
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.850
Harrison's the same, isn't he?

4
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.250
Raising another man's child?

5
00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:20.250
But me?

6
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.250
I'm not that generous.

7
00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.620
This is private.

8
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:30.760
They can cross the lines faster.

9
00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.280
He's been getting treatment for months.

10
00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.679
The child isn't his.

11
00:00:34.679 --> 00:00:35.679
It's not yours.

12
00:00:35.679 --> 00:00:36.679
It's not Lisa.

13
00:00:36.679 --> 00:00:37.780
So?

14
00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.579
Harrison is willing to be a good father.

15
00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:42.609
You don't think I would?

16
00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:43.609
How could you?

17
00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:51.130
How could you ever know how to love somebody no one's ever loved you?

18
00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:56.890
Ever know how to love somebody no one's ever loved you?

19
00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.689
I knew it.

20
00:00:58.689 --> 00:01:00.729
What's going on with Alice Black?

21
00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:02.520
Tell me the truth.

22
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.090
Just like she said, she's my brother's fiance.

23
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.340
Don't lie to me.

24
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.859
If you do not want this marriage Sebastian, just tell me.

25
00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:17.180
Just remember, if I don't marry you, you can't be CEO of the Winkler Group.

26
00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.579
Threateningly, go ahead.

27
00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:22.739
Cancel the wedding.

28
00:01:22.739 --> 00:01:25.780
You should know that I don't like being backed into a corner.

29
00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:26.780
Alright then.

30
00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.980
I'll have my father called everything up.

31
00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:30.980
You're squealing.

32
00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:49.140
Alice is everything alright?

33
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.200
You don't look great.

34
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.200
Yeah, fine.

35
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.200
Just probably just tired.

36
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.189
How are you doing?

37
00:01:57.189 --> 00:01:58.799
Better.

38
00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.640
You need to take care of yourself.

39
00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:06.359
I'm so excited to be in here.

40
00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:08.990
So weird.

41
00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.550
No messages, no notifications, but my phone just keeps lighting up.

42
00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:13.550
I don't know.

43
00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:14.969
Let me see.

44
00:02:14.969 --> 00:03:05.830
I made up my mind.

45
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:06.830
The baby isn't Harrison's.

46
00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.430
I'm going to get rid of it.

47
00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:11.870
It wouldn't be fair to him.

48
00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:25.939
It says I support you no matter what you decide.

49
00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:27.939
Congratulations Alice.

50
00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:29.340
My wedding was Sebastian's off.

51
00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:30.340
I'm sure you're thrilled.

52
00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.439
I didn't want that.

53
00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:33.439
I never seduced Sebastian.

54
00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:40.599
I had nothing to do with whatever this rich people circus is.

55
00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:43.020
Bitch, you'll regret this.

56
00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:44.379
One day you'll pay for it.

57
00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:50.500
I didn't even touch you.

58
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:51.860
I see how it is.

59
00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.180
You've liked her all along.

60
00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.419
Perfect Sebastian.

61
00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:57.740
A bastard like you deserves a bitch like her.

62
00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.569
Don't you ever call her that again?

63
00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:09.879
How dare you?

64
00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:14.360
The doctor said they finished all your tests, but they want to keep you here for observation.

65
00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.230
So I'll stay here and watch you.

66
00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:18.430
Why are you always around?

67
00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.959
It feels like anytime I turn a corner, you're just there.

68
00:04:23.959 --> 00:04:25.120
What's that supposed to mean?

69
00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.680
Are you stalking me?

70
00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.199
I drove you to the hospital and I can't even get a thank you.

71
00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:34.319
Once I get rid of this baby, there's nothing left between us.

72
00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:39.579
It's my body.

73
00:04:39.579 --> 00:04:40.579
It's my decision.

74
00:04:40.579 --> 00:04:41.579
Hey, Alice.

75
00:04:41.579 --> 00:04:46.029
What's going on?

76
00:04:46.029 --> 00:04:47.029
Are you okay?

77
00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:49.269
Sebastian, let me make this crystal clear.

78
00:04:49.269 --> 00:04:50.269
All right.

79
00:04:50.269 --> 00:04:51.949
Alice is marrying me.

80
00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:57.060
If you touch her again, I swear to God I'll kill you.

81
00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.699
It just as twisted as your mother.

82
00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:05.329
Don't you dare mention my mother.

83
00:05:05.329 --> 00:05:07.610
Don't you dare mention my mother.

84
00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.230
Harry, let's talk.

85
00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:16.329
Just us.

86
00:05:16.329 --> 00:05:17.329
What is it?

87
00:05:17.329 --> 00:05:19.129
What do you need to tell me?

88
00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:20.129
The baby.

89
00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:38.769
It's Sebastian's.

90
00:05:38.769 --> 00:05:56.860
Before he sent me to be your assistant and Lisa's engagement, I sent Chris to ruin it.

91
00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:03.540
My father wanted you to be with Diana, so Sebastian asked me to seduce you so that

92
00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:06.899
he could be with her.

93
00:06:06.899 --> 00:06:07.899
Terrible things.

94
00:06:07.899 --> 00:06:09.160
Sorry, I...

95
00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.160
I'm not who I think I am.

96
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.160
I'm sorry.

97
00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.160
I'm sorry.

98
00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.959
I'm sorry.

99
00:06:13.959 --> 00:06:14.959
Please call off the wedding.

100
00:06:14.959 --> 00:06:15.959
You deserve someone better.

101
00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:17.990
It's okay, all right.

102
00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:23.079
It doesn't matter why you came into my life, okay?

103
00:06:23.079 --> 00:06:24.600
I fall in love with you.

104
00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:28.980
I fall in love with you, all right?

105
00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:30.980
You told me the truth, okay?

106
00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:31.980
So no more secrets.

107
00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:35.899
I'll raise this child like my own.

108
00:06:35.899 --> 00:06:39.740
How could you love someone who hurt you?

109
00:06:39.740 --> 00:07:02.360
Because I know who you really are, Alice.

110
00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:07.509
I found out that Alice hired a private detective to investigate her parents' case.

111
00:07:07.509 --> 00:07:09.439
How far along is she?

112
00:07:09.439 --> 00:07:14.120
She's close to finding out if it's connected to us, but she doesn't have everything.

113
00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.339
All right, you plan on to explain yourself to her?

114
00:07:16.339 --> 00:07:24.990
Send you a photo.

115
00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:35.829
Her and the picture was parked near her parents' house at the night of the accident.

116
00:07:35.829 --> 00:07:43.180
This is Sebastian's car.

117
00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:44.180
What brings you here, Alice?

118
00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:46.779
I'm here to find evidence of your crimes.

119
00:07:46.779 --> 00:07:51.420
Well, points for honesty, but you won't find anything.

120
00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:56.899
Sebastian, if you were involved in my parents' death, I swear I'll make you pay.

121
00:07:56.899 --> 00:08:00.079
Even a suspect gets to defend himself, doesn't he?

122
00:08:00.079 --> 00:08:01.370
Fine.

123
00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:02.370
Let's start with an easy one.

124
00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:04.139
Did you bug my phone?

125
00:08:04.139 --> 00:08:08.949
Did you bug my phone?

126
00:08:08.949 --> 00:08:09.949
Where's your phone?

127
00:08:09.949 --> 00:08:12.310
I left it in my room.

128
00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:17.480
You coming directly to me tells me I'm not the only one you don't trust.

129
00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:21.060
You must have other suspicions.

130
00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:24.420
Did you know who I was when you sent me to spy on your brother?

131
00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:25.420
Yes.

132
00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:27.500
So you set me up.

133
00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:29.259
You paid me well to do it.

134
00:08:29.259 --> 00:08:30.259
Yes.

135
00:08:30.259 --> 00:08:35.340
Did you count my parents?

136
00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:38.240
I was involved.

137
00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:53.779
Parrison, what are you doing here?

138
00:08:53.779 --> 00:08:55.779
Oh, Emma told me you were here.

139
00:08:55.779 --> 00:08:58.379
I never told Emma where I was going.

140
00:08:58.379 --> 00:08:59.879
Look, yeah.

141
00:08:59.879 --> 00:09:01.379
You forgot your phone again.

142
00:09:01.379 --> 00:09:08.879
Let's try not to forget that next time.

143
00:09:08.879 --> 00:09:09.879
Come on.

144
00:09:09.879 --> 00:09:20.350
Let's go.

145
00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:24.639
So what would you prefer that I do when I was a son?

146
00:09:24.639 --> 00:09:32.000
I located the car.

147
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.120
How does Harrison know, David?

148
00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:39.379
Good thing I came prepared.

149
00:09:39.379 --> 00:09:41.179
I'll try to get some information.

150
00:09:41.179 --> 00:09:43.220
Brando would like not.

151
00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:44.950
Yeah.

152
00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:46.870
David, I've been trying to reach you.

153
00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:49.129
Well, I've been out of town.

154
00:09:49.129 --> 00:09:55.419
But listen, regarding your parents' case, it's too risky to pursue.

155
00:09:55.419 --> 00:09:57.419
There's just too many players involved.

156
00:09:57.419 --> 00:09:58.419
It's not worth it.

157
00:09:58.419 --> 00:09:59.419
What?

158
00:10:00.419 --> 00:10:01.419
No, no.

159
00:10:01.419 --> 00:10:02.419
I found a lead.

160
00:10:02.419 --> 00:10:04.220
I'm ready to go to the police.

161
00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:05.220
What?

162
00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:06.220
No, no, no.

163
00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:07.220
Don't do that.

164
00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:08.220
Let me handle it.

165
00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:11.340
Okay.

166
00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:12.340
I will take care of everything here.

167
00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:13.340
What are you hiding, Harrison?

168
00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:23.690
It's Marl's the big day.

169
00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:27.340
You ready?

170
00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:28.340
You should get some rest.

171
00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:32.610
Okay.

172
00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:54.470
So beautiful.

173
00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:56.740
It's been playing everyone for years.

174
00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:57.940
He's using you.

175
00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:01.750
I'll be back from San Francisco tomorrow.

176
00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:03.899
I know everything.

177
00:11:03.899 --> 00:11:10.440
Wait for me.

178
00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:46.940
Says, where is Harrison?

179
00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:49.600
I just transcoded the latest message.

180
00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:50.600
Listen.

181
00:11:50.600 --> 00:12:27.450
Miss Black, the ceremony is about to begin.

182
00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:30.389
Alice, every day, we're together.

183
00:12:30.389 --> 00:12:34.210
I feel like we get closer, which is so rare.

184
00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:35.210
I mean...

185
00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:37.500
Isn't Lisa's baby yours?

186
00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:38.500
No, of course not.

187
00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:40.500
I've ever found out, almost ruined everything.

188
00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:43.500
You make me so happy.

189
00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:45.940
What are you planning to do about Sebastian?

190
00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:47.139
A car accident.

191
00:12:47.139 --> 00:12:49.139
A lot of look like an accident.

192
00:12:49.139 --> 00:12:50.139
No one will ever know.

193
00:12:50.139 --> 00:12:51.139
Faster move.

194
00:12:51.139 --> 00:12:54.059
And Sebastian won't see it coming.

195
00:12:54.059 --> 00:12:56.059
He'll be gone for good.

196
00:12:56.059 --> 00:13:02.929
I love you, Alice.

197
00:13:02.929 --> 00:13:04.929
Sebastian got an accident.

198
00:13:04.929 --> 00:13:05.960
He's dying.

199
00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:14.450
How is he?

200
00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:16.450
He's not out of the woods yet.

201
00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:18.450
We're moving him to the ICU.

202
00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:20.450
The next 24 hours are critical.

203
00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:28.629
Sebastian dies when he might want to do.

204
00:13:28.629 --> 00:13:46.620
He's having a stroke.

205
00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:48.620
He's getting a doctor.

206
00:13:48.620 --> 00:14:18.559
Wake up, Sebastian.

207
00:14:18.559 --> 00:14:22.799
You don't get to check out.

208
00:14:22.799 --> 00:14:25.570
I need answers.

209
00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:32.179
Not with everything I've done said.

210
00:14:32.179 --> 00:14:37.340
I know about Harrison's plan.

211
00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:40.210
Why did you tell me?

212
00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:43.230
I know I misunderstood you.

213
00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:56.820
Since it's too late.

214
00:14:56.820 --> 00:15:07.870
You want me dead that badly?

215
00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:14.350
You're awake.

216
00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:16.350
I'm so sorry, Alice.

217
00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:19.570
Sorry about what?

218
00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:21.700
Your father.

219
00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:25.500
He helped me with a case.

220
00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:27.500
It upset the wrong people.

221
00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:30.620
They came after your family.

222
00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:33.820
They killed them.

223
00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:34.820
It wasn't.

224
00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:37.429
It was all because of me.

225
00:15:37.429 --> 00:15:42.269
He was buying this.

226
00:15:42.269 --> 00:15:44.269
Sebastian, please.

227
00:15:44.269 --> 00:15:53.120
You think this is the right tie for my

228
00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:57.980
CEO and odd girl speech tomorrow?

229
00:15:57.980 --> 00:15:59.139
Yeah.

230
00:15:59.139 --> 00:16:00.139
That's whatever you want.

231
00:16:00.139 --> 00:16:12.360
I managed to fool everyone.

232
00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:16.509
But you are your really naive.

233
00:16:16.509 --> 00:16:19.509
Pretending to love you has been torture.

234
00:16:19.509 --> 00:16:22.509
Just a little tramp who got knocked up by Sebastian.

235
00:16:22.509 --> 00:16:23.509
You made me, sir.

236
00:16:23.509 --> 00:16:24.509
I don't care.

237
00:16:24.509 --> 00:16:27.509
A little bastard in your belly still needs my money.

238
00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:29.509
You better behave yourself.

239
00:16:29.509 --> 00:16:51.929
Good morning, everyone.

240
00:16:51.929 --> 00:16:57.929
Today, I am honored to take on the role of CEO of Winkler Group.

241
00:16:57.929 --> 00:17:00.929
There are reports that your brother was supposed to fulfill the role.

242
00:17:00.929 --> 00:17:03.929
But he suffered a suspicious car accident.

243
00:17:03.929 --> 00:17:04.930
Do you have any comment?

244
00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:06.930
I'm not answering that.

245
00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:07.960
Next question.

246
00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:11.049
I have a question.

247
00:17:11.049 --> 00:17:14.049
What was your involvement in the Black family's death?

248
00:17:14.049 --> 00:17:17.230
What the hell are you talking about, Alex?

249
00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:18.230
Why are you crazy?

250
00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:19.230
No, I'm Harrison.

251
00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:20.390
I know it was you.

252
00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:23.539
You killed my parents.

253
00:17:23.539 --> 00:17:25.539
You framed Sebastian.

254
00:17:25.539 --> 00:17:27.539
That's nonsense.

255
00:17:27.539 --> 00:17:28.539
That's ridiculous.

256
00:17:28.539 --> 00:17:29.539
Where's your proof?

257
00:17:29.539 --> 00:17:30.539
I'm the proof.

258
00:17:30.539 --> 00:17:34.650
You try to kill me.

259
00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:36.650
Force Dad to sign a will.

260
00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:38.680
But guess what?

261
00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:39.970
We played you.

262
00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:48.000
You don't think I could hear everything when I faked my own stroke.

263
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:53.000
I heard every single word you and Edward have let me down in every possible way.

264
00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.130
I'm glad you're okay.

265
00:17:57.130 --> 00:18:01.130
This is all just a huge misunderstanding.

266
00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:03.130
I would never try to hurt you.

267
00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:04.130
I promise.

268
00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:07.130
I'm your favorite.

269
00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:09.130
I'm your youngest son.

270
00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:10.130
It was Edward.

271
00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:11.130
You know how he is.

272
00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:12.130
It wasn't me.

273
00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:13.130
You're still trying to spin this?

274
00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:16.700
Aren't you wondering where Edward is?

275
00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:18.700
He told us everything.

276
00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:26.559
He gave us all the proof.

277
00:18:26.559 --> 00:18:27.559
It's him.

278
00:18:27.559 --> 00:18:30.910
He's the one who told me to drug the blacks and turn on the gas valve.

279
00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:32.910
He promised me a million dollars and only gave me half.

280
00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:33.910
Motherfucker.

281
00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:34.910
It's you.

282
00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:38.059
You killed my parents.

283
00:18:38.059 --> 00:18:40.990
You pretended to be the nice guy.

284
00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:43.990
You pretended to care, but you're just a liar.

285
00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:46.309
You're worse than a liar.

286
00:18:46.309 --> 00:18:47.309
You're a murderer.

287
00:18:47.309 --> 00:18:49.309
I mean, it's Sebastian what?

288
00:18:49.309 --> 00:18:51.309
You're just shanks now?

289
00:18:51.309 --> 00:18:53.309
I mean, you think you're any better?

290
00:18:53.309 --> 00:18:55.309
You're justice dirty.

291
00:18:55.309 --> 00:18:58.309
You tried to kill your own brother Harrison.

292
00:18:58.309 --> 00:19:00.309
Your own brother.

293
00:19:00.309 --> 00:19:01.309
My brother.

294
00:19:01.309 --> 00:19:02.309
He's serious.

295
00:19:02.309 --> 00:19:03.309
He's not my brother.

296
00:19:03.309 --> 00:19:04.309
All right?

297
00:19:04.309 --> 00:19:05.309
I'm the heir.

298
00:19:05.309 --> 00:19:06.309
I'm the only heir.

299
00:19:06.309 --> 00:19:07.380
Nothing else matters.

300
00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:08.380
What are you doing?

301
00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:09.380
Hey, what are you doing?

302
00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:10.380
Get off of me.

303
00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:11.380
No, get off of me.

304
00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:13.380
I swear to God I'll kill you Sebastian.

305
00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:17.829
I'll kill you.

306
00:19:17.829 --> 00:19:19.470
Can we talk?

307
00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:22.779
Then brother.

308
00:19:22.779 --> 00:19:23.779
Mom.

309
00:19:23.779 --> 00:19:25.700
Dad.

310
00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:26.700
I found him.

311
00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:30.910
I found the man who murdered you.

312
00:19:30.910 --> 00:19:33.829
I was Harrison.

313
00:19:33.829 --> 00:19:39.700
Take care of Emma.

314
00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:47.750
You could finally rest.

315
00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:49.329
Sebastian.

316
00:19:49.329 --> 00:19:52.329
I treated you so terribly.

317
00:19:52.329 --> 00:19:55.329
If I could go back and get to know you for all.

318
00:19:55.329 --> 00:20:00.079
Let's start over.

319
00:20:00.079 --> 00:20:01.079
Forget everything.

320
00:20:01.079 --> 00:20:03.339
Let's meet each other again.

321
00:20:03.339 --> 00:20:04.880
Properly.

322
00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:05.880
This time.

323
00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:09.150
I'm house black.

324
00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:12.690
I'm Sebastian Winkler.

325
00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:14.170
Trust me.
