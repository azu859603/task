00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:08,060
Mary? You want me to get married? I did not come back to America for this.

2
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:14,060
Selena, this isn't just anybody that you would be marrying. It's Nick Branson. He's a billionaire.

3
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:20,059
So are you? Isn't that enough? I am not some piece of property that you can just sell, dad. Absolutely not.

4
00:00:20,059 --> 00:00:23,160
Well, that's too late. Too late?

5
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:29,949
He's your fiancé. My what? Indeed, I've already arranged it.

6
00:00:29,949 --> 00:00:37,109
I feel like in America I have never even seen. Dad, I just graduated. I need the free to pursue my dreams of becoming a fashion designer.

7
00:00:37,109 --> 00:00:44,560
You can do that. What do you mean? I've given this much thought.

8
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:54,909
It's a contract. Nick Branson owns JS Jewelry. Under the contract, you will work there as an intern designer, remaining as his fiancé.

9
00:00:54,909 --> 00:01:06,739
And after three months, you're free to do as you wish. JS Jewelry, the high-end fashion brand, doesn't get much better than JS Jewelry.

10
00:01:06,739 --> 00:01:14,260
And if I wish to not marry him? As long as you complete the three months. Deal.

11
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:23,989
But under one condition, I need to develop my career base on my talent, not my name.

12
00:01:23,989 --> 00:01:30,989
So, I want to keep my identity a secret. I don't want anyone knowing that I'm Selena Murphy.

13
00:01:30,989 --> 00:01:38,950
Instead, I will go by. Selena Collins.
