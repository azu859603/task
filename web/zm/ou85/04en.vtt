00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
You promised to keep my identity at J.S. Jewelry a secret?

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.700
Yes.

3
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:19.149
Thanks, Don.

4
00:00:19.149 --> 00:00:22.250
Mr. Murphy, with all due respect,

5
00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.649
why do you want to force your daughter,

6
00:00:24.649 --> 00:00:27.649
the heiress to the Murphy family,

7
00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:30.250
into marrying Nick Branson?

8
00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.450
Quite frankly, he came from nothing.

9
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.750
You wouldn't have been able to establish his empire,

10
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.950
that alone had become a billionaire.

11
00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.549
It's really him that owes you.

12
00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:43.850
I'm aware of that, John.

13
00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.109
Nick, he's a fine young man.

14
00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:49.710
I just know that two of them will work out.

15
00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.340
I understand.

16
00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.210
Three months in the same office should do the trial.

17
00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.109
And, speaking of, John,

18
00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.909
what should you call Nick Branson tomorrow?

19
00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:04.030
Let him know that my daughter will be working for him.

20
00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:11.689
Yes, sir.

21
00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:12.689
Good morning, Miss Selena.

22
00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.489
Your father instructed me to drive you to work.

23
00:01:14.489 --> 00:01:17.519
Oh, thanks.

24
00:01:17.519 --> 00:01:27.819
I'll drag myself.

25
00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:29.819
Good morning, McBranson's office.

26
00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:32.180
Oh, hey, John.

27
00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.379
Sorry, I'm afraid Mr. Branson is a little busy at the moment.

28
00:01:36.379 --> 00:01:40.239
Miss Murphy will be our intern.

29
00:01:40.239 --> 00:01:41.640
Are you serious?

30
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.239
George Murphy's daughter will be our new intern.
