1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:02,209
Are you serious?

2
00:00:02,209 --> 00:00:04,769
George Murphy's daughter will be our new intern?

3
00:00:04,769 --> 00:00:06,790
Okay, goodbye.

4
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:07,990
Did I hear that right?

5
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:10,390
The billionaire George Murphy?

6
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:11,390
Yes.

7
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:12,550
God damn it.

8
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:15,990
Oh, the Murphy era is working for us.

9
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:17,629
That's crazy.

10
00:00:17,629 --> 00:00:19,230
I don't get it.

11
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:21,829
What would a billionaire's daughter intern here?

12
00:00:21,829 --> 00:00:23,800
That's why we're so upset.

13
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,160
Isn't that a good thing?

14
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,239
You dumb bimbo.

15
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:27,960
She's the CEO's fiance.

16
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,679
Oh shit.

17
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,359
That means our CEO is going to know everything

18
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,280
about what's happening in our department.

19
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,840
What are we going to do?

20
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,299
Treat her like a queen, you fool.

21
00:00:38,299 --> 00:00:40,380
I wouldn't be surprised if the CEO is sending her here

22
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,420
to spy on us.

23
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:43,380
You know it could be a good thing.

24
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,060
You make a good impression on her.

25
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:46,500
She could promote you.

26
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,060
At least one of you is thinking.

27
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:49,179
Quick, get me her name.

28
00:00:49,179 --> 00:00:57,200
Now, HR didn't specify any names.

29
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,880
It just says that we have two new interns here today,

30
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,759
meaning one of them must be Ms. Murphy.

31
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:05,379
So too, HR.

32
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:07,140
What are you two still sitting there for?

33
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:15,540
We have to go pick her up.

34
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:16,859
Oh, he's that hurt.

35
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:18,379
Are you stupid, Emma?

36
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:19,739
What kind of billionaire daughter

37
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:23,569
would be driving a shitty car like that?

38
00:01:23,569 --> 00:01:25,129
That's funny.
