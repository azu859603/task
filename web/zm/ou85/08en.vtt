00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.540
How dare you call my $10,000 bag of fake?

2
00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:06.240
Yeah, you've probably seen one of those

3
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.599
with your own two eyes.

4
00:00:07.599 --> 00:00:09.539
Actually, I have.

5
00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:13.039
I used to own it and that's a fake.

6
00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:15.480
If you look at the handles,

7
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.199
there should be mustard yellow stitching,

8
00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:20.140
not bright yellow.

9
00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.420
And there should also be five stitches

10
00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:23.980
going across in all directions.

11
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.780
Well, that's actually true.

12
00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.179
I've heard about that.

13
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.859
And this one has six.

14
00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:32.939
Oof.

15
00:00:32.939 --> 00:00:34.179
Told ya.

16
00:00:34.179 --> 00:00:35.100
Shut up Emma.

17
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.979
It's probably a limited edition bag.

18
00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:38.859
Yeah, it is a limited edition.

19
00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:40.710
Okay.

20
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.189
That's not really adding up

21
00:00:42.189 --> 00:00:44.070
because if it were a limited edition,

22
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.509
there wouldn't be a seam going through

23
00:00:45.509 --> 00:00:47.479
the bottom of the bag.

24
00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:51.359
I mean, anyone who knows anything about fashion bags

25
00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:54.159
knows that you would never divide the bottom

26
00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:55.479
with a seam.

27
00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:57.119
You make the bottom seamless.

28
00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:57.960
It's okay.

29
00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.679
You don't have to be embarrassed.

30
00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:11.189
Just know that that's a fake.

31
00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.189
Excuse me.
