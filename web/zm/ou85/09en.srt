1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:03,649
Excuse me.

2
00:00:03,649 --> 00:00:14,830
I really hope he doesn't recognize me.

3
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:18,019
Mind your business.

4
00:00:18,019 --> 00:00:20,019
Mind my business.

5
00:00:20,019 --> 00:00:22,019
Who do you think you are?

6
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:23,399
Sir.

7
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:25,399
That's George Murphy's daughter.

8
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:29,670
Maybe I'll tell you.

9
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,670
Why don't you fuck off?

10
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:32,770
Whoa.

11
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:35,990
She's cussing out her CEO.

12
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:37,990
George Murphy's daughter is...

13
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:39,979
What?

14
00:00:39,979 --> 00:00:40,979
He must be into that type.

15
00:00:40,979 --> 00:00:42,979
It'll make for an interesting marriage.

16
00:00:42,979 --> 00:00:45,500
Thank you.

17
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,359
Um...

18
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:52,359
Miss Murphy, this is Nick Branson, our CEO,

19
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:57,109
and your fiancee.

20
00:00:57,109 --> 00:00:58,109
Fiance?

21
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:02,700
CEO.

22
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,700
Who the hell is this as Murphy?

23
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,700
A billionaire father and a billionaire fiance?

24
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,700
How am I going to pretend to be her in front of him?

25
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:12,409
Oh my God, I'm so screwed.

26
00:01:12,409 --> 00:01:14,409
He's my fiancee.
