1
00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.459
Hey, that was so weird.

2
00:00:03.459 --> 00:00:08.140
RCA was super cold towards you, and he's your fiance.

3
00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:11.050
He probably just had a stressful morning.

4
00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:12.529
Yeah, but see, I don't think so,

5
00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:15.490
because he was super nice with Selena,

6
00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:16.769
and she's like a new buddy.

7
00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:18.850
Emma, shut your mouth.

8
00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:21.160
You dirty gossip, get to work.

9
00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.250
Actually, that's a good point, Emma.

10
00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.170
I mean, it would be understandable

11
00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.050
if you'd never met your fiance,

12
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.289
but actually not really.

13
00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.289
Because then, how would you not know

14
00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:36.490
that your fiance is also the CEO of this company?

15
00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:40.090
Don't talk to me like that, you sniveling snot face.

16
00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.609
I can't get you fired like in the back.

17
00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:44.890
Okay, I'm sorry.

18
00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:46.250
Grace, you're right.

19
00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.649
You know what?

20
00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:52.369
It'd be really cool if we got to meet your father,

21
00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:53.890
George Murphy.

22
00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.689
Wow, finally, Selena hasn't a good idea.

23
00:00:57.689 --> 00:00:59.689
That actually would be amazing, Grace.

24
00:00:59.689 --> 00:01:01.289
That's what could happen.

25
00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.810
Yes, that would be amazing.

26
00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:08.340
I've never met a real billionaire before.

27
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.859
But she's really busy, you know,

28
00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:13.340
traveling around the world,

29
00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.829
doing Billy and their things.

30
00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:19.900
Yeah, but are you his only daughter?

31
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.390
Sure, he could make time for you, right?

32
00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.980
He's busy, okay?

33
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.579
I guess the best thing about how to have some father

34
00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:31.819
is that you get the entire wheelchair into yourself.

35
00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:34.379
Man, she's, we have three.

36
00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:37.890
Mom, and it's perfect.

37
00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.010
Maybe you could invite us up for some time.

38
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.010
That would actually be amazing, Grace.

39
00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:43.129
Let's do it, Grace.

40
00:01:43.129 --> 00:01:44.129
How about tomorrow?

41
00:01:44.129 --> 00:01:45.530
It's Saturday.

42
00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:46.370
Up.

43
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.090
Sure.

44
00:01:50.049 --> 00:02:10.120
Do you know I can make a quick call?

45
00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.599
All right, I was just thinking about you.

46
00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:15.310
Mom, shut up, I need your help.

47
00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.229
Mom, shut up, I need your help.

48
00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:19.430
Are you still working at the Murphy mansions?

49
00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.229
Yes, I'm here right now at the Calabasas one.

50
00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:25.990
And is the Murphy family going to be there tomorrow?

51
00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.110
No, sweetheart, they haven't been here for over a month.

52
00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.819
Perfect.

53
00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:32.620
I'm gonna need you to do me a favor.

54
00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.849
You're gonna open the door to the mansion,

55
00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:36.449
coming over with some work colleagues

56
00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:38.969
and meet a show in the place.

57
00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:43.689
Sweetheart, I don't think that's the wisest thing to do.

58
00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:46.569
Mom, don't be a bitch.

59
00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:49.930
Maybe, it's just that I don't wanna get fired.

60
00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.020
If you love me, you want me to do well at this job.

61
00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.659
You're gonna do this for me.

62
00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:58.860
Fine.

63
00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:12.110
Good.

64
00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:20.699
Just drop the address in the group chat.

65
00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:32.550
5800 West Shore Road, that's our Calabasas home.

66
00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:39.930
Selena, first day of the books.

67
00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.379
I hold up.

68
00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:44.729
I'm good, thanks for asking.

69
00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:46.409
Well, I'll see you later.

70
00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:48.949
I know who you are.

71
00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:52.520
Oh no, he knows.

72
00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.000
You do?

73
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.349
Sure do.

74
00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:01.620
At the airport, at the bathroom.

75
00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.520
Oh thank God, he's talking about the airport.

76
00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.379
I'm not sure that I follow.

77
00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:10.360
You don't remember?

78
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.039
Dressed differently and we upped.

79
00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:13.280
And we...

80
00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.139
We kissed.

81
00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:18.829
In an airport bathroom?

82
00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:20.870
Sounds a little crazy to me.

83
00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.259
I think you might be mixing up your interns.

84
00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:24.860
Sorry, that wasn't me.

85
00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:42.819
I'm not even gonna tell me how your first day went.

86
00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:43.860
What?

87
00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.680
What did I do now?

88
00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.360
Didn't keep your word.

89
00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.240
You said you were gonna keep my identity a secret.

90
00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.420
That's exactly what I did.

91
00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.019
I only notified Nick's office

92
00:04:55.019 --> 00:04:57.620
so that they could take care of you.

93
00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.490
I did everyone know.

94
00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.490
Selena, come on, just tell me what happened at work today.

95
00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.829
I just can't stand the people there.

96
00:05:05.829 --> 00:05:08.269
They're all a bunch of superficial jerks.

97
00:05:08.269 --> 00:05:14.100
I'll go start thinking about quitting now.

98
00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:19.220
You have three months to go.

99
00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:27.100
Remember, you signed a contract.

100
00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.160
Welcome ladies.

101
00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.160
Whoa.

102
00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.050
What a beautiful medium, Grace.

103
00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:34.050
It's lovely.

104
00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:35.139
Thanks.

105
00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:36.139
I know.

106
00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:37.139
Come right this way.

107
00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:53.180
The daughter of a billionaire would have to enter her own mansion.

108
00:05:53.180 --> 00:06:00.379
I never thought the daughter of a billionaire would have to enter her own mansion through

109
00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:01.379
the side door.

110
00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:05.339
There's a very good reason that we entered through the side door.

111
00:06:05.339 --> 00:06:07.259
And what is that?

112
00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:11.389
Um, you don't have to answer that, Grace.

113
00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:12.829
She's just jealous.

114
00:06:12.829 --> 00:06:13.829
So sad.

115
00:06:13.829 --> 00:06:15.629
Yeah, no pay attention to her, Grace.

116
00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:24.769
She wishes that she could live in a mansion like this.

117
00:06:24.769 --> 00:06:26.769
You must know.

118
00:06:26.769 --> 00:06:28.689
This is the garden path.

119
00:06:28.689 --> 00:06:43.220
Right.

120
00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:44.500
Beautiful backyard.

121
00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.970
It's gorgeous.

122
00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:48.970
It's gorgeous backyard ever.

123
00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:55.019
Hey.

124
00:06:55.019 --> 00:06:56.019
Gardener.

125
00:06:56.019 --> 00:06:58.089
You don't even know his name.

126
00:06:58.089 --> 00:06:59.089
Why should I?

127
00:06:59.089 --> 00:07:00.089
He's just a poor gardener.

128
00:07:00.089 --> 00:07:01.220
Great job, Mommy.

129
00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:03.220
You've got the gardener to greet me.

130
00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:05.220
Come on, girls.

131
00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:06.220
Let's go inside.

132
00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:31.379
Can you turn it on?

133
00:07:31.379 --> 00:07:33.759
I want to see it on.

134
00:07:33.759 --> 00:07:56.329
Dad.

135
00:07:56.329 --> 00:08:03.699
That's a TV remote.

136
00:08:03.699 --> 00:08:07.699
Chins, I just, you know, get confused where the switches are.

137
00:08:07.699 --> 00:08:10.500
Yeah, I don't really think you're dealing with the switch here.

138
00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:12.259
What do you know?

139
00:08:12.259 --> 00:08:14.259
Don't you have a smart home system?

140
00:08:14.259 --> 00:08:15.540
What?

141
00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:21.439
What?

142
00:08:21.439 --> 00:08:22.439
Yes.

143
00:08:22.439 --> 00:08:38.960
I hear you.

144
00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:39.960
Smart home.

145
00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:41.960
Turn on the fireplace.

146
00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:51.700
Yes.

147
00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:55.820
Could you please turn on the fireplace?

148
00:08:55.820 --> 00:09:04.340
Definitely.

149
00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:06.340
Why did you not recognize your voice?

150
00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:09.460
Better recognize Selena.

151
00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:14.529
Because I have a cold and the system doesn't recognize your voice when you're cold.

152
00:09:14.529 --> 00:09:17.529
And Grace and Selena have similar voices.

153
00:09:17.529 --> 00:09:21.379
What are you laughing at?

154
00:09:21.379 --> 00:09:26.379
I mean, I know this might sound a little bit crazy, but is this actually your home?

155
00:09:26.379 --> 00:09:34.700
What are you trying to say?

156
00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:36.820
Excuse me, ladies.

157
00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:38.820
May I offer you all a beverage?

158
00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:39.820
You know what?

159
00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:40.820
I won't stand for this.

160
00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:45.419
Girls, come here.

161
00:09:45.419 --> 00:09:48.419
Susan, tell my friends I'm the Murphy-Aras.

162
00:09:48.419 --> 00:09:59.429
You drunk?

163
00:09:59.429 --> 00:10:01.620
Miss Murphy.

164
00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:03.620
Why are you looking at her?

165
00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:07.399
Look at me.

166
00:10:07.399 --> 00:10:16.779
Or look at me.

167
00:10:16.779 --> 00:10:18.779
To tell my friends who I am.

168
00:10:18.779 --> 00:10:20.360
So?

169
00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:25.750
You're Miss Murphy.

170
00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:26.750
Daughter of...

171
00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:28.820
Daughter of George Murphy.

172
00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:32.000
Are you sure?

173
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.100
What do you mean, is she sure?

174
00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:39.100
I am so sorry you're having to deal with this nonsense.

175
00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:42.100
It was an absolute mistake bringing this brat along.

176
00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:43.100
It's official.

177
00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:45.100
We're deleting you from the group chat.

178
00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:51.100
Well, I'm just not sure that you're the right person to confirm whether or not Grace is the Murphy-Aras.

179
00:10:52.129 --> 00:10:54.129
Maybe we should contact George Murphy's assistant.

180
00:10:54.129 --> 00:10:56.129
We should be here, shouldn't we?

181
00:10:56.129 --> 00:10:57.129
Are you crazy?

182
00:10:57.129 --> 00:10:59.769
Do you know his name?

183
00:10:59.769 --> 00:11:03.700
Um, that's what I thought.

184
00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:04.700
His name is John.

185
00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:05.700
Don Wood.

186
00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:07.700
Of course I know John Wood.

187
00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:09.700
He's my dad's assistant.

188
00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:10.700
That's what I thought.

189
00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:12.700
His name is Don Wood.

190
00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:14.700
Of course I know John Wood's.

191
00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:16.759
He's my dad's assistant.

192
00:11:16.759 --> 00:11:17.759
Cool.

193
00:11:17.759 --> 00:11:18.759
Then why don't you call him?

194
00:11:18.759 --> 00:11:21.759
If you really want to prove your George Murphy's daughter.

195
00:11:21.759 --> 00:11:25.860
Actually, Grace, I think this is an amazing idea.

196
00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:28.860
That way we can prove Celina that she is wrong.

197
00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:30.860
Yeah, do it Grace.

198
00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:31.860
Show her who's wrong.

199
00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:32.860
Okay, fine.

200
00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:37.419
Susan, go find John.

201
00:11:37.419 --> 00:11:40.419
I'm sorry, I don't know where he's at.

202
00:11:40.419 --> 00:11:44.120
Bitch, call him then.

203
00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:47.120
I'm sorry, but I don't have his number.

204
00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:50.299
You call him.

205
00:11:50.299 --> 00:11:53.299
Because I just got a new phone and I don't have his number saved.

206
00:11:53.299 --> 00:11:58.379
That's okay.

207
00:11:58.379 --> 00:12:01.570
There's no way she's actually calling him here.

208
00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:02.570
Hi, John.

209
00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:05.570
Are you near the Calabasas Murphy mansion?

210
00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:09.269
Oh, you're already on the property.

211
00:12:09.269 --> 00:12:10.269
That's perfect.

212
00:12:10.269 --> 00:12:13.370
What do you mind swinging by the living room?

213
00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:14.370
Awesome.

214
00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:21.789
There's no way she just called him line garbage girl.

215
00:12:21.789 --> 00:12:24.789
Yeah, she probably just called customer service.

216
00:12:24.789 --> 00:12:25.789
Are you sure about that?

217
00:12:25.789 --> 00:12:31.789
I'm so sure that if he actually shows up, I'll crawl on the floor and break like a doggy.

218
00:12:31.789 --> 00:12:32.789
Oh, really?

219
00:12:32.789 --> 00:12:33.789
Mm-hmm.

220
00:12:33.789 --> 00:12:43.860
So, Laina, great to see you.

221
00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:46.860
Ladies, this is John Woods.

222
00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:49.860
He's not my father's assistant.

223
00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:55.450
This is how Murphy's assistant.

224
00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:58.450
But he can't even recognize his daughter.

225
00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:00.580
Oh, Lord, Laina.

226
00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:03.580
Did you actually hire an actor?

227
00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:04.580
How much did you pay you?

228
00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:05.580
Fifty bucks.

229
00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:06.580
Excuse me?

230
00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:07.580
You hurt me.

231
00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:09.580
You hobo.

232
00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:31.990
And you, claiming to be George Murphy's daughter, I should call the police on you this instant.

233
00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:35.730
Um, actually, that's really him.

234
00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:40.139
Look, this is George Murphy's right here, man.

235
00:13:40.139 --> 00:13:41.139
What am I doing?

236
00:13:41.139 --> 00:13:44.139
I can't expose Grace right now to find out who I really am.

237
00:13:44.139 --> 00:13:46.100
Hey, John.

238
00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:50.200
Could you actually pretend that she's the real Miss Murphy?

239
00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:51.580
No.

240
00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:53.639
Are you sure?

241
00:13:53.639 --> 00:13:59.419
How can you not recognize your own father's assistant?

242
00:13:59.419 --> 00:14:02.789
Your face.

243
00:14:02.789 --> 00:14:04.500
Miss Murphy.

244
00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:07.879
I'm so sorry I didn't recognize you.

245
00:14:07.879 --> 00:14:09.879
I didn't put in my contacts this morning.

246
00:14:09.879 --> 00:14:12.879
And you look different somehow, uh, prettier, perhaps.

247
00:14:12.879 --> 00:14:14.879
Please forgive me.

248
00:14:14.879 --> 00:14:15.879
It's all right.

249
00:14:15.879 --> 00:14:16.879
You're forgiven.

250
00:14:16.879 --> 00:14:20.070
I guess I didn't recognize you either.

251
00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:22.070
It's been a while.

252
00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:33.350
I think it's really a beer lost a bet.

253
00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:40.889
Somebody here lost a bet.

254
00:14:40.889 --> 00:14:46.340
I'm so sure that if he actually shows up with a problem in the floor and...

255
00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:54.389
I'm sorry, but it was more bad.

256
00:14:54.389 --> 00:14:57.549
Grace, it was a misunderstanding.

257
00:14:57.549 --> 00:14:58.549
Great.

258
00:14:58.549 --> 00:15:00.740
No one forced you to make the bad.

259
00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:02.740
You did lose.

260
00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:06.090
Hey, it is what it is.

261
00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:11.360
We honor our bets in this house.

262
00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:24.029
We honor our bets in this house.

263
00:15:24.029 --> 00:16:08.490
I should never have allowed my daughter to impersonate you.

264
00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:10.490
Grace is your daughter?

265
00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:13.379
Yes.

266
00:16:13.379 --> 00:16:14.379
Difficult.

267
00:16:14.379 --> 00:16:15.500
So sorry.

268
00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:18.820
How is her last name also Murphy?

269
00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:28.009
She changed her last name to Murphy three years ago.

270
00:16:28.009 --> 00:16:29.009
Fuck off.

271
00:16:29.009 --> 00:16:39.990
You're fired.

272
00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:43.149
You can keep your job, but under one condition.

273
00:16:43.149 --> 00:16:44.149
Yes.

274
00:16:44.149 --> 00:16:45.149
Anything.

275
00:16:45.149 --> 00:16:48.149
You won't tell Grace or anybody else who I am.

276
00:16:48.149 --> 00:16:51.429
Who I really...

277
00:16:51.429 --> 00:16:52.429
Yes.

278
00:16:52.429 --> 00:16:53.429
Of course, Miss Murphy.

279
00:16:53.429 --> 00:16:54.429
You can get up now.

280
00:16:54.429 --> 00:16:56.590
Thank you, Miss Murphy.

281
00:16:56.590 --> 00:16:59.059
Wait.

282
00:16:59.059 --> 00:17:01.580
How did Selena get John's number?

283
00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:02.580
Yeah.

284
00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:05.579
And also, why is she friends with George Murphy's assistant?

285
00:17:05.579 --> 00:17:07.579
And why is she still inside?

286
00:17:07.579 --> 00:17:08.579
Uh...

287
00:17:08.579 --> 00:17:14.299
You couldn't tell, but it's so obvious.

288
00:17:14.299 --> 00:17:18.700
Selena is John's mistress.

289
00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:23.329
Oh, so much sense now.

290
00:17:23.329 --> 00:17:24.329
Oh.

291
00:17:24.329 --> 00:17:37.329
You scared me.

292
00:17:37.329 --> 00:17:39.619
Baby, I worry for you.

293
00:17:39.619 --> 00:17:42.619
You've got to stop this right now.

294
00:17:42.619 --> 00:17:44.619
You can't continue doing this.

295
00:17:44.619 --> 00:17:46.619
I'm doing what?

296
00:17:46.619 --> 00:17:48.619
Pretending to be a Murphy.

297
00:17:48.619 --> 00:17:50.859
Shh.

298
00:17:50.859 --> 00:17:52.859
Baby, you're playing with fire.

299
00:17:52.859 --> 00:17:54.859
This won't end well if you keep at it.

300
00:17:54.859 --> 00:17:55.859
Are you?

301
00:17:55.859 --> 00:17:57.759
No.

302
00:17:57.759 --> 00:17:59.920
Of course not, sweetheart.

303
00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:01.920
I want what's best for you.

304
00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:03.920
I want you to realize who you are.

305
00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:04.920
Oh, yeah.

306
00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:05.920
You know who I am?

307
00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:07.920
Who am I?

308
00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.920
I know you're not the daughter of some billionaire.

309
00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:10.920
Yeah.

310
00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:11.920
You don't have to remind me.

311
00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:14.920
My parents are a maid in a security guard.

312
00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:16.920
There's nothing wrong with that.

313
00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:17.920
Are you kidding?

314
00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:18.920
It's pathetic.

315
00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:21.920
You two have ruined my life.

316
00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:34.660
All right, ladies.

317
00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:39.660
I have a high profile client that needs 20 design proposals by next month.

318
00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:41.660
Who's up for it?

319
00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:42.660
I can't.

320
00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:44.660
I already have several accounts I'm working on.

321
00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:45.660
I can't.

322
00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:47.660
I'm visiting her proposals.

323
00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:49.660
How about Selena?

324
00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:51.660
She does practically nothing.

325
00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:53.660
I'm surprised you guys even pay her.

326
00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:54.660
I'd love to.

327
00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:55.660
I'll do it.

328
00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:56.660
All right.

329
00:18:56.660 --> 00:19:02.539
And by when do you need this next month?

330
00:19:02.539 --> 00:19:03.539
Next month.

331
00:19:03.539 --> 00:19:04.539
Oh, no.

332
00:19:04.539 --> 00:19:06.640
I need them by tomorrow morning.

333
00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:10.369
But you just said next month.

334
00:19:10.369 --> 00:19:12.369
No, I'm pretty sure I said tomorrow morning.

335
00:19:12.369 --> 00:19:13.369
Right, girls?

336
00:19:13.369 --> 00:19:15.369
She said tomorrow morning.

337
00:19:15.369 --> 00:19:18.329
Oh.

338
00:19:18.329 --> 00:19:21.390
And if you don't have it for me, first thing tomorrow morning,

339
00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:22.390
you're fired.

340
00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:23.390
Bye, Selena.

341
00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:43.849
It was nice.

342
00:19:43.849 --> 00:19:44.849
No matter.

343
00:19:44.849 --> 00:19:47.849
And you get fired eventually.

344
00:19:47.849 --> 00:19:48.880
This fast.

345
00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:52.059
Good luck with your next job, Selena.

346
00:19:52.059 --> 00:19:53.059
What's she still doing here?

347
00:19:53.059 --> 00:21:15.900
I thought she was fired.

348
00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:16.900
Gross.

349
00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:18.900
She's still wearing yesterday's outfit.

350
00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:20.900
I think I can smell her from here.

351
00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:21.900
Selena?

352
00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:22.900
I think she's drunk.

353
00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:23.900
Selena.

354
00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:29.990
You were able to finish the assignment.

355
00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:30.990
Fire.

356
00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:33.410
No, I completed it.

357
00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:34.410
You what?

358
00:21:34.410 --> 00:21:39.609
Here you go.

359
00:21:39.609 --> 00:21:43.369
Design proposals.

360
00:21:43.369 --> 00:21:51.220
I'll be in the break room if you need me.

361
00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:52.220
Oh shit.

362
00:21:52.220 --> 00:22:01.900
Those proposals probably suck.

363
00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:04.279
Yeah, no one there in the gym.

364
00:22:04.279 --> 00:22:06.759
No, they're actually pretty good.

365
00:22:06.759 --> 00:22:07.759
Grace?

366
00:22:07.759 --> 00:22:11.910
Who'd you like to get some brownie coins with your fiance?

367
00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:12.910
Thank you.

368
00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:17.180
Can I come in?

369
00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:18.180
Do you have to?

370
00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:32.140
You're funny.

371
00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:35.029
I just wanted to show you all the work I've been up to.

372
00:22:35.029 --> 00:22:36.289
What work?

373
00:22:36.289 --> 00:22:37.289
The proposals.

374
00:22:37.289 --> 00:22:39.509
Are you kidding me?

375
00:22:39.509 --> 00:22:42.539
Well, aren't you going to look at them?

376
00:22:42.539 --> 00:22:48.880
And you did.

377
00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:49.880
All these proposals.
