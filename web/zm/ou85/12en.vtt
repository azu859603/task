00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:06.860
So what do you think? Grace, will you excuse me? I have a meeting in a few

2
00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:12.900
minutes. It's all Selena's fault she did a shit job on this. It's the same door you

3
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:28.320
came in. Look, you're a little homeless intern finally changed clothes. Jess, did Caitlyn say Selena had

4
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:37.219
a mop duty tonight? Oh my god. I think that's exactly what she said. Well, you heard her. Get to work.

5
00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:43.539
Girl, you need to relax. This whole bullying act you've got going on? It's not gonna work for me.

6
00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:48.340
Just because you've gone from a billionaire family doesn't mean that you get to talk to me like this.

7
00:00:48.340 --> 00:01:06.780
So shut your truck. Okay? Hey peasant girl. Look at me. I said you got mop duty. What is wrong with you?

8
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:18.000
What? Did I do something wrong? I didn't see anything. I mean neither. You want me to get to work?
