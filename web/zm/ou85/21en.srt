1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,209
These two are with me.

2
00:00:03,209 --> 00:00:04,209
Oh man.

3
00:00:04,209 --> 00:00:05,209
I can't let you enter through here.

4
00:00:05,209 --> 00:00:07,209
This is the VIP entrance only.

5
00:00:07,209 --> 00:00:09,210
And I'm VIP.

6
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,210
Invitation is not a VIP invite.

7
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,210
What?

8
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:15,210
Oh.

9
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:17,210
How could you do this to me dad?

10
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:19,210
I told you VIP.

11
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:20,210
Sorry.

12
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:23,210
You can exit right here and you'll see it.

13
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:25,210
It's a very long line.

14
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:26,210
You can't miss it.

15
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:29,210
So you and your friends can enter over there.

16
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,210
I'm Grace Murphy.

17
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,210
Do you know who I am?

18
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:36,210
I don't care who you are.

19
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,210
You can't come through.

20
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:42,229
How does territory just daughter?

21
00:00:42,229 --> 00:00:44,229
Does nobody have papers?

22
00:00:44,229 --> 00:00:45,229
I don't remember something.

23
00:00:45,229 --> 00:00:47,229
It's not a hat or a hat.

24
00:00:47,229 --> 00:00:55,530
What's this chicken head doing in the VIP line?

25
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,530
Step aside ladies.

26
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:03,109
Step aside.

27
00:01:03,109 --> 00:01:04,109
Welcome in.

28
00:01:04,109 --> 00:01:07,870
Right this way.

29
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:10,870
I wonder who should sleep with to get that invite.

30
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:11,870
Excuse me sir.

31
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:13,870
Her invitation is a fake.

32
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:14,870
I need you guys to move along.

33
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:15,870
Okay.

34
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:17,870
I already told you your entrance is over there.
