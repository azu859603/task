00:00:01,419 --> 00:00:03,419
Nick, what are you doing?

2
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:06,740
I think it's me. We should be asking you that question.

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,740
It's her fault. She's the one pretending to be someone she's not.

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:13,740
It's true. She cheated her way into the event with a fake invite.

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:18,739
Yeah. She could ever afford to be here. She's a beggar at best. She belongs outside.

6
00:00:18,739 --> 00:00:22,190
Selena belongs here. I invited her.

7
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:29,739
What? If you want to get married to me, you need to kick her out.

8
00:00:29,739 --> 00:00:31,739
No.

9
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:33,350
Oh, yeah?

10
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:34,350
Yeah?

11
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:39,619
Do I know how you want to embarrass yourself? For all these people.

12
00:00:39,619 --> 00:00:46,740
Ben, I've been looking for you all over. Get off my man.
