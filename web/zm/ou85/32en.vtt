1
00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:02.319
I know what you did, you fool.

2
00:00:02.319 --> 00:00:04.839
You think you can just lock someone in a bathroom like that?

3
00:00:04.839 --> 00:00:06.919
I almost died because of you.

4
00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:08.060
You're in deep shit.

5
00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:09.640
I'm the Murphy-Eris.

6
00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.039
My dad's a cajillion-air.

7
00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:12.539
He's gonna smite you.

8
00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:14.890
See?

9
00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:18.980
You're Joey.

10
00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.140
Come check this.

11
00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:29.480
The Murphy-Eris is gonna beat down.

12
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.980
Where's my daughter?

13
00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.280
I'm gonna kill whoever laid a hand on her.

14
00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.109
Oh my god, is that George Murphy?

15
00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:40.509
Yes, that's George Murphy.

16
00:00:40.509 --> 00:00:41.909
Poor baby.

17
00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:51.100
Where is your daddy?

18
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.799
I'm not my daughter.

19
00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:54.799
I didn't know you were coming.

20
00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:55.799
Selena.

21
00:00:55.799 --> 00:01:00.619
You two-time gold digging whore.

22
00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:06.609
First you sleep with the old fart and now with the grandpa.

23
00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:08.209
She's definitely a floozy.

24
00:01:08.209 --> 00:01:10.609
First with the assistant, now with the billionaire?

25
00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:12.609
She has absolutely no shame.

26
00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:14.109
So gross.

27
00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:15.500
Disgusting.

28
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:22.519
You can just spread false rumors.

29
00:01:22.519 --> 00:01:25.480
That's your comeuppance.

30
00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.480
Little rat face.

31
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.760
What the hell do you think you're doing here?

32
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:35.069
Mr. Murphy, there is no way in hell I'm marrying her daughter.

33
00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:38.319
She's a stuck-up rat and a boy.

34
00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:39.319
Get her out of my vet.

35
00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:43.359
You think you can talk about my daughter like that?

36
00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:45.459
Dad, he's talking about Grace.

37
00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:46.459
What?

38
00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:47.859
No, he's talking about you.

39
00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:48.859
No!

40
00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:49.859
Her!

41
00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:50.859
She's an imposter!

42
00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:52.659
She's pretending to be your daughter.

43
00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:56.379
Me.

44
00:01:56.379 --> 00:01:57.379
That was George Murphy.

45
00:01:57.379 --> 00:01:58.379
You're insulting.

46
00:01:58.379 --> 00:01:59.379
I just wanted to let you.

47
00:01:59.379 --> 00:02:00.379
That's George Murphy.

48
00:02:00.379 --> 00:02:01.379
He says so.

49
00:02:01.379 --> 00:02:03.790
Oh my god.

50
00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:04.790
Wait.

51
00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.319
I gotta get out of here.

52
00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:09.319
Grace?

53
00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:10.319
Grace?

54
00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.509
Grace.

55
00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:12.509
Grace.

56
00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:15.009
You have to clear all of this up with your father.

57
00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:16.009
Oh yeah, just a second.

58
00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:17.009
I have to go to the bathroom.

59
00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:18.009
No.

60
00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:19.009
Me.

61
00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:20.009
Go talk to him.

62
00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:21.009
Oh, not right now.

63
00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:22.009
Mr. Murphy.

64
00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:23.009
Your daughter needs to speak to you.

65
00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:24.430
Your daughter.

66
00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.699
Hi, Dad.

67
00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:28.699
Dad.

68
00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:33.360
I'm not your fucking dad.

69
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.319
What the hell are you?

70
00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:37.699
Yeah, bird brain.

71
00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:40.699
He's only got one daughter and it's Selena.

72
00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:48.520
What kind of daughter are you?

73
00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.520
Done with yourself.

74
00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.520
I can't believe it.

75
00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.039
You know what you've done to both your mother and me too?

76
00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:58.360
You need to remember where you came from.

77
00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.000
Your parents are not billionaires.

78
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.639
We are a security guard and a maid.

79
00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:05.639
Don't you forget that.

80
00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:06.669
Oh my god.

81
00:03:06.669 --> 00:03:08.669
Her father is a security guard.

82
00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:11.669
I had a feeling she was an imposter.

83
00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:12.669
Disgusting.

84
00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:14.669
You shameless swimbler.

85
00:03:14.669 --> 00:03:19.879
You actually thought that you could get away with pretending to be an heiress.

86
00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:22.039
I knew at the moment I met you.

87
00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:24.240
You had this broke girl loser energy to you.

88
00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.360
I've been wasting our time with her.

89
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.189
Selena.

90
00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:33.240
I haven't been thinking to say how sorry I am.

91
00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.240
Yeah, Selena.

92
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.800
We actually really liked you all this time.

93
00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.240
It was actually a race that was forcing us to mean to you.

94
00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.240
Exactly.

95
00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.240
It's all versus fault.

96
00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.969
She manipulated us.

97
00:03:43.969 --> 00:03:44.969
We're really sorry.

98
00:03:44.969 --> 00:03:45.969
You believe us right?

99
00:03:45.969 --> 00:03:46.969
You know, I absolutely love working for you.

100
00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:47.969
Yeah.

101
00:03:47.969 --> 00:04:06.639
Under one condition, you all need right now.

102
00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:10.319
Oh, and one more thing.

103
00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:12.590
You're all fired.

104
00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.090
Oh, and one more thing.

105
00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.089
You're all fired.

106
00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:17.089
No, please.

107
00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:19.449
You can't do that.

108
00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:20.449
What?

109
00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:21.649
No, please Nick, don't fire us.

110
00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:23.490
You can fire them, but not me.

111
00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.500
I'm much more important to the company.

112
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.379
No, you deserve much worse than that.

113
00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:35.259
From the second you met me, you treated me like trash, all because you thought I was

114
00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:36.259
poor.

115
00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:41.199
That's no way to treat anyone at work, not even in the trade.

116
00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:42.199
Security?

117
00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:44.439
Let's get these ladies out of here.

118
00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:45.660
Come on.

119
00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:46.660
Let's go.

120
00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:47.660
Let's go.

121
00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:48.660
Let's go.

122
00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:54.329
Yeah.

123
00:04:54.329 --> 00:04:55.329
Yeah.

124
00:04:55.329 --> 00:04:56.329
Yeah.

125
00:04:56.329 --> 00:04:57.329
Mr. Branson, this is all my fault.

126
00:04:57.329 --> 00:04:58.329
I'm very sorry.

127
00:04:58.329 --> 00:04:59.329
How so?

128
00:04:59.769 --> 00:05:03.480
I should not have allowed her into this event.

129
00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.240
Please don't fire me.

130
00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.399
Too late.

131
00:05:06.399 --> 00:05:07.399
You fired.

132
00:05:07.399 --> 00:05:08.399
No, wait.

133
00:05:08.399 --> 00:05:14.759
What you did was wrong, but I'm not going to fire you for that.

134
00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:21.199
However, you are being demoted, and you will no longer serve as head of my security.

135
00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:22.199
Thank you, Mr. Branson.

136
00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:28.189
Hey, where are you going?

137
00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:29.189
I'm leaving.

138
00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:32.040
You'll never have to see me again.

139
00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.610
No.

140
00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:36.120
No what?

141
00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.120
No.

142
00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.120
That's not enough.

143
00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.319
Like?

144
00:05:39.319 --> 00:05:41.560
Right away, sir.

145
00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:42.560
No.

146
00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:43.560
You come and wheeze me by them.

147
00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.560
No.

148
00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:45.560
Wait.

149
00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:50.470
Where are you taking me?

150
00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:57.519
Oh, in the door.

151
00:05:57.519 --> 00:06:00.019
George, I want to sincerely apologize.

152
00:06:00.019 --> 00:06:01.500
It was never.

153
00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:05.819
My intention to actually cancel the engagement with Selena is a case of mistaken identities.

154
00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:07.019
All right.

155
00:06:07.019 --> 00:06:08.019
But know this.

156
00:06:08.019 --> 00:06:13.019
If you ever mistreat my daughter's name again in the future, it won't be pretty.

157
00:06:13.019 --> 00:06:14.819
Yes, sir.

158
00:06:14.819 --> 00:06:19.209
What?

159
00:06:19.209 --> 00:06:23.839
I knew it was you.

160
00:06:23.839 --> 00:06:25.560
You knew I was a Murphy?

161
00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:26.720
No, at the airport.

162
00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:34.769
The men's bathroom.

163
00:06:34.769 --> 00:06:36.930
You're still on about that?

164
00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:38.509
Sorry, pal.

165
00:06:38.509 --> 00:06:42.089
I have no idea what you're talking about.

166
00:06:42.089 --> 00:06:43.089
Pretty sure it was you.

167
00:06:43.089 --> 00:06:45.819
I guess you'll never know.

168
00:06:45.819 --> 00:06:50.230
I guess there's only one way to find out.

169
00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:51.230
And how's that?

170
00:06:51.230 --> 00:07:13.879
See, I knew it had worked out.

171
00:07:13.879 --> 00:07:14.879
My contract is up today.

172
00:07:14.879 --> 00:07:17.680
What do you mean?

173
00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.720
Remember my three-month-long contract with my father?

174
00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:23.339
Right.

175
00:07:23.339 --> 00:07:24.339
So what does that mean?

176
00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:28.879
So that today is my last day here.

177
00:07:28.879 --> 00:07:30.430
Really?

178
00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:32.040
Yep.

179
00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:33.040
You're a senior designer.

180
00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:34.449
We need you.

181
00:07:34.449 --> 00:07:36.120
I know.

182
00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:40.720
That's why I'm starting my own designer company.

183
00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:51.480
You're happy about that.

184
00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:58.250
But are we still on for our wedding next month?

185
00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:00.209
I don't know.

186
00:08:00.209 --> 00:08:03.370
I guess my schedule of CEO is going to be pretty busy.

187
00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:06.560
Well, I guess I should reconsider letting you go.
