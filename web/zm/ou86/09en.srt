1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Hey, Max.

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:02,200
Hey.

3
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:08,230
I heard you killed a man in the manner for a girl.

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:09,529
I heard.

5
00:00:10,359 --> 00:00:11,660
You shouldn't mind your business.

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,800
It seems like you got out of control.

7
00:00:15,099 --> 00:00:16,600
I'm just worried about you.

8
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:19,359
What's so special about the girl?

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:20,760
You seem jealous.

10
00:00:21,489 --> 00:00:23,589
I know you still care about Nina.

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,859
I'm just wondering what kind of girl could take her place.

12
00:00:29,059 --> 00:00:30,559
You're hoping to be that girl.

13
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:35,289
Nina is my best friend.

14
00:00:35,789 --> 00:00:37,390
I couldn't do that to her.

15
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:46,240
I was just hoping that I could have a special little place in your sad heart.

16
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:49,240
You know the Luther King.

17
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,340
I'm not an excercer.

18
00:00:52,549 --> 00:00:53,750
I'm sorry, Scarlet.

19
00:00:54,829 --> 00:00:58,829
With your condition, I'm afraid it's impossible for you to be our child.
