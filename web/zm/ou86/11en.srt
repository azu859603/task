1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:05,259
He must be sick of his little, uh, little caterpillar, right?

2
00:00:05,259 --> 00:00:07,259
Mine's way more rather than his.

3
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:10,259
And I can give you anything you want.

4
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:13,839
Never in a million years.

5
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:14,839
Bitch.

6
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:16,839
Stop it! Let's go on me!

7
00:00:16,839 --> 00:00:18,839
Go!

8
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:26,699
Finally, someone made you a dickwerk, huh?

9
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:29,019
Get out.

10
00:00:29,019 --> 00:00:31,019
For a skin you would feed you to the dogs.

11
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:34,409
You always think of me as the bastard.

12
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:43,520
This bastard's gonna get coronated one day, mate.

13
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,850
Mm.

14
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:57,170
Yes.

15
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:58,170
Is that how you do housekeeping?

16
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:00,170
Groveling under another man's face.

17
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:01,969
What the hell do you want?

18
00:01:01,969 --> 00:01:04,969
I want you to pay for everything you did so well.

19
00:01:04,969 --> 00:01:05,969
I know what he told you.

20
00:01:05,969 --> 00:01:07,969
I'm not the one who killed your sister.

21
00:01:07,969 --> 00:01:08,969
Fire!

22
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:10,670
My gosh, don't move.

23
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:13,269
Just let me go.

24
00:01:13,269 --> 00:01:14,719
I promise.

25
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:16,849
I'll never show up again.

26
00:01:16,849 --> 00:01:20,319
But you die slowly, my voice.

27
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:27,090
Is that really what you want?

28
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:31,599
Your brother said you've been impotent for the last three years.

29
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:33,599
You don't seem to have a problem getting hard for me.

30
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:34,599
Wake up!

31
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:42,980
Wherever I am, if I'm in hell, you'll come looking for me.

32
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:53,019
Who do you think you'll be free?

33
00:01:53,019 --> 00:01:54,019
You don't.

34
00:01:54,019 --> 00:02:16,969
Skipped with me.

35
00:02:16,969 --> 00:02:21,729
That explains why you're in such a horrible state.

36
00:02:21,729 --> 00:02:22,729
What do you mean?

37
00:02:22,729 --> 00:02:25,729
Max is not the gentleman we used to know.

38
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:27,729
He's a monster now.

39
00:02:27,729 --> 00:02:30,139
I saw him execute a traitor.

40
00:02:30,139 --> 00:02:32,139
He was so bloody.

41
00:02:32,139 --> 00:02:33,139
So horrible.

42
00:02:33,139 --> 00:02:38,409
I'm your best friend.

43
00:02:38,409 --> 00:02:40,409
I will help you.

44
00:02:40,409 --> 00:02:50,020
Yes.

45
00:02:50,020 --> 00:03:00,069
Where is he?

46
00:03:00,069 --> 00:03:01,069
Where are we going?

47
00:03:01,069 --> 00:03:02,069
I know a place.

48
00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:04,069
Max will never find you there.

49
00:03:04,069 --> 00:03:05,139
Trust me.

50
00:03:05,139 --> 00:03:18,419
Where are we?

51
00:03:18,419 --> 00:03:20,419
I'll come to dark with.

52
00:03:20,419 --> 00:03:28,789
You are going to like it.

53
00:03:28,789 --> 00:03:29,789
She's all yours.

54
00:03:29,789 --> 00:03:30,789
Take good care of her.

55
00:03:30,789 --> 00:03:33,789
Rest assured, once inside my dungeon, nobody gets out alive.

56
00:03:33,789 --> 00:03:36,789
What if Mr. Luther finds out she's not in the right place?

57
00:03:36,789 --> 00:03:37,789
Trust me.

58
00:03:37,789 --> 00:03:45,900
That will never happen.

59
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,900
Remember this place?

60
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,900
I know you miss it.

61
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,379
Welcome home, sweetie.

62
00:03:53,379 --> 00:04:01,009
You're the one who brought me here?

63
00:04:01,009 --> 00:04:04,009
You think I would do this without Max's consent?

64
00:04:04,009 --> 00:04:06,009
Scarlett, why are you doing this?

65
00:04:06,009 --> 00:04:07,009
I thought we were friends.

66
00:04:07,009 --> 00:04:09,009
Who am I to be your best friend?

67
00:04:09,009 --> 00:04:13,009
For crying out loud, you've got good looks and a decent upbringing.

68
00:04:13,009 --> 00:04:15,009
You don't deserve the Luther family.

69
00:04:15,009 --> 00:04:16,009
I do.

70
00:04:16,009 --> 00:04:20,009
I was wrong to think that locking you up would make Max forget about you.

71
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:23,009
But now, it looks like I'll just have to kill you.

72
00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:26,699
Do your job.

73
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:34,170
DTX.

74
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:35,420
Remember?

75
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:40,269
I'll kill you if you dare touch me.

76
00:04:40,269 --> 00:04:42,819
Well, I remember.

77
00:04:42,819 --> 00:04:47,040
You said the same thing the first time I gave it.

78
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:52,040
But as soon as it answers your body, you ask for more.

79
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,040
No.

80
00:04:53,040 --> 00:05:07,579
The little girl that drives me crazy.

81
00:05:07,579 --> 00:05:11,430
Nina.

82
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:19,920
I'm sorry.

83
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,100
No.

84
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,100
Look, it's me.

85
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,519
Max.

86
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:25,519
Why don't you touch me?

87
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:27,519
Because you make me sick.

88
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:29,480
You have to calm down.

89
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:36,920
Why don't you touch me?

90
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,139
Because you make me sick.

91
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:41,819
You need to calm down.

92
00:05:41,819 --> 00:06:02,949
Max, what have you done?

93
00:06:02,949 --> 00:06:03,949
Get out.

94
00:06:03,949 --> 00:06:05,949
Stop torturing her.

95
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:06,949
Who are you?

96
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:09,949
Max, I don't even know you anymore.

97
00:06:09,949 --> 00:06:19,819
You're still weak.

98
00:06:19,819 --> 00:06:22,870
You want now.

99
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:24,899
Drug me and sell me like a slave again?

100
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:27,610
But you get from this.

101
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:29,379
Are you happy now?

102
00:06:29,379 --> 00:06:31,379
I've become a whore to everyone.

103
00:06:31,379 --> 00:06:32,379
Shut up!

104
00:06:32,379 --> 00:06:35,379
You deserve wars for what you did to my sister.

105
00:06:35,379 --> 00:06:38,339
You want me to be a little slut?

106
00:06:38,339 --> 00:06:43,259
It's just a tip of the ice.

107
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:49,699
You want to see more?

108
00:06:49,699 --> 00:06:55,540
Want to see more?

109
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,540
Mustful and unsatisfied.

110
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,540
I said stop.

111
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:02,300
My life is ruined.

112
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,300
All I want is to get away from you.

113
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,300
Max.

114
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,970
Take her to the secret chain.

115
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:10,000
Don't let her out.

116
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,379
I was Nina.

117
00:07:16,379 --> 00:07:19,920
She's been on a hunger strike for days.

118
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,180
Make her steak and mushrooms.

119
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,430
It'll cheer her up.

120
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:34,939
You'll have to eat.

121
00:07:34,939 --> 00:07:38,149
One can not squeeze me.

122
00:07:38,149 --> 00:07:40,250
It depends on my master's mood.

123
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:45,129
You're not as cool as it is.

124
00:07:45,129 --> 00:07:47,899
You better eat.

125
00:07:47,899 --> 00:07:50,899
You can't fight against him without strength.

126
00:07:50,899 --> 00:07:58,279
Nina has never been to the state penitentiary.

127
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:00,279
What did you find out about Nina?

128
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:03,279
Ms. Morgan was imprisoned this whole time.

129
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:05,379
And she got addicted to drugster.

130
00:08:05,379 --> 00:08:07,379
You killed Mr. Black.

131
00:08:07,379 --> 00:08:09,379
You was my best deal and my best cash cow.

132
00:08:09,379 --> 00:08:10,379
How could you do that?

133
00:08:10,379 --> 00:08:12,139
DTX?

134
00:08:12,139 --> 00:08:14,139
That's what that is, right?

135
00:08:14,139 --> 00:08:16,500
Our family doesn't do drugs.

136
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:20,620
According to Father Swell, I'm in control of the underground business.

137
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,620
Just stay off my turf.

138
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:25,620
It's a mercy that I even let you be part of the family business.

139
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,620
It's Nina Morgan, isn't it?

140
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:28,620
You do everything for now.

141
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,620
She's a nobody.

142
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:32,330
I don't have to do anything for her.

143
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:34,330
And why'd you luck away in your house?

144
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:35,419
She means nothing.

145
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:37,419
I told you I don't give a shit about that.

146
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:40,480
I can see right through you.

147
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,740
So much I can do to her.

148
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:42,740
To you.

149
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:43,740
She'll be.

150
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,600
She'll be.

151
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:55,950
Stop drinking.

152
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:59,750
Stop hurting yourself for that selfish woman.

153
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,750
I'm not doing it for her.

154
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,820
I keep her around so I can torture her.

155
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:09,940
Max, I'm the only one who truly cares for you.

156
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:16,059
I know I can't have a child, but I'll figure it out.

157
00:09:16,059 --> 00:09:18,059
I'll do anything I can.

158
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:19,059
A child?

159
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,730
Yes.

160
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:21,730
Our child.

161
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:23,730
A forever bond.

162
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,730
A testament for our love.

163
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:33,710
What's going on?

164
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:46,360
Jesus.

165
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,700
I can't stand it anymore.

166
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:52,049
You've come clean once.

167
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:54,049
You can do it again.

168
00:09:54,049 --> 00:09:55,110
Guys are double flea-

169
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:58,580
It's all right.

170
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,580
I'm here.

171
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,710
You can get over this.

172
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:12,919
What is going on?

173
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:13,919
It's an author.

174
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:14,919
Hey, stop.

175
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:20,210
You betray me.

176
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:22,070
Again.

177
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:28,580
How long has this been going on here?

178
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,580
My nose.

179
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,580
It's not like that.

180
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:35,590
He was just trying to help me get off the drug.

181
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:36,590
Please.

182
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:37,590
By hugging you?

183
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:38,590
It's on my phone.

184
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:39,720
It's on my phone.

185
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,620
You can go.

186
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:42,620
I'll do anything.

187
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,620
No, you're still weak, Mr. Luther.

188
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,620
Please.

189
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,620
Don't blame Ms. Morgan.

190
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,620
I will take any punishment.

191
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,539
Touch you.

192
00:10:51,539 --> 00:10:54,669
Let's see what you do for your love when you know.

193
00:10:54,669 --> 00:11:06,860
I wouldn't marry you before because you couldn't see.

194
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:09,460
Now I've solved our problem.

195
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,659
She can have our baby.

196
00:11:11,659 --> 00:11:13,659
And you can become Mrs. Luther.

197
00:11:13,659 --> 00:11:14,659
No.

198
00:11:14,659 --> 00:11:15,659
I'm not doing that.

199
00:11:15,659 --> 00:11:16,659
You can't do that to me.

200
00:11:16,659 --> 00:11:21,539
You are in no position to bargain.

201
00:11:21,539 --> 00:11:22,539
Have my baby.

202
00:11:22,539 --> 00:11:25,269
Or I'll kill Lance.

203
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:28,269
I care about him but I'm not having your child.

204
00:11:28,269 --> 00:11:29,269
Just so you know.

205
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:32,100
I have your father too.

206
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,100
What did you do to him?

207
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,769
Nothing good.

208
00:11:36,769 --> 00:11:39,820
But I can't promise that last.

209
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,720
If I have this child,

210
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,669
will you finally set me free and my father?

211
00:11:47,669 --> 00:11:49,669
If you have this child,

212
00:11:49,669 --> 00:11:52,700
you and your father will be free of the Luther family.

213
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:55,950
What about Lance?

214
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:57,659
Sure.

215
00:11:57,659 --> 00:11:58,690
Him too.

216
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:06,379
I'll do it.

217
00:12:06,379 --> 00:12:09,570
But once that child is born,

218
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:12,570
you will never see me again.

219
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:13,730
You have my word.

220
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:20,529
Did Mrs. Luther hurt you again?

221
00:12:20,529 --> 00:12:21,529
I'm fine.

222
00:12:21,529 --> 00:12:23,940
I'm fine.

223
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,940
I'm sorry to have dragged you into the water with me.

224
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:26,940
It's okay.

225
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:29,190
I can take this.

226
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:45,759
Cinderella without her glass slippers.

227
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:48,759
Anciously waiting for her prince.

228
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:49,759
Hmm?

229
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:54,419
I still remember the first time I met you.

230
00:12:54,419 --> 00:12:56,580
Dressed like Cinderella.

231
00:12:56,580 --> 00:13:00,159
Lighting up the whole school dance ball.

232
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:02,899
I could tell.

233
00:13:02,899 --> 00:13:03,899
It's as ugly as fun.

234
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:04,899
Stop!

235
00:13:04,899 --> 00:13:05,899
Nina.

236
00:13:05,899 --> 00:13:07,759
It's fine.

237
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:08,759
Don't worry.

238
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:11,950
I shouldn't have helped you that night.

239
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:14,370
Now I'm Cinderella.

240
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:16,909
You're the maid.

241
00:13:16,909 --> 00:13:19,330
Clean up the mess.

242
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:27,460
What are you doing?

243
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,649
What are you doing?

244
00:13:29,649 --> 00:13:31,710
I can explain.

245
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:34,960
Why didn't you fight back?

246
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,960
How?

247
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,960
This is the Luther household.

248
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,960
Who am I to defy Mrs. Luther?

249
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,440
Mrs. Luther, huh?

250
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:54,330
How long has this been going on?

251
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:58,019
Almost a week.

252
00:13:58,019 --> 00:13:59,019
Are you pregnant?

253
00:13:59,019 --> 00:14:06,620
Oh, I can't have his child.

254
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:13,779
Let me help you.

255
00:14:13,779 --> 00:14:16,779
You need to get a test to see if you really are pregnant.

256
00:14:16,779 --> 00:14:17,779
I don't need your help, okay?

257
00:14:17,779 --> 00:14:21,889
You know what happens when you do?

258
00:14:21,889 --> 00:14:24,879
I don't care.

259
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:28,970
I'm going to catch you out of this hellhole.

260
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:32,970
But before I do, you must not let Mr. Luther know anything about this.

261
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:41,539
Why can't you get hard?

262
00:14:41,539 --> 00:14:46,000
Am I not hot enough?

263
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Did I do something wrong, Maxie?

264
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,440
I promise I can do better.

265
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:57,750
The only problem is you're not her.

266
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:09,539
But what is wrong with you?

267
00:15:09,539 --> 00:15:11,539
You need to go to the doctor.

268
00:15:11,539 --> 00:15:13,539
Like you care.

269
00:15:13,539 --> 00:15:15,539
You look like you're pregnant.

270
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:25,860
Do something.

271
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:35,159
I'll get you a towel.

272
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:36,159
What is this?

273
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:42,450
This is an heirloom that has been handed down in the Luther family.

274
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:44,899
It's beautiful.

275
00:15:44,899 --> 00:15:57,659
One day, we're belonging to our child.

276
00:15:57,659 --> 00:15:58,659
What's in your hand?

277
00:15:58,659 --> 00:16:02,299
You better be able to conceive in your condition.

278
00:16:02,299 --> 00:16:03,299
I can't.

279
00:16:03,299 --> 00:16:05,299
Every second I spend with you in Scarlet is disgusting.

280
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:15,620
What do you want?

281
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:18,620
First of all, I can't be confined to this house.

282
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,620
I need fresh air.

283
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:23,620
You can go for a walk in the yard once a day for one hour.

284
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:27,299
Second, I gotta have my own room.

285
00:16:27,299 --> 00:16:29,299
I need good rest.

286
00:16:29,299 --> 00:16:34,929
Lance will see to it that you are not disturbed while you're resting.

287
00:16:34,929 --> 00:16:39,279
Last but not least, I want Scarlet to be my servant.

288
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:40,279
And take care of me.

289
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:41,279
What makes you think I would agree to?

290
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,279
I name my requests.

291
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:44,279
You make the decision.

292
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:50,179
I see what you're playing at.

293
00:16:50,179 --> 00:16:54,379
Pregnant.

294
00:16:54,379 --> 00:16:56,929
Maxie's child.

295
00:16:56,929 --> 00:16:57,929
Are you gonna keep it?

296
00:16:57,929 --> 00:17:01,950
Sure, it's my baby, but you can't know about it.

297
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:03,950
I need to get out of here.

298
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:04,950
He's dangerous.

299
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:05,950
Come with me.

300
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:07,109
We can go to Texas.

301
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:09,109
I have a house there.

302
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:11,109
I love your baby like it's my only.

303
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:16,119
I don't like this.

304
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,119
Get me something else.

305
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,119
How dare you?

306
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:20,119
Do what she says.

307
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:25,190
Clean this mess up.

308
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:26,190
No way.

309
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:31,259
I've done everything you've asked.

310
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:33,259
When can we start to plan out the surrogacy?

311
00:17:33,259 --> 00:17:35,869
I need to see my dad first.

312
00:17:35,869 --> 00:17:37,900
Don't push it.

313
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,900
I need to make sure he's safe.

314
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,059
Fine.

315
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:43,059
I'll take you to my cocktail party tonight.

316
00:17:43,059 --> 00:17:44,420
Your dad will be there.

317
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:48,210
You like this, don't you?

318
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:50,210
Do you really like this shit?

319
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:51,210
Yeah.

320
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:53,210
You can be happy now.

321
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:55,210
But don't get carried away.

322
00:17:55,210 --> 00:18:04,099
Once this baby is born, you'll be ditched.

323
00:18:04,099 --> 00:18:05,099
Put this on for me.

324
00:18:05,099 --> 00:18:06,099
Made.

325
00:18:06,099 --> 00:18:29,930
Excuse me?

326
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:38,970
You always did look stunning in the way.

327
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:39,970
Do that again.

328
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:46,390
Never see your father again.

329
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:47,390
What am I?

330
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:48,390
You're Barbie doll?

331
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:49,490
It's perfect.

332
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:54,329
Let's go.

333
00:18:54,329 --> 00:18:56,329
It's party time.

334
00:18:56,329 --> 00:18:57,329
You're staying here.

335
00:18:57,329 --> 00:19:00,740
But I'm Mrs. Luther.

336
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:05,750
Not yet, you're not.

337
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,750
Cinderella goes to the ball.

338
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,750
Gus Gus stays home.
