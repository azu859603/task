1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,870
Oh my god, look, it's Max Luther.

2
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:08,869
Oh my god, I hope that's not Mrs. Luther.

3
00:00:08,869 --> 00:00:10,869
My heart will bleed.

4
00:00:10,869 --> 00:00:13,640
Look at their faces.

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,309
I can bring you up.

6
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:18,309
But I can also bring you down.

7
00:00:23,309 --> 00:00:27,760
Tomorrow at the cocktail party, I'll get Mr. Luther drunk.

8
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:35,060
Then I'll disable the House of Securities instead.

9
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:38,630
You take the chance to get out of the house.

10
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:43,210
Once you're out, I'll pick you up at the bus station.

11
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:47,899
Once we're in Texas, we'll be free.

12
00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:50,700
I need to warn my dad first.

13
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,700
I need to tell him to escape.

14
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:56,380
Okay, don't worry. We're gonna be okay.
