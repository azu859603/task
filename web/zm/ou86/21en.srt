1
00:00:01,419 --> 00:00:03,419
Where are you going?

2
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:05,490
Just to crop some air.

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:07,740
I'm coming with you.

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:12,019
May I have my ball back?

5
00:00:12,019 --> 00:00:14,019
Thanks. Are you two married?

6
00:00:14,019 --> 00:00:15,019
What makes you say that?

7
00:00:15,019 --> 00:00:21,449
You two look perfect for each other.

8
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:26,410
If the baby is mine, you will be Mrs. Luther.

9
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:28,410
And it will take over the family business.

10
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:33,369
All I want is to be with Lance.

11
00:00:33,369 --> 00:00:36,520
Bar away from you.

12
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:50,020
My child will not be raised as a bastard.

13
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:52,020
He seems to like business stones.
