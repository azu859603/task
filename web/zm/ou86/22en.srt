1
00:00:02,379 --> 00:00:05,080
How dare you, a last lady like that?

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:06,379
How could you really like you?

3
00:00:06,379 --> 00:00:07,379
Should we appreciate it?

4
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:09,179
No, wasted on that.

5
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:10,880
I have no idea what you're talking about.

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,380
You deserve nothing but the best in my opinion.

7
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,379
So let me be who served your life.

8
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:17,879
Let go of me!

9
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:20,379
I know what you have to do.

10
00:00:20,379 --> 00:00:21,879
Are you out of your mind?

11
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:23,879
I know all the secrets you've done, Scott.

12
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:25,879
Don't stop.

13
00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:28,460
Stop.

14
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:30,219
Stop!

15
00:00:30,219 --> 00:00:31,440
Hey!

16
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,439
Stop it!

17
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:33,439
Lily!

18
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:34,439
What are you doing?

19
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:35,439
Let her go.

20
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:38,619
What are you doing?

21
00:00:38,619 --> 00:00:50,390
The universe trembles and shakes.

22
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:52,390
The currents of history erode our world.

23
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:54,390
It's a late vanish.

24
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,710
I hate you.

25
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:58,420
I hate you.
