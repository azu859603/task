00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.779
Nina. Nina. Where are we going?

2
00:00:02.779 --> 00:00:04.780
It's my only chance to escape now.

3
00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:05.980
You should stay.

4
00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.380
I'm doing this for the baby.

5
00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.439
A monster like him won't make a good father.

6
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:19.309
It's true. It's Maxis.

7
00:00:19.309 --> 00:00:20.510
Don't worry.

8
00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.109
Not everyone can be forever fortunate by the gutters of luck.

9
00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:26.109
Stop babbling like an idiot.

10
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.500
If this baby is born,

11
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.100
you won't get any of the Luther family's fortune.

12
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.100
Don't worry. It won't.

13
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.909
Max. Max.

14
00:00:38.909 --> 00:00:43.439
You're not?

15
00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:45.439
Nina has escaped.
