1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,280
It was you.

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:03,779
It was when he pulled the trigger, wasn't he?

3
00:00:03,779 --> 00:00:08,019
Death is a... so final.

4
00:00:08,019 --> 00:00:10,619
Where's life is full of possibilities?

5
00:00:10,619 --> 00:00:14,380
If I were you, I'd love your life to make my spend.

6
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:22,679
The door looks so gloomy.

7
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:24,239
You're free now.

8
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:29,390
I said someone will be monitoring you all the time.

9
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:38,240
Sartre once said, hell is other people.

10
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,679
Since I can't escape from hell,

11
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:43,259
I might as well embrace it.
