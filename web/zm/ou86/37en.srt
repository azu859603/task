1
00:00:01,139 --> 00:00:08,140
This opportunity, new little brothers, the worst lodges, and more you found will hold a press conference entirely due to it.

2
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:10,169
Put these on.

3
00:00:10,169 --> 00:00:12,169
You're going to the press conference with me.

4
00:00:12,169 --> 00:00:13,169
It's none of my business.

5
00:00:13,169 --> 00:00:15,169
You are going to go.

6
00:00:15,169 --> 00:00:17,170
I asked Mrs. Luther.

7
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:19,359
So this is how you make it up to me.

8
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,359
My freedom and my child.

9
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:24,359
For the title of Mrs. Luther?

10
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:27,000
Great bargain.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,350
You killed my sister.

12
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:30,350
Neither of us are innocent.

13
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:34,350
Have you ever considered just for a moment that I never did it?

14
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:46,850
I prepared your favor.

15
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:48,740
What anywhere?

16
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:51,740
Can we stop pretending like I wouldn't be here?

17
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:55,409
Whatever. You're Mrs. Luther now.
