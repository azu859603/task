00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.109
Think you can get rid of me?

2
00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:05.830
You betrayed me. I want nothing to do with you.

3
00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:11.150
Filthy couple, you think I'm someone you can mess with, huh?

4
00:00:12.109 --> 00:00:14.429
Listen up, everyone.

5
00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.390
This is Nina Morgan, and she'll do anything for the right price.

6
00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:20.910
She is a Morgan?

7
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:29.420
Yep, and I'm Victor Morgan, her father, and I know about everything she did.

8
00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:39.969
From the drugs, to the secret Luther baby, to the abortion, she's the jinx that brought the great more family down.

9
00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:50.030
Now you're Horton, too. You must carry on our legacy.

10
00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:56.030
I remember Nina Morgan. She went to prison for murder. The allegations against Ms. Morgan are false.

11
00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.640
She's a good person.

12
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.149
While Victor Morgan is nothing more than a lie.
