00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.240
Don't catch a cold.

2
00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:02.200
Cut your show.

3
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.440
You know, it was an accident.

4
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.240
Isn't that what you wanted?

5
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.400
To embarrass me and the Morgan family through Victor.

6
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.539
I have a conference call.

7
00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:12.740
Stay here.

8
00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.980
Mr. Luther, you're under arrest for the possession of drugs.

9
00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.820
Mr. Luther, you found this in your car.

10
00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.760
Care to explain?

11
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:32.579
I'd like to speak to my lawyer.

12
00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:33.939
You're free.

13
00:00:33.939 --> 00:00:39.659
Listen to me, my sister died because of your business.

14
00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:40.780
I know your family.

15
00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.780
I know everything that they do.

16
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:49.109
See you soon.

17
00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:51.509
Just receive a call from this morning.

18
00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:54.030
The one who planned the drugs in your car.

19
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.179
You knew you didn't get the drugs in the room.

20
00:00:57.179 --> 00:00:58.340
Someone else is behind this.
