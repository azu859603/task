1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:04,509
Dad, what are you doing?

2
00:00:04,509 --> 00:00:06,509
I told you I'd come for you.

3
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:10,550
So, Pico!

4
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:13,550
I brought my daughter here, and the money is in the case.

5
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:15,550
Man, you can do whatever you want to do.

6
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:17,550
All right, I need to check it first.

7
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:23,550
The money you promised. Where is it?

8
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:25,550
To never receive anything, Pico.

9
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:27,260
She tricked me.

10
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:29,320
It's now out of my control.

11
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,320
If you want money, she's got plenty.

12
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,320
She's Mrs. Luther.

13
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,539
Max Luther.

14
00:00:35,539 --> 00:00:37,539
You idiot, why are you saving?

15
00:00:37,539 --> 00:00:39,539
You put us both in so much danger. You have no idea.

16
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:41,539
Where are you going?
