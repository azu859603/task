1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:02,049
Nina. You okay?

2
00:00:02,049 --> 00:00:03,049
I'm fine.

3
00:00:03,049 --> 00:00:04,719
Get this off.

4
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:05,719
Stop!

5
00:00:05,719 --> 00:00:07,910
Bringing fake money to a kidnapper.

6
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:10,039
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

7
00:00:10,039 --> 00:00:12,039
What do you do to my dad?

8
00:00:12,039 --> 00:00:14,039
Why do you still care about that jerk?

9
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:16,039
After everything he's done to you.

10
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:17,039
Stop being such a saint.

11
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,039
Stop pretending that you care.

12
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:20,039
Okay?

13
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:22,039
Just leave us alone.

14
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:23,039
Would you regret it?

15
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,190
We're part of the Luther family.

16
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:28,190
How dare you lock us up like this?

17
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:29,190
Don't worry.

18
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:31,190
I just want to have a discussion.

19
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:33,420
What's better to discuss?

20
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,579
You make all the decisions.

21
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:38,700
I turn a blind eye to all your underdoings with Donnie.

22
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,700
That doesn't mean I'm somebody to be mess with.

23
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,700
You have no right to tell us what to do.

24
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:51,390
Now.

25
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,939
Does anybody else have anything to say?

26
00:00:53,939 --> 00:00:55,939
Now is the time.
