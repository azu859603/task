1
00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.879
What the hell is this?

2
00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.879
That is my personal property.

3
00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:07.879
And I want it back!

4
00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:08.880
Shut your mouth.

5
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.039
You can't have it back.

6
00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:14.669
Many thanks from Mr. Loop.

7
00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:17.670
And the illegal deeds in his family will be taken care of soon.

8
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:28.149
What a fancy car.

9
00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:32.579
Shut up that bitch.

10
00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:33.579
Set me up with those cops.

11
00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:35.579
Got me body searched.

12
00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.549
Here's a million.

13
00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:44.549
Minus a hundred thousand to bail you out.

14
00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:48.310
Now give me that recorder.

15
00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:52.329
I'm waiting.

16
00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:56.179
What a?

17
00:00:56.179 --> 00:01:05.569
Get out of my car.

18
00:01:05.569 --> 00:01:07.569
You are so dead!

19
00:01:07.569 --> 00:01:14.159
I never would have escaped those bullies without Lily's help.

20
00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.420
You mean the devil, so that's how you framed her death on Nina.

21
00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.420
So I've been wrong about Nina this whole time.

22
00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.989
Check and see how Lily died.

23
00:01:22.989 --> 00:01:27.189
Yeah.

24
00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:31.269
Have you made your decision?

25
00:01:31.269 --> 00:01:32.269
Whoa.

26
00:01:32.269 --> 00:01:34.519
Sure hurry.

27
00:01:34.519 --> 00:01:39.500
Aren't you afraid of the truth?

28
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.049
This card has no limit or password.

29
00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.849
Take it and never come back.

30
00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:46.849
Don't you want the recorder?

31
00:01:46.849 --> 00:01:48.849
I'll find out the truth myself.

32
00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:51.299
I just want you to stay away from me now.

33
00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.900
You don't need to investigate.

34
00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.120
Nina's the one who killed Lily.

35
00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.629
Why do you treat your daughter this way?

36
00:02:01.629 --> 00:02:04.299
I don't need a purse.

37
00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:07.299
She's just someone I use to get rich.

38
00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:10.139
Take your money.

39
00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:11.840
And leave.

40
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:12.840
With this baby.

41
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:30.460
Shitface.

42
00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:31.460
Son of a bitch.

43
00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.819
I found out something.

44
00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.400
Wait for me in my office.

45
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.400
Max Luther.

46
00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.539
Come on, get him there.

47
00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:44.539
Let's go.

48
00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:45.539
Keep him stable.

49
00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:46.539
What happened?

50
00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:48.539
Let's salute the gas shop.

51
00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:49.949
The corporation.

52
00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:52.039
Hello.

53
00:02:52.039 --> 00:03:19.449
What happened to my father?

54
00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:20.449
My father died.

55
00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:22.449
I'll roll it to the head.

56
00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:23.449
Severe brain damage.

57
00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:25.449
And we found this.

58
00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:33.180
So I've been wrong about Nina the whole time.

59
00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.500
I didn't kill Lily.

60
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.500
I would never hurt your sister.

61
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.500
I hope you die in hell.

62
00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.610
Where are I going?

63
00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:43.610
I just have to see Nina.

64
00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.120
That's surgery.

65
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.120
You don't want to run like this.

66
00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.120
I've done something horrible.

67
00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.120
I have to see her.

68
00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.120
Nina.

69
00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.120
Why did you kill my father?

70
00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.120
What do you mean?

71
00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.120
Victor's dead?

72
00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.120
Stop pretending you're murderer.

73
00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.120
Nina, there must be a mistake.

74
00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.120
Max just got shot.

75
00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.120
I don't know what you're talking about, but it has nothing to do with me.

76
00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.120
Then why was my dad found holding your family's card when he was dead?

77
00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.750
I tried to escape, but I just couldn't run away.

78
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.479
I thought about dying.

79
00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:16.480
But you robbed me of that comfort too.

80
00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.980
Now I know what has to be done to end this fucking nightmare.

81
00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:33.420
I've always wanted for you.

82
00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:48.209
I call the police.

83
00:04:48.209 --> 00:04:50.209
They all catch Nina.

84
00:04:50.209 --> 00:04:51.209
Don't.

85
00:04:51.209 --> 00:04:53.420
I don't hurt her for too long.

86
00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:56.000
The truth is out now.

87
00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.019
It's time to let her go.

88
00:04:58.019 --> 00:05:02.069
Happiness without me.

89
00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:07.139
I killed someone.

90
00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:09.870
I want to turn myself in.

91
00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.819
You promised me you would take her of Nina.

92
00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:15.819
You chose your own life over hers.

93
00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:18.819
And now you come here to judge me.

94
00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:24.720
You've always been one of my most loyal men, so I will give you a choice.

95
00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:35.699
You can either leave town forever and forget about Nina, or you die.

96
00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:36.699
Let go of me!

97
00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:42.000
So why'd you bring me back?

98
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:50.839
For Nina.

99
00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:53.970
I just got off the phone with the Luther family.

100
00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:54.970
No one has died.

101
00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:59.420
It's impossible, but I stabbed him right in the chest.

102
00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:09.899
I think you're mistaken Miss Morgan.

103
00:06:09.899 --> 00:06:14.350
So when Max is letting me go, or is he just messing with me again?

104
00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:24.100
Hello Nina.

105
00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:25.100
You were dead.

106
00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:28.100
Max, you faked my death and sent me to a asylum.

107
00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.100
But once I escaped, I came looking for you.

108
00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.100
I know that I found you Nina.

109
00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:38.649
Let's go to Texas.

110
00:06:38.649 --> 00:06:42.740
Mr. Luther, when this may Chloe hate you, it won't.

111
00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:46.399
I hope she hates me.

112
00:06:46.399 --> 00:07:25.279
I hope she can find happiness without me.

113
00:07:25.279 --> 00:07:29.399
Listen, I can tell that you really love her.

114
00:07:29.399 --> 00:07:33.819
Honestly, you should just take some time and talk to her.

115
00:07:33.819 --> 00:07:36.459
Maybe I would just make things worse.

116
00:07:36.459 --> 00:07:37.459
We should go.

117
00:07:37.459 --> 00:07:46.100
Mr. Luther, the CCTV has been disabled from the crime scene.

118
00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:49.100
But I'll block any news of your assassination.

119
00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:52.029
Who do you think is responsible?

120
00:07:52.029 --> 00:07:59.480
The gunman fired at you, but he killed Miss Morgan's father, framing you for the crime.

121
00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:02.480
There's only one person with this type of motivation.

122
00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:04.670
My dear brother.

123
00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:06.860
What's your plan?

124
00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:07.860
Think about that.

125
00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:18.500
Following the terrorist attack, Max Luther, the seal of Luther Brothers, remaining in coma.

126
00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:20.980
What are you doing?

127
00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:22.980
I'm capturing your beauty.

128
00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:25.980
We should take some with both of us in it.

129
00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:30.459
The car is here. Texas is waiting. Come on.

130
00:08:30.459 --> 00:08:38.379
I don't want to go. I don't want to go.

131
00:08:38.379 --> 00:08:39.379
Why not?

132
00:08:39.379 --> 00:08:44.470
I've lived here for over a decade. I can't just leave behind all the memories.

133
00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:48.710
Even the unpleasant ones?

134
00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:52.580
You don't want to leave the place or the person.

135
00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:54.860
Hey, it's okay.

136
00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:57.860
Take your time to make your decision. I'll wait.

137
00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:05.529
Thank you, Lance.

138
00:09:05.529 --> 00:09:08.940
What? My brother's been shot.

139
00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:10.940
You just peer for a visit.

140
00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:13.940
He's unconscious. Do not disturb him.

141
00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:14.940
I'm his brother.

142
00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:16.940
If he realizes I'm here, I'll wake up.

143
00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:18.940
I like saving beauty.

144
00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:22.649
After all these years, living in your shadow.

145
00:09:22.649 --> 00:09:24.649
Look at you now.

146
00:09:24.649 --> 00:09:25.649
Laying there.

147
00:09:25.649 --> 00:09:27.740
Barely able to move.

148
00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:32.269
Fanny. Take my brother away.

149
00:09:32.269 --> 00:09:36.899
That's not going to happen. He's the leader of this family.

150
00:09:36.899 --> 00:09:37.899
Yeah?

151
00:09:37.899 --> 00:09:41.899
And do you think this family would win a vegetable at that?

152
00:09:41.899 --> 00:09:44.899
We wouldn't want a conniving imbecile either.

153
00:09:44.899 --> 00:09:46.029
Yeah?

154
00:09:46.029 --> 00:09:48.029
Interrupt me again and see what happens.

155
00:09:48.029 --> 00:09:51.610
We'll shoot you like I have people before me.

156
00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:52.610
Like you did me?

157
00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:55.590
What's going on?

158
00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:59.639
Just putting out some bait.

159
00:09:59.639 --> 00:10:02.059
See who the real murderer is.

160
00:10:02.059 --> 00:10:06.580
You are out of this family.

161
00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:08.580
You really think I'll cease this easily?

162
00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:09.779
Let him go.

163
00:10:09.779 --> 00:10:17.429
Come on.

164
00:10:17.429 --> 00:10:22.460
See ya brother.

165
00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:29.419
You said you're still in a coma.

166
00:10:29.419 --> 00:10:31.870
Did you come to see me?

167
00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:32.870
Just passing by.

168
00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:34.480
Sorry.

169
00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:38.639
You want to come in and have a cup of tea here?

170
00:10:38.639 --> 00:10:41.019
I'm with Lance now.

171
00:10:41.019 --> 00:10:46.059
Please send my apologies.

172
00:10:46.059 --> 00:10:48.509
I know you lucked him up in medicine.

173
00:10:48.509 --> 00:10:54.200
If you're really sorry, we shouldn't see each other.

174
00:10:54.200 --> 00:11:08.320
I'm going to be now.

175
00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:10.179
Did you kill him?

176
00:11:10.179 --> 00:11:11.179
Leave.

177
00:11:11.179 --> 00:11:12.179
Leave.

178
00:11:12.179 --> 00:11:13.179
With me.

179
00:11:13.179 --> 00:11:14.179
Now.

180
00:11:15.179 --> 00:11:18.179
You promised I'd be Mrs. Luther.

181
00:11:18.179 --> 00:11:19.860
Oh.

182
00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:22.860
You're still dreaming of becoming Mrs. Luther?

183
00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:24.460
At yourself?

184
00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:28.139
I'm like this because of you.

185
00:11:28.139 --> 00:11:32.419
You don't want to be a sewer rat for the rest of your life.

186
00:11:32.419 --> 00:11:37.940
Kill Max Luther and take back what's rightfully yours.

187
00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:51.460
What's wrong?

188
00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:55.529
Nothing.

189
00:11:55.529 --> 00:12:03.730
You know, I've always wondered why do you love me?

190
00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:09.110
You know, when I was a kid, I was such a wuss.

191
00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:11.110
Always crying when I was bullied.

192
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:13.879
That's why I'm attracted to you.

193
00:12:13.879 --> 00:12:17.549
Because you're so strong, Nina.

194
00:12:17.549 --> 00:12:24.720
Always fighting for yourself.

195
00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:41.539
You know, I've always loved the way you small.

196
00:12:41.539 --> 00:12:44.539
Pying on me crazy?

197
00:12:44.539 --> 00:12:46.539
I just wanted to make sure that you were okay.

198
00:12:46.539 --> 00:12:49.539
I'm so stupid to believe you would mend your ways.

199
00:12:49.539 --> 00:12:52.700
I don't know what you're doing, but whatever it is.

200
00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:53.700
Wait.

201
00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:54.700
Oh, wait.

202
00:12:54.700 --> 00:13:12.620
From me and Lance.

203
00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:13.620
Steve, my best friend.

204
00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:18.899
I told you I meant nothing to Max.

205
00:13:18.899 --> 00:13:25.259
You are so disgusting.

206
00:13:25.259 --> 00:13:32.019
You have everything handed to you on a silver platter, but you just don't care.

207
00:13:32.019 --> 00:13:37.019
If you really meant nothing to Max, then why did he keep you by his side?

208
00:13:37.019 --> 00:13:39.019
He was doing it to torture me.

209
00:13:39.019 --> 00:13:40.600
Why?

210
00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:43.820
Because you killed his sister?

211
00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:44.820
Listen.

212
00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:46.889
Here's the truth.

213
00:13:46.889 --> 00:13:49.879
I caused Lily's death.

214
00:13:49.879 --> 00:13:52.909
I sold you to the dark web.

215
00:13:52.909 --> 00:13:55.360
I killed your father.

216
00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:59.360
And I framed it on Max with you.

217
00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:03.220
Because I hate you.

218
00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:05.220
I hate your gut.

219
00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:09.600
Everyone knows Nina is the name for perfection.

220
00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:10.600
I like your dress.

221
00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:11.600
Where did you get it?

222
00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:12.600
It's my mom's.

223
00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:13.600
Really?

224
00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:15.600
I can tell because it's ugly as fuck.

225
00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:16.600
Stop!

226
00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:17.600
Nina.

227
00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:18.600
You okay?

228
00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:23.740
That's fine.

229
00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:26.740
You and Max are such a perfect match.

230
00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:29.809
As if out of a fairy tale.

231
00:14:29.809 --> 00:14:37.960
But it's precisely because everything is too perfect that it tempts one to destroy it.

232
00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:43.970
That stupid chick.

233
00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:45.970
She brought it all on herself.

234
00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:47.970
Let go of me.

235
00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:49.970
Why does it smell so sour?

236
00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:51.970
Don't touch me.

237
00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:52.970
Alright guys, alright.

238
00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:53.970
I'll figure it out.

239
00:14:53.970 --> 00:15:02.019
It should have been me who was locked up by those monsters and treated like a whore.

240
00:15:02.019 --> 00:15:03.019
What?

241
00:15:03.019 --> 00:15:04.019
Lily.

242
00:15:04.019 --> 00:15:05.019
What are you doing?

243
00:15:05.019 --> 00:15:07.019
She stumbled upon us.

244
00:15:07.019 --> 00:15:13.019
Then I realized maybe it wasn't an accident but a chance to ruin you, Nina.

245
00:15:13.019 --> 00:15:15.019
My dear best friend.

246
00:15:15.019 --> 00:15:16.019
It's not my fault.

247
00:15:16.019 --> 00:15:19.240
You told us to do this to her.

248
00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:23.529
You think Max will believe this?

249
00:15:23.529 --> 00:15:25.529
You killed his sister.

250
00:15:25.529 --> 00:15:29.980
The Luther family will skin you alive.

251
00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:53.190
They're so goable.

252
00:15:53.190 --> 00:15:55.190
I just made some stuff up.

253
00:15:55.190 --> 00:15:57.190
And they bought it.

254
00:15:57.190 --> 00:16:00.190
I've been manipulating you and Max.

255
00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:02.639
This entire time.

256
00:16:02.639 --> 00:16:03.639
Why?

257
00:16:03.639 --> 00:16:05.629
Nina.

258
00:16:05.629 --> 00:16:07.629
You clean up another Max.

259
00:16:07.629 --> 00:16:08.950
Nina.

260
00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:09.950
Is that you?

261
00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:12.549
Stay away Max.

262
00:16:12.549 --> 00:16:14.549
I want Nina to be safe.

263
00:16:14.549 --> 00:16:27.110
Come to my warehouse.

264
00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:28.909
Nina.

265
00:16:28.909 --> 00:16:48.159
Don't you shove me into hell.

266
00:16:48.159 --> 00:16:52.929
Donnie, if you want to be head of the Luther family, it's yours.

267
00:16:52.929 --> 00:16:55.759
That doesn't tell me anymore.

268
00:16:55.759 --> 00:17:05.500
If you want Nina, you say alive and kiss my shoe.

269
00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:06.500
Max, don't.

270
00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:07.529
It's okay.

271
00:17:07.529 --> 00:17:09.579
Max, don't.

272
00:17:09.579 --> 00:17:34.549
At the great?

273
00:17:34.549 --> 00:17:38.019
Kissing my shoes.

274
00:17:38.019 --> 00:17:40.019
Oh, I enjoy this.

275
00:17:40.019 --> 00:17:43.119
It's about time I'll arrive with you.

276
00:17:43.119 --> 00:18:24.759
Nina.

277
00:18:24.759 --> 00:18:26.269
I'll give you some privacy.

278
00:18:26.269 --> 00:18:29.029
Nina.

279
00:18:29.029 --> 00:18:30.029
What are you doing here?

280
00:18:30.029 --> 00:18:34.269
I just came to check on you.

281
00:18:34.269 --> 00:18:36.619
Oh, you keep doing this.

282
00:18:36.619 --> 00:18:38.849
You don't owe me anything.

283
00:18:38.849 --> 00:18:40.849
I made it even at the warehouse.

284
00:18:40.849 --> 00:18:49.819
Take care of her, Lance.

285
00:18:49.819 --> 00:18:52.819
There's something that I've been hiding from you.

286
00:18:52.819 --> 00:18:56.049
I know you've been working for Max all along.

287
00:18:56.049 --> 00:18:58.049
It's not only that.

288
00:18:58.049 --> 00:19:04.170
I've learned about your suffering in the dark web a long time ago.

289
00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:09.259
I just, I decided to keep it away from Max.

290
00:19:09.259 --> 00:19:11.480
I was selfish.

291
00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:19.019
If you can't forgive me, I, I will leave.

292
00:19:19.019 --> 00:19:20.019
I'm glad you confessed.

293
00:19:20.019 --> 00:19:23.500
It just shows me I made the right choice.

294
00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:31.970
I know I couldn't get over Max, but now I think it's time to move on.

295
00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:32.970
Let's go to Texas.

296
00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:48.009
I promise you, I'll love you for the rest of my life.

297
00:19:48.009 --> 00:19:50.420
Let's go to Texas.

298
00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:51.420
I love you.
