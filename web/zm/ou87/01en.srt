1
00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:12,740
I need Mr. Rosemary.

2
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,419
Where are you, Mr. Rosemary?

3
00:00:14,419 --> 00:00:16,199
You're married to the beast's set.

4
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:17,199
Stop shruggling.

5
00:00:28,489 --> 00:00:30,129
She's not here.

6
00:00:30,129 --> 00:00:31,170
Keep looking.

7
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:49,679
Either my cute.

8
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:06,049
He'd drunk me or something.

9
00:01:06,049 --> 00:01:09,159
I made it strong.

10
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:11,560
Too bad I didn't see her face.

11
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,040
Boston, here you are.

12
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,200
You're contract wedding to the human families in three days.

13
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,760
The elders need you back to get ready.

14
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,000
Wedding?

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,260
I just found my mate.

16
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:25,420
Even if I do marry that human girl, she'll never be my luna.

17
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:27,519
But I just marked her.

18
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:30,239
Find out who she is.

19
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:32,480
But your bride's arriving tomorrow.
