00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:12.189
I've already made this bite mark, now all I have to do is add a drop of my blood.

2
00:00:12.189 --> 00:00:14.130
But why can't I finish it?

3
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.480
Awesome.

4
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.309
It feels like something's blocking me.

5
00:00:21.309 --> 00:00:22.309
Arrghh.

6
00:00:22.309 --> 00:00:28.109
Arrghh.

7
00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.940
I've since found his mate.

8
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.780
Use his hair and do a little magic, although I need him to know I'm his only mate.

9
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.579
To temper with a mate bond, it's a sin against the moon god as I can't.

10
00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.060
Do I need to remind you what happened the last time someone crossed me?

11
00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.060
Do it!

12
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:48.469
Arrghh.

13
00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:49.469
Arrghh.

14
00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:50.469
Arrghh.

15
00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:51.469
Arrghh.

16
00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:52.469
Arrghh.

17
00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:53.469
Arrghh.

18
00:00:53.469 --> 00:01:01.640
The spell will dull his ability to sense his bond mate.

19
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.599
With the thick mark on your neck, he will think you're his mate.

20
00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:14.060
But he must stay away from his real mate or the spell won't last.

21
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.060
Maybe it's his nerves.

22
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:28.500
Shall we try the first step again?

23
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.500
So sweet.

24
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:30.500
Why is it so familiar?
