1
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:09,080
All right, damn weddings tomorrow.

2
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:13,880
Alpha Austin, do you take Ms. Rosemary to be a love-related wife?

3
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,820
This is an arranged marriage.

4
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:21,570
I already have a meet, so do yourself a favor and stay in your place, human.

5
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:22,870
To have and to honor.

6
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:24,480
Yes, I do.

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,399
Ms. Rosemary.

8
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:26,399
You would like this marriage?

9
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:28,239
Well, finally, something we can agree on.

10
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:31,339
Would you like to take your worst possible pick for us, Pat?

11
00:00:31,339 --> 00:00:33,479
A foster-lawful husband.

12
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:34,979
To have and to hold.

13
00:00:34,979 --> 00:00:36,179
Yes.

14
00:00:36,259 --> 00:00:43,039
Ladies and gentlemen, with the power vested in me, I'd like to pronounce husband and wife.

15
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:46,770
Alpha Austin, you may kiss the bride.

16
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:48,829
There's no way Austin's kissing much.

17
00:00:48,829 --> 00:01:05,390
Ramp.

18
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:07,189
It's just for show.

19
00:01:07,189 --> 00:01:08,629
It doesn't mean anything.

20
00:01:08,629 --> 00:01:10,430
He's not even looking at her.
