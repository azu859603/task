00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
Austin!

2
00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:07.250
Alpha Austin, you can now crown the loaner.

3
00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:09.599
What's wrong with me?

4
00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.619
I must be out of my mind.

5
00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:15.070
She doesn't need that.

6
00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.070
The wedding's over.

7
00:00:19.899 --> 00:00:20.899
Remember what you said?

8
00:00:20.899 --> 00:00:23.250
Stay in your lane, Alpha.

9
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:34.140
Get it together.

10
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.140
He's nothing more than an arrogant jerk.

11
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.579
Nice move at the wedding.

12
00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:43.350
I could tell you scared the hell out of your group.

13
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.630
I'm Maya.

14
00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.100
Austin's sister.

15
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.100
We're gonna be besties in the pack.

16
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.060
Come on, not that look.

17
00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.219
Sorry, it's just... you don't seem like your brother.

18
00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.219
Yeah.

19
00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:03.219
He can be a real pain sometimes, but he's not that bad.

20
00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:06.409
He just needs... time.

21
00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:07.409
It's fine.

22
00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.409
I don't really care.

23
00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:10.409
I have more important things to worry about.

24
00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.150
Can I ask you a question?

25
00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:17.150
Sure.

26
00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:18.150
Anything.

27
00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.150
Have you ever heard of a couple nearby who lost a child 18 years ago?

28
00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.049
Is this about your birth parents?

29
00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.049
I heard the Rosemary's treated you poorly.

30
00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.049
I can't imagine what you went through for all those years.

31
00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.079
Don't worry.

32
00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:34.079
I will speak to my contacts.

33
00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.239
We will find your parents.

34
00:01:36.239 --> 00:01:41.980
Excuse me.

35
00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.650
After parties about to start, enjoy yourself.
