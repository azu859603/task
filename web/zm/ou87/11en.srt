1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
That's enough.

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:08,220
Austin, you have no idea what she said to me, she was so rude.

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,220
No, you've gone too far.

4
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:11,220
What?

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:14,279
She's human.

6
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:18,660
You know better than to use your wolf against someone who can't defend themselves.

7
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,660
Plus, you're my mate.

8
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:27,420
I need you to protect the pack, not cause problems.

9
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:28,420
Right.

10
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:37,649
Look at that in mine.

11
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:38,649
Dress.

12
00:00:40,219 --> 00:00:41,219
Whoa!

13
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:59,060
You seem to be putting yourself in the middle of everything and get ready for the party.

14
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:06,849
You'll see what it means to cross the werewolf.

15
00:01:06,849 --> 00:01:14,450
I need a new dress.

16
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:21,480
I think I have something that will work for tonight.

17
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:26,280
So, I heard you say that human girl from some trouble.

18
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,280
I had to say I've never seen you so worked up over a girl.

19
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,730
It's kind of refreshing.

20
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:35,239
I did it just for the pack. That's all.

21
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:37,500
Yeah, sure.

22
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,500
Whatever you say.

23
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,739
Seriously.

24
00:01:40,739 --> 00:01:44,739
Did Ariana almost shift into her wolf in front of that human girl?

25
00:01:44,739 --> 00:01:47,129
I mean, really?

26
00:01:47,129 --> 00:01:50,540
Yeah, it was kind of weird.

27
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:53,629
It's almost like she couldn't take the human without reverting to her wolf.

28
00:01:53,629 --> 00:01:54,629
What are you saying?

29
00:01:54,629 --> 00:02:00,959
Just, do we really think she's my mate?

30
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:06,390
Maybe Ariana's just feeling threatened.

31
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:10,389
Jealousy can make people do crazy things, you know how she gets.

32
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:13,900
Why can't I mark her?

33
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:19,009
Why can't I feel my bond anymore?

34
00:02:19,009 --> 00:02:20,009
Something doesn't add up.

35
00:02:20,009 --> 00:02:26,300
I need you to look into it.

36
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,300
By the way.

37
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,300
Tonight's the first full moon since you found your mate.

38
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,300
So you're probably going to mating heat.

39
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,500
And it's also your wedding month.

40
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,590
So, what are you going to do about that?

41
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:50,050
I can't wait to watch that bitch make a fool of herself.

42
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:53,050
Her ready dress was soaked.

43
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:56,050
She'll work right up or showing her face.

44
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,050
Absolutely.

45
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:02,909
The time she learned really belongs here.

46
00:03:02,909 --> 00:03:04,909
Oh my.

47
00:03:04,909 --> 00:03:06,909
Is that Austin's bride?

48
00:03:06,909 --> 00:03:12,340
She's stunning.

49
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:17,060
They make a perfect couple.

50
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,060
No way.

51
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:38,490
I gotta say, you're a lucky man.

52
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:43,289
Looks like your bride is quite the center of attention.

53
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:49,259
I couldn't care less.

54
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,800
I told you, Austin doesn't give a damn

55
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,800
about that sludge for us like a total whore.

56
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,800
Absolutely.

57
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,830
No matter how much attention she gets.

58
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:04,830
Austin won't even blink.

59
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:17,209
No, no, of course not, Austin.

60
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:18,209
It's just a misunderstanding.

61
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:21,449
Excuse me.

62
00:04:21,449 --> 00:04:31,500
Thank you.

63
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,500
So you enjoy being docked at?

64
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,500
What?

65
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,569
What did you just say?

66
00:04:36,569 --> 00:04:47,180
What?

67
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,180
Who gave you permission to dress like that?

68
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:53,980
Fruit went to my dress.

69
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,980
This is all I could find.

70
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:59,980
My dress is a family tradition worn only by the Luna of the back.

71
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,980
Are you so desperate to be my Luna?

72
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:02,980
No, I didn't know that.

73
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:03,980
My have found it for me.

74
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:04,980
She was just trying to help.

75
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:07,980
I'm sorry if there was a misunderstanding.

76
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:11,850
You are my wife in name only.

77
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:14,509
Distress right now.

78
00:05:14,509 --> 00:05:16,920
Happy?

79
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:37,959
He's just gonna drive me crazy.

80
00:05:37,959 --> 00:06:04,019
No.

81
00:06:04,019 --> 00:06:05,019
You're disgusting.

82
00:06:05,019 --> 00:06:09,699
You're disgusting.

83
00:06:09,699 --> 00:06:12,699
Austin, here's the dress you requested.

84
00:06:12,699 --> 00:06:14,370
How thoughtful.

85
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:18,199
Braille, return your precious dress as soon as I take it off.

86
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:28,620
I should feel that way only about my mate.

87
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:44,540
No matter how special she is.

88
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,600
Ariana is our mate.

89
00:06:46,600 --> 00:07:06,269
I knew some folks aren't afraid to get their hands dirty.

90
00:07:06,269 --> 00:07:09,259
I need to dig up a few old contacts.

91
00:07:09,259 --> 00:07:10,259
The rogues.

92
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:19,779
I've talked to all of my friends.

93
00:07:19,779 --> 00:07:21,779
But give an eye out for us.

94
00:07:21,779 --> 00:07:23,509
Don't worry, Lucy.

95
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:25,769
We'll find your parents.

96
00:07:25,769 --> 00:07:26,769
Thanks, Maya.

97
00:07:26,769 --> 00:07:28,769
I don't know what I do without you.

98
00:07:28,769 --> 00:07:30,829
It's not a big deal.

99
00:07:30,829 --> 00:07:34,829
You know, werewolves have more ways to track people than humans.

100
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:37,829
Sight, sound, vision.

101
00:07:37,829 --> 00:07:42,370
It's very easy for us to find someone.

102
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:45,370
So, you and Austin, huh?

103
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:46,720
How's it going?

104
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,720
Is it being nice to you?

105
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:54,490
Um...

106
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:57,540
Just normal.

107
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,339
Normal?

108
00:07:59,339 --> 00:08:02,019
No way.

109
00:08:02,019 --> 00:08:04,019
Werewolves go all out when they mate.

110
00:08:04,019 --> 00:08:06,019
Especially in Alpha.

111
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:07,019
You're human, are you?

112
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:08,019
Sure.

113
00:08:08,019 --> 00:08:09,019
You can handle that.

114
00:08:09,019 --> 00:08:10,910
Come on.

115
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:11,910
Tell me.

116
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:13,519
Excuse me, Miss Rosemary.

117
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:15,519
Alpha Austin wants to see you in the garden.

118
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:16,519
He said it's important.

119
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:18,610
Oh, wow.

120
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:22,769
You two can't stay away from each other for more than a minute, huh?

121
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:26,240
What's he up to now?

122
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,240
Didn't he mess with me enough last time?

123
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,240
Is this another one of his games?

124
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:38,000
Alpha Austin?

125
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,960
Are you here?

126
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:47,940
What do you want?

127
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:51,970
We're just here to teach you a little lesson, sweetheart.

128
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:56,970
You should have known better than to mess with someone out of your league.

129
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:57,970
So...

130
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:00,120
So...

131
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,120
So...

132
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:07,059
Which arm do you use to flirt with men?

133
00:09:07,059 --> 00:09:10,059
Because we're gonna make sure you never use it again!

134
00:09:10,059 --> 00:09:32,450
It seems so tense tonight.

135
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:35,450
Maybe I can help you relax a little.

136
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:41,029
Not tonight, Ariana.

137
00:09:41,029 --> 00:09:43,029
Go get some rest.

138
00:09:43,029 --> 00:09:50,019
What was that?

139
00:09:50,019 --> 00:09:52,200
It's a howl.

140
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,200
It's a full moon tonight.

141
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,200
It happened.

142
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,200
Look.

143
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,740
I've got to go.

144
00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:01,200
Say or another.

145
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,200
You're mine.

146
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:09,240
You took something that didn't belong to you.

147
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,240
And now...

148
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,240
You're gonna pay.

149
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,240
It's just so unfortunate.

150
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,240
We have to ruin that pretty face of yours.

151
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:24,070
Oh, no.

152
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:28,149
Touch our hand only the last thing you ever do.

153
00:10:28,149 --> 00:10:41,259
We're gonna make our way out.

154
00:10:41,259 --> 00:10:42,259
No trouble.

155
00:10:42,259 --> 00:10:43,259
No.

156
00:10:43,259 --> 00:10:52,940
All right.

157
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:53,940
Out of here.

158
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,940
If I see you again, you're a rat.

159
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:06,139
Humans are so fragile.

160
00:11:06,139 --> 00:11:10,690
You're safe.

161
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:45,480
They're gone.

162
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,480
You're the last person I want to bond with.

163
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,480
And I don't want to be your luna.

164
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,480
Fine.

165
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,480
Then I'll leave you here just like you want it.

166
00:11:52,480 --> 00:12:03,590
And fragile.

167
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:12,779
How was that?

168
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:13,980
I can walk.

169
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,740
And you'd be crawling by morning.

170
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:26,100
What are you doing?

171
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:43,350
Trying to.

172
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:45,379
Moon didn't apply some ointment.

173
00:12:45,379 --> 00:12:50,629
You thought what?

174
00:12:50,629 --> 00:12:51,700
Nothing.

175
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,700
It's just...

176
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,009
I don't need ointment.

177
00:12:55,009 --> 00:12:57,009
My wounds feel pretty fast on the room.

178
00:12:57,009 --> 00:13:00,299
Being strong doesn't mean you need to be reckless.

179
00:13:00,299 --> 00:13:11,039
This should help prevent infection and speed up the healing.

180
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:16,669
He's actually kind of handsome when he's not being annoying.

181
00:13:16,669 --> 00:13:19,700
Maybe he's not as bad as I thought.

182
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,139
Did I hurt you?

183
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:23,370
No.

184
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:24,460
No, it's fine.

185
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:27,659
I just don't need that much treatment.

186
00:13:27,659 --> 00:13:30,330
Well, just keep it dry.

187
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:32,710
I should heal up nicely.

188
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:43,710
Lucy, I'm not trying to argue.

189
00:13:43,710 --> 00:14:09,110
But really not feel anything in the-

190
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:10,690
Feel anything?

191
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:11,690
Nothing at all.

192
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:13,009
Why?

193
00:14:13,009 --> 00:14:16,480
He already has his mate.

194
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,019
Can't fall for him.

195
00:14:18,019 --> 00:14:20,019
He doesn't need to know what I'm feeling.

196
00:14:20,019 --> 00:14:21,629
It's nothing.

197
00:14:21,629 --> 00:14:25,690
Night must just be exhausting.

198
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:26,690
Yeah.

199
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:30,039
There's no way I could have a mate bond with a human.

200
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:32,039
It just doesn't make sense.

201
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:35,039
Well, you seem to be more than capable.

202
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:36,039
Taking care of yourself.

203
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:51,590
For a second, I almost thought he was being nice.

204
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:56,779
Brain.

205
00:14:56,779 --> 00:14:57,779
Want some tea?

206
00:14:57,779 --> 00:15:07,080
I'm stepping out for a while.

207
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:10,080
Thought I shouldn't give you a heads up.

208
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,779
What?

209
00:15:11,779 --> 00:15:15,059
You're leaving the pack?

210
00:15:15,059 --> 00:15:16,059
What?

211
00:15:16,059 --> 00:15:17,059
You're leaving the pack?

212
00:15:17,059 --> 00:15:18,470
Oh my god.

213
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:21,470
I am so sorry.

214
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:24,470
Uh, yeah, I'll be out for a while.

215
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:26,470
Probably won't get home until late.

216
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:46,679
Sorry I dropped.

217
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:50,679
I didn't see anything seriously in the tiny world.

218
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:51,740
Nothing happened.

219
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:52,740
Turn around.

220
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:58,230
Are you sure you two are done?

221
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:01,230
I can wait outside if you need a few more minutes.

222
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:02,230
No.

223
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:03,230
No.

224
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:05,230
It's just a huge misunderstanding.

225
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:08,230
I just spilled tea.

226
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:12,000
I'm just going to get out of here.

227
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Okay.

228
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,639
Let me see.

229
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:21,860
Oh, well, right.

230
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:26,210
We got the results on why you can't mark Ariana yet.

231
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:35,659
I talked to the elders about it and they said it's rare but not impossible that mates can't fully mark each other.

232
00:16:36,659 --> 00:16:37,659
I see.

233
00:16:37,659 --> 00:16:39,049
It's been two weeks.

234
00:16:39,049 --> 00:16:41,620
You still can't mark her.

235
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:42,620
What's going on?

236
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:44,360
I don't know.

237
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:48,190
I just can't complete the mark.

238
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:51,580
I don't even feel the bond with her, Alex.

239
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,899
It's just not there like it should be.

240
00:16:53,899 --> 00:16:56,250
What is wrong with me?

241
00:16:56,250 --> 00:17:01,159
There's one more thing.

242
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:05,160
You're probably not going to want to hear but the rose that attacked Lucy.

243
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,960
They've got ties to Ariana.

244
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:08,960
What?

245
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:18,369
So you've been seeing other guys behind Austin's back.

246
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:20,619
Such a little tramp.

247
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:21,619
Austin.

248
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:23,940
Austin.

249
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:34,789
You have no idea what that little tramp has been up to.

250
00:17:34,789 --> 00:17:39,380
Is that Lucy?

251
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,380
And her new boy, Toy.

252
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:44,380
They're meeting at the blue owl tonight at eight.

253
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,380
You have to go catch him in the act.

254
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:54,470
I warned you to stay away from Lucy.

255
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:56,470
But clearly you can't control yourself.

256
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:57,470
Listen.

257
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:59,470
Did you send the rogues after her?

258
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:01,470
No, I didn't do that.

259
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:04,599
You obviously don't know how to behave.

260
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:07,049
So I will have to teach you.

261
00:18:07,049 --> 00:18:08,910
Guard?

262
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:13,930
Ariana is on house rest for the week.

263
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:16,930
She's not to leave this room unless I give permission.

264
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,930
Austin, I'm your mate.

265
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:20,930
You can't do this to me.

266
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:22,930
Austin!

267
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:28,930
Maya's got a call.

268
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:31,500
So where should we start?

269
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,500
You said you know something about my parents?

270
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,500
Yeah, I reached out to some old contacts.

271
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,500
They said about 18 years ago,

272
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,500
a couple in the area lost their daughter.

273
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,500
Thought it might be worth looking into.

274
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,630
18 years ago.

275
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:45,630
That's when I was adopted.

276
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:47,630
They could be my parents.

277
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:49,630
Yeah, but there's something else.

278
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:51,660
A couple.

279
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,619
They're werewolves.

280
00:18:53,619 --> 00:18:54,619
Werewolves?

281
00:18:54,619 --> 00:18:57,349
Can't be right.

282
00:18:57,349 --> 00:18:59,609
I'm just human.

283
00:18:59,609 --> 00:19:00,609
Yeah.

284
00:19:00,609 --> 00:19:02,609
I know it sounds strange, all right.

285
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:05,609
But somewhere wolves don't show their abilities right away

286
00:19:05,609 --> 00:19:07,609
or even at all.

287
00:19:07,609 --> 00:19:10,740
Hey, I still think this lead my worth looking into.

288
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:13,720
Don't worry, okay?

289
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,859
I'm all here for you.

290
00:19:16,859 --> 00:19:29,500
So, you left the pack to sneak out and watch see this guy?

291
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:35,140
You really are good at playing the victim, huh?

292
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,140
So sweet and innocent.

293
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,140
What?

294
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,140
Are you talking about Marcus?

295
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,140
Is he here to help?

296
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,140
Help?

297
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:43,420
What kind of help?

298
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:45,420
The kind of help that makes you forget that you're married?

299
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:46,420
What is your problem?

300
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,420
Isn't it your business who I talk to?

301
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,420
None of my business.

302
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:53,809
You are my wife, Lucy.

303
00:19:53,809 --> 00:19:55,809
I have every right to know what you're up to.

304
00:19:55,809 --> 00:19:58,809
Your wife, in name only, remember?

305
00:19:58,809 --> 00:20:01,809
You've got your precious mate, so stop acting like you have any

306
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:02,809
sayin' what I do.

307
00:20:02,809 --> 00:20:04,809
I am done with this.

308
00:20:04,809 --> 00:20:06,190
I am leaving.

309
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:08,190
No, Lucy!

310
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:12,750
Stay away from her.

311
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:13,980
Austin, stop it!

312
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:16,980
Do you have any idea what is going on?

313
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:20,809
I am the one who brought Lucy here.

314
00:20:20,809 --> 00:20:23,809
Marcus was just trying to help her find her family.

315
00:20:23,809 --> 00:20:24,809
What?

316
00:20:24,809 --> 00:20:30,720
Any idea what Lucy has been through?

317
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:35,460
The Rosemary's treated her like trash.

318
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:40,460
Barely clothed, barely fed, and bullied by her step-sister every

319
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:42,740
single day.

320
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:46,740
And now you, her so-called husband, is just making her life worse.

321
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:47,740
I do.

322
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:48,740
No!

323
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,349
You're being a total jerk.

324
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:53,349
All she cares about is finding her family.

325
00:20:53,349 --> 00:20:56,930
And all you care about is your stupid jealousy.

326
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:59,819
You're right.

327
00:20:59,819 --> 00:21:02,329
I messed up.

328
00:21:02,329 --> 00:21:09,339
It's gonna be okay.

329
00:21:09,339 --> 00:21:12,240
I'll find Mom and Dad.

330
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,720
I just have to keep believing.

331
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:19,619
I say not.

332
00:21:19,619 --> 00:21:31,309
I'm so sorry.

333
00:21:31,309 --> 00:21:35,390
I-I didn't mean to get anything worse.

334
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:36,779
Just go.

335
00:21:36,779 --> 00:21:39,480
Leave me alone like you always do.

336
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:51,500
You were spending the night together.

337
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,500
No running off, Austin.

338
00:21:53,500 --> 00:22:02,289
Maya, it looks like we're stuck together for the night.

339
00:22:02,289 --> 00:22:17,700
I'm so sorry.

340
00:22:18,819 --> 00:22:21,109
I'm an idiot.

341
00:22:21,109 --> 00:22:25,069
I should never have tried to control you like that.

342
00:22:25,069 --> 00:22:28,700
I just-I don't know what came over me.

343
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:29,700
I couldn't stop it.

344
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:43,119
Promise.

345
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:46,589
Find your parents.

346
00:22:46,589 --> 00:22:48,740
I have more resources.

347
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:50,740
I-I know more people than Maya.

348
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:53,160
I'll do whatever it takes.

349
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,160
You're not alone in this.

350
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:57,250
Can I trust you this time?

351
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:01,190
Why am I doing?

352
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:06,829
I shouldn't deny the moon goddess, but I just want to kiss her.

353
00:23:06,829 --> 00:23:12,740
He's so dangerous.

354
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,740
But why do I want to believe him?

355
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:49,789
Austin, are you okay?

356
00:23:49,789 --> 00:23:54,130
What are you doing here?

357
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:57,130
I heard you got locked in, so I grabbed the spare key.

358
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:58,130
I hope I'm not too late.

359
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:00,160
You got here just in time.

360
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,160
Thanks, Alex.

361
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:11,019
How was that?

362
00:24:11,019 --> 00:24:29,289
It's like you should get some rest.

363
00:24:29,289 --> 00:24:30,289
It's so helpful.

364
00:24:30,289 --> 00:24:35,609
What?

365
00:24:35,609 --> 00:24:39,609
Austin didn't punish them, and now he's sending people to find Lucy's parents?

366
00:24:39,609 --> 00:24:41,609
I can't let that happen.

367
00:24:41,609 --> 00:24:45,490
You're locked down.

368
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:50,019
I need you to find someone for me.

369
00:24:50,019 --> 00:24:56,599
I'm no see.

370
00:24:56,599 --> 00:24:57,599
Dear sister.

371
