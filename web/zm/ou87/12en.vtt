00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
What do you want?

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.030
Ariana wasn't lying.

3
00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:07.030
This little bitch really struck it rich.

4
00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:10.220
The family business is struggling and we need money.

5
00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:14.220
I know your old husband is rich and can help us out.

6
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.219
It's time you do your duty as a good daughter.

7
00:00:17.219 --> 00:00:20.420
The moment you sold me off like a bargaining chip,

8
00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.420
I stopped being a rosemary.

9
00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.829
You were barking up the wrong tree.

10
00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:31.050
Lucy, you're up.

11
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:38.929
I just finished up in the garden and brought you these.

12
00:00:38.929 --> 00:00:49.659
M.G.

13
00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:52.659
This is it. You're having an affair with the gardener.

14
00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:53.950
How scandalous.

15
00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.109
Shut up, Emily.

16
00:00:56.109 --> 00:01:00.109
If you don't want me to tell your husband about your little affair,

17
00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:03.009
you know what to do.

18
00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:06.390
Hand over the money.

19
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.709
Don't embarrass yourself, Emily.

20
00:01:09.709 --> 00:01:12.709
You've really outdone yourself this time, huh?

21
00:01:12.709 --> 00:01:15.709
Bag yourself a handsome link.

22
00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:18.099
That's enough.

23
00:01:18.099 --> 00:01:19.319
What?

24
00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:23.319
You're afraid I'll tell Mr. Gardener about what a little slut you are?

25
00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:28.540
Did you know that she was fooling around with another man the night before her wedding?

26
00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.540
She even still had marks on her neck.

27
00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.930
Marks? What marks?
