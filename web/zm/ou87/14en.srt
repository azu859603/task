1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
What did you just say?

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:02,960
She has a mark like mine?

3
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,830
Yeah, exactly.

4
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:06,469
Right on her neck, same spot.

5
00:00:06,469 --> 00:00:08,029
When did you see this?

6
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:10,230
The night before she came back here,

7
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:11,789
she came home late,

8
00:00:11,789 --> 00:00:15,380
said she was assaulted by a strange man.

9
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:17,260
The night before she got here,

10
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:20,219
that's when Austin said he found his mate.

11
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:22,579
It's Lucy?

12
00:00:22,579 --> 00:00:24,379
So why do you two have the same mark?

13
00:00:24,379 --> 00:00:26,539
Is it a tattoo or something?

14
00:00:26,539 --> 00:00:28,500
Did you do it on purpose?

15
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,969
Who else knows about this?

16
00:00:30,969 --> 00:00:32,210
I guess just me.

17
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:34,929
Who else cares about that little tramp anyway?

18
00:00:34,929 --> 00:00:36,200
Why?

19
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,679
Is it some kind of secret?

20
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:45,979
What?

21
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:47,460
I don't have any marks on my neck.

22
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,659
Oh sweetie, you're about to.

23
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,359
What's going on in here?
