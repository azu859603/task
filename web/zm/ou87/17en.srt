1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,399
Get out! All of you!

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,820
You can't even bring Austin back your useless face!

3
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:13,099
You seem to be doing perfectly fine.

4
00:00:13,099 --> 00:00:17,100
Austin, you're here. I knew you'd come. I really haven't been feeling well.

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:22,100
You cut the act, Ariana. I know you're fine. This charade ends now.

6
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:28,100
Austin, I've been grounded for five days and you've never came. I really wanted to see you.

7
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:34,299
Look at what you've done. You're my mate and all you've done is bring chaos to the pack.

8
00:00:34,299 --> 00:00:37,899
Keep this up and I'll be forced to reject you.

9
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:44,390
You can't go against the Moon Goddess as well.

10
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:47,390
I don't care what the Moon Goddess says.

11
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:49,710
We are not a fit and I don't love you.

12
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:53,710
If you rejects me, the Moon Goddess will punish you.

13
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:58,710
You lose your wolf, Austin. Are you willing to risk that for your astute little human?

14
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:04,219
Yes. So, let's go ahead and get this over with.
