1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:04,719
If you lose your wolf, Austin, the pack will see you as weak.

2
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:07,179
You'll lose your business standing.

3
00:00:07,179 --> 00:00:11,900
Who would want to partner with a werewolf who lost his power?

4
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,699
Austin, no.

5
00:00:13,699 --> 00:00:17,199
You can't lose your wolf. You can't take that risk.

6
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:23,920
It's okay. Don't worry.

7
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,539
This is your last chance, Ariana.

8
00:00:28,539 --> 00:00:31,300
Do something like this again,

9
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,000
and I don't care what the moon goddess does.

10
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:43,549
I will reject you.

11
00:00:43,549 --> 00:00:44,950
What are you looking at?

12
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:46,549
You think this is funny?

13
00:00:46,549 --> 00:00:48,049
Stupid little twerp!

14
00:00:48,049 --> 00:00:49,590
No, no, I just...

15
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:52,469
I just thought the lunar assembly is coming up

16
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:54,689
on the office and their luna, so I invite it.

17
00:00:54,689 --> 00:00:58,060
Maybe it's a good opportunity.

18
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,859
You're right.

19
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:02,759
I need everyone to think I'm Austin's luna.

20
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:05,459
Not some stupid little human.
