1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:10,529
She looks just like I know, but apparently they moved to Europe after they lost their daughter and no one knows where.

2
00:00:10,529 --> 00:00:16,510
I'm sorry Lucy, I wish I had more.

3
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:23,050
Um, Lucy, there's something you need to know.

4
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:27,050
I'm sorry. I'm just not in the mood right now.

5
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:30,050
No, I promise it's good news.

6
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:33,270
They can wait a few days though.

7
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:40,259
Besides, there's something I need to take care of first.

8
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:47,880
Damn it. She's luckier than I thought. The whole plan is ruined.

9
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:53,880
Are you sure that Lucy has his mate? Ariana, this is a dangerous game you're playing.

10
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,939
I'm sure. She has the mark.

11
00:00:56,939 --> 00:01:02,939
I can feel it, Mom. Every time she's been around, Oz has been so cold and distant.

12
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:05,939
He can't find out I'm not his true mate.

13
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:10,069
Ariana, toxic woman. Why not have you been hiding from me?
