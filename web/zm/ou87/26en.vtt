00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:03.100
I can explain.

2
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:04.099
Elphosin.

3
00:00:04.099 --> 00:00:06.099
This is not Ariana Flint.

4
00:00:06.099 --> 00:00:08.099
Elphosin, I love you so much.

5
00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:09.099
I just wanted you to-

6
00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:12.099
Even if you wear my mate, you can't hurt Lucy.

7
00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:17.339
Thank God he didn't hear that.

8
00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:18.339
I didn't.

9
00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:21.339
I know everything.

10
00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:27.269
You set a trap for Lucy, and you lured her into Leo Mason's room.

11
00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.500
I've given you so many chances, but this time, no more.

12
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.200
I'm rejecting you.

13
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.200
What?

14
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.200
You- you're gonna reject me?

15
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.200
For that slut?

16
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.200
Stop calling her that!

17
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.200
No, you can't.

18
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.200
You'll lose your wolf, Elphosin.

19
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.200
You know what happens when you reject your mate.

20
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.200
Grab her!

21
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.710
You regret this, Elphosin.

22
00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.710
You really sacrifice your wolf without woman?

23
00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:59.710
I will.

24
00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:05.049
I won't let her hurt Lucy again.

25
00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:09.049
By the will of the moon goddess, I reject you as my mate, Ariana.

26
00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:11.239
We are no longer bound.

27
00:01:11.239 --> 00:01:13.939
It's done.

28
00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:18.209
Why don't I feel the pain?

29
00:01:18.209 --> 00:01:20.239
Isn't rejecting the mate supposed to hurt?

30
00:01:20.239 --> 00:01:23.549
Why is my wolf still here?

31
00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.189
Isn't she my mate?
