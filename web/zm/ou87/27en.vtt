1
00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:09.679
Oh, fuck. They found them. They're all their way. They can't wait to meet Miss Lucy.

2
00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:40.799
It must be a backlash from the witches' bell. Are you okay? They're sacriplets. Everything for him is my only my fix it.

3
00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:52.359
Don't make me repeat myself. Do you want to live or not?

4
00:00:52.359 --> 00:01:06.390
I-I-I thought of your child. Will be a bond strong enough to make him feel attached to you. That might work.

5
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:17.010
This child? Sure. I'll have his child.

6
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:24.760
He really has been dead and wife now. But he still has his mate. What am I supposed to do?

7
00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.760
Did you hear? Alpha Orson rejected Ariana. Wild stuff.

8
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.560
What? So does that mean he lost his wife?

9
00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.200
What's gonna happen to our pack? We're screwed, right?

10
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:48.290
Austin is still the strongest Alpha this pack has ever seen, and he's not going anywhere. Stop talking nonsense.

11
00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:58.349
No matter what happens, I am sticking by Austin. We'll handle this together.

12
00:01:58.349 --> 00:02:03.829
Austin, it must hurt so much.

13
00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:19.719
You heard. It's my supergirl crying. And I still have my wolf.

14
00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:37.180
Really? You are correct. I rejected Ariana. And now, there's nothing in between us.

15
00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:46.539
Remember that good news I was telling you about? What is it? What is it?

16
00:02:46.539 --> 00:03:10.069
Come up to the room tonight. Then everything will be prepared and you'll find out.

17
00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:36.629
Lucy, you're doing good. Wait, no.

18
00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:40.590
Austin, I'm right. Why are you sitting in the dark?

19
00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:52.319
What? No. Thanks. Lucy, this isn't what it looks like.

20
00:03:52.319 --> 00:04:02.840
This is a surprise you had for me.

21
00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.840
It's not what you're thinking. I thought she was you.

22
00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.830
You thought she was me? That's supposed to make me feel better?

23
00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:18.740
You're right. I am just your wife in name only. Everything you said, it's bullshit.

24
00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:20.240
I guess I never really knew you.

25
00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.740
Please. You have to believe me.

26
00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:41.360
I want to believe anymore, Austin. But this? It's all too much. I need some space.

27
00:04:41.360 --> 00:05:06.980
No. Are you going to get that?

28
00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:33.360
Maybe if I think you want to...

29
00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:41.620
Hey sweet girl. We've been searching for you for so long.

30
00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.290
You're...

31
00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:54.060
You're parents. Lucy.

32
00:05:54.060 --> 00:06:00.060
You were just two years old. I looked away for just two seconds and your stroller was gone.

33
00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:03.060
You can't imagine how much we missed you.

34
00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:18.129
I missed you too. I always knew you were out there some way.

35
00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:21.129
We never stopped searching. Not for a moment.

36
00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:26.819
We never thought you'd be adopted by a human family.

37
00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:43.470
Human? You're a werewolf, Lucy. And so are you.

38
00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:48.779
Yes, darling. You're one of us.

39
00:06:48.779 --> 00:06:54.420
Your wolf hasn't awakened yet. But you've probably started to notice.

40
00:06:54.420 --> 00:07:01.569
Our family bloodline has extraordinary healing powers.

41
00:07:01.569 --> 00:07:16.149
Healing powers. When Austin was affected by the drug, I wasn't.

42
00:07:16.149 --> 00:07:20.519
You're strong, Lucy.

43
00:07:20.519 --> 00:07:22.870
You're stronger than you ever realized.

44
00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:28.079
Thank you so much, Elphost.

45
00:07:28.079 --> 00:07:31.110
We never would have found our way here.

46
00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:33.110
If you haven't reached out to us.

47
00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:42.860
Austin, you found us? Yes, Elphost and tracked us down.

48
00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:45.860
We couldn't have done this without him.

49
00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:57.199
You have a good man here, Lucy. We're so happy for you.

50
00:07:57.199 --> 00:08:02.490
He's done so much for me. And all I've done is push him away.

51
00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:07.970
Maybe. Maybe it really was just a misunderstanding.

52
00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:15.839
Meeting Lucy was the best thing that ever happened to me.

53
00:08:15.839 --> 00:08:28.050
She means the world to me. And I promise I'll do everything I can to protect her.

54
00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:39.750
We couldn't have asked for a better man.

55
00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:42.750
Mr. and Mrs. Blackwell, the guest room is ready.

56
00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:46.750
I'm sure your journey was long, and you must be very exhausted.

57
00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:51.860
Alex here will show you to your room.

58
00:08:51.860 --> 00:09:07.100
You know you did all this for me, Austin. Thank you.

59
00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:13.929
Lucy, I know things between us haven't necessarily been easy,

60
00:09:13.929 --> 00:09:19.519
but I need you to know that everything that I've done,

61
00:09:19.519 --> 00:09:30.110
I've done because I love you, are my Luna, Lucy.

62
00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:34.419
And I want everyone to know it.

63
00:09:34.419 --> 00:09:36.419
We'll have a Luna ceremony for you.

64
00:09:36.419 --> 00:09:41.929
And the entire back will know that you will always be by my side.

65
00:09:41.929 --> 00:10:27.929
You're going to be a dad.

66
00:10:27.929 --> 00:10:32.309
Oh, I just wanted to congratulate you on becoming Austin's Luna.

67
00:10:32.309 --> 00:10:38.389
I know love can't be forced, so I'm moving on.

68
00:10:38.389 --> 00:10:39.389
You better mean that.

69
00:10:39.389 --> 00:10:43.830
You've only got yourself to blame, bitch.

70
00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:49.830
Now that you're a werewolf, let's see how much you enjoy this little silver treat.

71
00:10:49.830 --> 00:11:22.049
I'll have to go. Enjoy breakfast.

72
00:11:22.049 --> 00:11:24.049
It looks delicious.

73
00:11:24.049 --> 00:11:27.419
Well, how was it?

74
00:11:27.419 --> 00:11:29.419
It tastes just as good as it looks.

75
00:11:29.419 --> 00:11:31.940
Here, you should try something.

76
00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:37.870
Are you okay? Should I call a doctor?

77
00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:39.870
No, no, I'm fine.

78
00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:45.409
Actually, there's something I want to tell you.

79
00:11:45.409 --> 00:11:47.570
What's that?

80
00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:52.940
Um, Austin, are you okay?

81
00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:56.340
What's wrong?

82
00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:57.340
Austin, are you okay?

83
00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:12.399
Body's been poisoned by silver.

84
00:12:12.399 --> 00:12:15.720
Body isn't strong enough to recover on its own.

85
00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:16.720
You need his mate.

86
00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:19.259
She's the only one that can wake him up.

87
00:12:19.259 --> 00:12:22.779
His mate? You mean Ariana?

88
00:12:22.779 --> 00:12:25.779
I'm not his mate anymore. He rejected me.

89
00:12:25.779 --> 00:12:27.779
There's nothing I can do.

90
00:12:27.779 --> 00:12:30.779
But you were once his mate. That bond doesn't just vanish.

91
00:12:30.779 --> 00:12:34.779
Just because he rejected you, that residual connection could be enough to help him.

92
00:12:34.779 --> 00:12:37.779
Please, let's give it a chance. Just touch him.

93
00:12:37.779 --> 00:12:42.690
Okay, here is only hope.

94
00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:45.690
It should be the bitch lying here, not Austin.

95
00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:47.690
There's no way I can save him.

96
00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:48.779
Damn it.

97
00:12:48.779 --> 00:12:50.779
Please, Ariana.

98
00:12:50.779 --> 00:13:13.929
Why is it working?

99
00:13:13.929 --> 00:13:21.129
She really was his true mate. We should have seen some by now.

100
00:13:21.129 --> 00:13:24.129
It's got to be because Austin rejected her.

101
00:13:24.129 --> 00:13:28.129
No matter what, a rejected mate's power gets weakened.

102
00:13:28.129 --> 00:13:32.129
Yeah, I really was his mate. He just rejected me.

103
00:13:32.129 --> 00:13:45.250
She couldn't stand talking about this, but isn't true?

104
00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:58.860
You promised to always be my best.

105
00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:18.779
His vitals. They're improving.

106
00:14:18.779 --> 00:14:23.190
Lucy, you will Austin up.

107
00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:25.639
You're his mate.

108
00:14:25.639 --> 00:14:32.340
This mate?

109
00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:35.259
Told you she was the one that poisoned him.

110
00:14:35.259 --> 00:14:38.259
That's why he's getting better. She must have given him the antidote just now.

111
00:14:38.259 --> 00:14:40.419
That is ridiculous.

112
00:14:40.419 --> 00:14:44.419
You heard the one who poisoned him, aren't you?

113
00:14:44.419 --> 00:14:46.419
Ariana has a point.

114
00:14:46.419 --> 00:14:51.419
Alpha Austin collapsed after eating the food that Lucy fed to him.

115
00:14:51.419 --> 00:14:55.450
We've got to lock her up until we get to the bottom of this.

116
00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:58.450
Yeah, she's a human. And humans are greedy.

117
00:14:58.450 --> 00:15:01.450
She probably only wanted Alpha Austin's money.

118
00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:30.200
You promised divorce papers.

119
00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:31.580
What's this?

120
00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:38.220
You're pregnant? You're pregnant?

121
00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:42.899
Oh dear you. You don't deserve to have his child.

122
00:15:42.899 --> 00:15:45.440
Ariana.

123
00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:53.220
Even if you want her dead, it can't happen here.

124
00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:57.659
You're right. Letting her die so easily would be too kind.

125
00:15:57.659 --> 00:16:11.659
Where's Lucy?

126
00:16:11.659 --> 00:16:18.159
Lucy, she's been accused of poisoning you, and she's locked away in the West Tower.

127
00:16:18.159 --> 00:16:22.490
What?

128
00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:27.120
Austin, Austin, are you okay?

129
00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:32.029
It was you, wasn't it?

130
00:16:32.029 --> 00:16:36.419
You said Lucy poisoned me. That's ridiculous.

131
00:16:36.419 --> 00:16:41.419
Austin, I'm your mate. Would you rather believe that slut over me?

132
00:16:41.419 --> 00:16:45.580
The only right thing I ever did with you was reject you.

133
00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:50.019
Get out of my way. I'm going to see my wife.

134
00:16:50.019 --> 00:16:53.019
You're not going anywhere.

135
00:16:53.019 --> 00:16:57.850
She's somewhere you'll never find.

136
00:16:57.850 --> 00:17:02.840
If you want to keep her alive, divorce her.

137
00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:05.670
I'm saying her.

138
00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:09.150
Make me your Luna, and that'll keep her safe.

139
00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:13.160
Ariana!

140
00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:15.160
Go ahead, kill me.

141
00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:19.160
And I promise you'll never see her or the little rider in her belly.

142
00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:28.279
What are you talking about? What are you talking about?

143
00:17:28.279 --> 00:17:30.279
That's right. That bitch is pregnant.

144
00:17:30.279 --> 00:17:34.279
And if you ever want to see your gun, you'll play by my role.

145
00:17:35.279 --> 00:17:40.680
Pregnant?

146
00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:51.859
Alpha, I just want to let you know everything's ready for the Luna ceremony tomorrow.

147
00:17:51.859 --> 00:17:56.559
But I guess that won't be happening. I'll postpone it.

148
00:17:56.559 --> 00:18:00.559
There's no need to postpone. Just switch the Luna.

149
00:18:00.559 --> 00:18:04.559
I want everyone to know I'm the rightful Luna of this pack.

150
00:18:04.559 --> 00:18:06.559
Noah, that's not happening.

151
00:18:06.559 --> 00:18:08.940
Oh, really?

152
00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:11.940
Would you rather I become your Luna?

153
00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:17.650
Or do you want that little tramp in her spawn to die?

154
00:18:17.650 --> 00:18:18.650
No!

155
00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:32.960
Lucy, too.

156
00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:36.359
Can she be our mate?

157
00:18:36.359 --> 00:18:49.859
Is the moon goddess punishing us? Any word on Lucy?

158
00:18:49.859 --> 00:18:51.380
No.

159
00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:56.130
You're covering your tracks well.

160
00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:59.740
Are you really going to let Ariana become your Luna?

161
00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:04.589
If it means saving Lucy and the baby?

162
00:19:04.589 --> 00:19:05.589
Yes.

163
00:19:05.589 --> 00:19:24.259
Where's Austin?

164
00:19:24.259 --> 00:19:25.259
Austin?

165
00:19:26.259 --> 00:19:30.259
He's a little preoccupied right now.

166
00:19:30.259 --> 00:19:33.259
Is marrying my daughter.

167
00:19:33.259 --> 00:19:42.019
Declaring her as his Luna.

168
00:19:42.019 --> 00:19:46.019
He never loved her. All you're doing is stealing someone else's husband.

169
00:19:46.019 --> 00:19:48.019
How pathetic.

170
00:19:48.019 --> 00:19:54.279
You're dead. You really think you're the Luna?

171
00:19:54.279 --> 00:20:00.089
Look at you.

172
00:20:00.089 --> 00:20:03.089
No pregnant with the Alpha's child.

173
00:20:03.089 --> 00:20:06.089
You're just lucky. That drunk had to mess up.

174
00:20:06.089 --> 00:20:09.089
You'd be carrying a bastard right now.

175
00:20:09.089 --> 00:20:11.089
It's you.

176
00:20:11.089 --> 00:20:15.089
Of course. The rug's in the drunk. That was all us.

177
00:20:15.089 --> 00:20:25.410
I just can't believe why the moon goddess would choose a nobody like you to be the strongest Alpha's mate.

178
00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:27.470
It's your fault.

179
00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:28.470
Please.

180
00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:30.470
We're blocking my daughter.

181
00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:32.660
No.

182
00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:34.299
Please.

183
00:20:34.299 --> 00:20:36.299
But everything's going to be just fine.

184
00:20:36.299 --> 00:20:38.299
Soon enough.

185
00:20:38.299 --> 00:20:40.299
Ariana Hoffman.

186
00:20:40.299 --> 00:20:47.299
You vowed to serve as the Luna of this pack to protect its people and lead beside Alpha Austin Vinci as a sequel.

187
00:20:47.299 --> 00:20:48.299
I do.

188
00:20:48.299 --> 00:20:50.680
Alpha Austin Vinci.

189
00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:53.680
Do you vow to accept Ariana as your Luna?

190
00:20:53.680 --> 00:21:01.019
To guide your pack ever and protect your people with her by your side?

191
00:21:01.019 --> 00:22:17.329
I'm to place the Luna crown on your mate.

192
00:22:17.329 --> 00:22:24.150
Your Luna.

193
00:22:24.150 --> 00:22:31.660
Put it on me. You are not. You are not.

194
00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:37.920
I'm playing your games now.

195
00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:46.190
You're selling you need to know.

196
00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:59.299
Austin forced me. Ever been your trick.

197
00:22:59.299 --> 00:23:15.400
If it weren't for me trying to protect Lucy that I'd be playing any of these games with you?

198
00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:23.609
No, not.

199
00:23:23.609 --> 00:23:26.609
The price for what she did. And now it's your turn.

200
00:23:26.609 --> 00:23:29.700
You are the Luna of the pack. This is your call.

201
00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:33.930
You will be stripped of your werewolf powers.

202
00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:37.930
You will be banished from this pack and you will never come back.

203
00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:58.480
I don't know how I didn't see it before. It was you my bet that night.

204
00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:00.609
Oh, and it really hurt.

205
00:24:00.609 --> 00:24:35.240
Have you seen that tie that you got me last month? I couldn't find it.

206
00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:45.059
Oh, I just put it in the closet drawer. Did you check there? It's right here.

207
00:24:45.059 --> 00:25:24.259
What do you say tonight? We just four months old. What is she going to know?

208
00:25:24.259 --> 00:25:25.259
Where is my mother?

209
00:25:25.259 --> 00:25:39.450
My friend's daughter.

210
00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:40.450
Clean up the floor.
