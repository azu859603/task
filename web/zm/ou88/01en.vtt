00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.929
Where's your lost kid?

2
00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:31.440
Oh, dare you mess with my merger plans, you bitch.

3
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.600
You've been a housewife for 10 years.

4
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.159
What the hell do you know about running a company?

5
00:00:38.159 --> 00:00:40.770
Please, Tristan.

6
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.530
So my dad's here, I'll...

7
00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.609
I can't just have some respect.

8
00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.729
Your father knew that I was the only one

9
00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:55.289
fit enough to run Brian Industries.

10
00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.689
Not some useless little pooed like you.

11
00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.670
I think it's time you learned your lesson.

12
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.590
No more playing boss.

13
00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.159
From now on, you're gonna be a good housewife.

14
00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:14.859
We'll be trying, learning from your tricks in a sack.

15
00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:16.900
Help keep me entertained.

16
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.250
That is your job now.

17
00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.170
You knew that he wanted me to take over a CEO.

18
00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.409
Okay, Brian Industries was his legacy,

19
00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.290
and he made sure that in his will...

20
00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:40.319
I will?

21
00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:43.230
Just...

22
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.519
It hasn't been easy for me either.

23
00:01:45.519 --> 00:01:48.719
This funeral has been harder me too.
