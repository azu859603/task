1
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:10,019
Oh, what the hell happened?

2
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:13,980
Triss, that bastard.

3
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:21,019
Like the extra truck?

4
00:00:21,019 --> 00:00:32,560
I missed this.

5
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,560
Triss?

6
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,039
Yeah.

7
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:39,039
God, Ross.

8
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:43,060
You're on my little bitches back as such a thrill.

9
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:48,020
Just watching that clue of his face trying to take a big job makes me sick.

10
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:59,990
How much longer do you think we can keep this going on before?

11
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:01,990
I mean, it's been years already.

12
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:10,209
As long as it takes, once I have control of Brian Industries, I won't need her anymore.

13
00:01:10,209 --> 00:01:17,219
That could be just you, enemy, baby.

14
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:28,209
Okay, you're cheating scum bag. This is gonna cost you everything.

15
00:01:28,209 --> 00:01:34,489
Shit. This drive is still affecting me.
