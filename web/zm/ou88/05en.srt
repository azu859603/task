1
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:14,140
I have those divorce papers you ask for, Kendall.

2
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:16,739
Oh, thanks, Elliot.

3
00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:19,469
For keeping this in the down low.

4
00:00:19,469 --> 00:00:22,109
Oh, and a quick heads up, your new PA starts today.

5
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:23,789
He'll be here in a second.

6
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:28,399
I, um, one more of either, Elliot.

7
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:31,820
I need you to do some digging on Tristan.

8
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:37,119
I mean, check his finance to see if anything smells fishy.

9
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:38,759
I owe you one, Elliot.

10
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:59,119
You're acing this internship.

11
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:00,960
Good morning, Miss Bryant.

12
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,960
I'm Raymond, your new personal assistant.
