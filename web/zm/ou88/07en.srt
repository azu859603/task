1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,439
Sounds a little weird, but have we met before?

2
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:04,719
Sorry, doesn't ring a bell.

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,880
The bar? Some drunk asshole was hitting on you on your night.

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,449
Raymond, I don't know what you're talking about.

5
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:17,440
Now we both have jobs to do, so I suggest we focus on that.

6
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:19,440
Okay?

7
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:53,460
The rest of the conference is us, we start getting just like a fool.

8
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,460
We need to stand together out there tonight, babe.

9
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:00,920
This conference is a make-up break for us.

10
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:08,500
Look, guys, I think our VIP might be one of these guest-centrant.

11
00:01:10,219 --> 00:01:11,180
I think you're wrong.
