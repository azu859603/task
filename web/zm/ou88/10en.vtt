1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.319
HAHAHAHA

2
00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:06.259
KEDDLEBROHS

3
00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:14.949
That bitch doesn't have what it takes to bring this company

4
00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:20.179
I swear to find the way that in

5
00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:21.339
What the f...

6
00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:22.780
What's going on here?

7
00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:24.079
Mr. Carmine Are you alright?

8
00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:26.260
Juicy what the hell are you doing?

9
00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.019
Put that damn mic down

10
00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.219
Shut up bitch!

11
00:00:29.219 --> 00:00:32.840
I'm so sick of you trying to control it

12
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:33.619
You see?

13
00:00:33.619 --> 00:00:34.119
Yeah

14
00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:40.429
Why can't you just be a damn house boy?

15
00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:47.700
As far as can you comment on what this happens, it's true that your step in data CEO.

16
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.700
It's everything I'm doing with your marriage. You can start forming and having an affair.

17
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.700
As far as can you comment on your husband's outlandish behavior, is your travel and paradise?

18
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.700
Are the rumors of a business with Hideoi E. True? How long have you known?

19
00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:05.340
Are the rumors of a business with Hideoi E. True? How long have you known?

20
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:12.780
I'm Mr. Brian's personal assistant. I'm afraid we have to cancel the rest of this press conference.

21
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.780
Thank you all for understanding during this difficult time.

22
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:22.670
We'll provide an official statement whenever we have more information to share.

23
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.099
And a boy coming to your boss's rescue.

24
00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:44.189
I'm here to serve, though I got to say that was one hell of a performance, Mrs. Brian.

25
00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:59.629
Without you. But how did you know the champagne dressing gave me a spy?

26
00:01:59.629 --> 00:02:03.299
I overheard him talking to Ross about it.

27
00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.299
But I had to tell you right away because...

28
00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:09.300
I was unsure if they were actually going to pull through with it.

29
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.419
Look at that. Impressive, Mr. Detective.

30
00:02:14.419 --> 00:02:23.439
Listen, Kendall. What about that nightmare? I tell. I...

31
00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:31.590
What the hell? You mean we look like a f***ing idiot?

32
00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:38.300
Sign this! Hand over control of Brian Industries. Your father's legacy deserves better.

33
00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.319
Terry, you bring my father into this.

34
00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:45.319
When you've just been counting down the day so he keeps the f*** it?

35
00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:51.530
That's enough. Get Ross, Grandpa.

36
00:02:51.530 --> 00:03:01.060
I think you can just waltz in here and steal my wife your little piece of shit.

37
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:10.159
Your damn mouth. Okay, he's just the new assistant.

38
00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:14.479
You should go. I don't want to have you involved in this mess.

39
00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:19.639
I'm not leaving you alone with this scumbag. Especially after all this shit you pulled.

40
00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:23.150
Oh. Oh, I see how it is.

41
00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.310
Spreading your legs for the new help, are we?

42
00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.889
Wait until the media gets hold of this.

43
00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:32.889
Kendall Bright, CEO.

44
00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:37.139
Nothing but a cheap hole.

45
00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:41.139
Oh, that is rich, Tristan. Coming from you.

46
00:03:41.139 --> 00:04:07.430
Mate, honey. I have got all the dirt I need to bury you.

47
00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.560
The company, the money, everything, is all mine now.

48
00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:19.699
It's over, Tristan. I want a divorce.

49
00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:23.699
I am done being your punching bag and your doormat.

50
00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:25.699
Okay, okay, Kendall. Kendall, just think about this, okay?

51
00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:29.699
If you go through with that divorce, Tristan won't sign his shares to you.

52
00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:31.699
He'll take the company from you.

53
00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:35.790
Yeah, that's right, sweetheart. Listen, Ross.

54
00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:40.790
If you go through the divorce, Bryant Industries will be lying.

55
00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:45.879
Otherwise, I'll make your life a living hell.

56
00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:50.420
You really think I'll let you blackmail me?

57
00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:53.550
I have proof of your fear with Ross.

58
00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.550
Won't lead to the press and you'll take me.

59
00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.550
You know what, if that video gets out, it'll ruin all of us.

60
00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.550
Okay, public image of the company, your reputation, stock prices.

61
00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:06.550
I mean, oh my God, our rival will just be so happy.

62
00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:13.449
Speaking of rivals, what if I told you I'm here to make sure that none of you lay a hand on the company?

63
00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:19.370
Oh, my apologies, I forgot to introduce myself.

64
00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:23.370
I'm Raymond Diaz, heir to Diaz Global.

65
00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.220
Mark my words, Tristan.

66
00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:36.800
If you refuse to sign the divorce papers, I'll find a way to cease control of the company, and once that happens, you won't get a dime.

67
00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.800
Bryant, what are you doing?

68
00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.800
Leave Kendall alone, or I'll make sure you're gone.

69
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.860
For good.

70
00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.860
Just be careful, we don't know what this guy's capable of.

71
00:05:49.860 --> 00:06:15.410
Watch your back, Kendall.

72
00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:20.040
We don't think we're a second, you are out of the woods.

73
00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:26.439
You know what, Rich, and get the hell out of my company.

74
00:06:26.439 --> 00:06:27.439
Bitch.

75
00:06:27.439 --> 00:06:34.779
Boy, I've been growing hurt.

76
00:06:34.779 --> 00:06:50.319
I've been causing a scene.

77
00:06:50.319 --> 00:06:54.279
What have you said, grandpa?

78
00:06:54.279 --> 00:06:58.170
You two make a great couple.

79
00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:00.220
Thanks.

80
00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:02.500
You okay?

81
00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.949
So, Mr. Raymond Diaz.

82
00:07:05.949 --> 00:07:11.259
Are you really the heir to Diaz Global?

83
00:07:11.259 --> 00:07:20.889
Really the heir to Diaz Global?

84
00:07:20.889 --> 00:07:21.889
Gotcha.

85
00:07:21.889 --> 00:07:24.100
What?

86
00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:25.100
You were just about to think.

87
00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:28.100
Yeah, I totally improvised that.

88
00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:34.100
No, it's kind of convenient to pretend to be the son of a rich person and share the same last name.

89
00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:37.060
That was a thinking.

90
00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:40.060
I mean, what kind of heir would work as a parent?

91
00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:47.579
I'm so sorry for dragging you into this mess.

92
00:07:47.579 --> 00:07:51.339
Like, you must think I am such a loser.

93
00:07:51.339 --> 00:07:53.339
No, no, not at all.

94
00:07:53.339 --> 00:08:01.060
You can just say, I'll make pathetic, unattractive woman again.

95
00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:02.060
You can keep one's husband.

96
00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:04.060
Don't you ever say that, Kendall?

97
00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:06.379
You're stunning.

98
00:08:06.379 --> 00:08:13.829
I have not been able to stop thinking about you since, you know, ever since we met.

99
00:08:13.829 --> 00:08:23.779
I'm sorry, Raymond, but I don't know what you're talking about.

100
00:08:23.779 --> 00:08:25.779
That night, I was with my date, Ellie.

101
00:08:25.779 --> 00:08:33.700
Look, Raymond, he probably mistook me for someone else.

102
00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:37.370
He should go and get some rest.

103
00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:59.840
Hey, man.

104
00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:03.919
What's like, how?

105
00:09:03.919 --> 00:09:04.919
What's going on?

106
00:09:04.919 --> 00:09:10.120
Remember that woman I was telling you about?

107
00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:11.120
A hotel?

108
00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.120
Yeah.

109
00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:13.120
Yeah, the one you once saw.

110
00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.120
Yeah, and about.

111
00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.120
What about her?

112
00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:18.120
I think she might be my new boss.

113
00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:20.120
You mean, Kendall Bryant.

114
00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:24.940
I'm falling in love with her.

115
00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:26.940
I'm falling slow down, Romeo.

116
00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:34.779
Did you forget the real reason your old man sent you to Bryant Industries?

117
00:09:34.779 --> 00:09:37.779
You can't let your feelings for this woman cloud your judgment, bro.

118
00:09:37.779 --> 00:09:39.480
Book bird.

119
00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.639
The way she makes me feel.

120
00:09:41.639 --> 00:09:42.639
Oh, God.

121
00:09:42.639 --> 00:09:46.279
I can't get her out of my head.

122
00:09:46.279 --> 00:09:49.440
The touch of her skin, her soft lips.

123
00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.440
Yeah.

124
00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:51.440
Yeah.

125
00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:52.440
Look, I get that.

126
00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:57.919
But, look, your old man is counting on you to bring down Bryant Industries.

127
00:09:57.919 --> 00:10:01.919
If you screw this up, your future is the air to de-escalate.

128
00:10:01.919 --> 00:10:02.919
Well, guess what?

129
00:10:02.919 --> 00:10:05.299
I don't even want to be in air anymore.

130
00:10:05.299 --> 00:10:13.539
Look, just make sure that she's actually the one before you do anything stupid.

131
00:10:13.539 --> 00:10:14.539
You hear me?

132
00:10:14.539 --> 00:10:29.059
What the hell?

133
00:10:29.059 --> 00:10:30.059
Well, well, well.

134
00:10:30.059 --> 00:10:43.299
I can't believe I was married to that scumbag for years.

135
00:10:43.299 --> 00:10:46.299
It's like all the cheating and abuse wasn't enough.

136
00:10:46.299 --> 00:10:48.299
He even tried to steal my own company.

137
00:10:48.299 --> 00:10:50.720
It's all over now, right?

138
00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:54.070
You don't have to deal with any of that crap now.

139
00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:56.299
You deserve someone better.

140
00:10:56.299 --> 00:10:58.679
Someone who really cherishes him.

141
00:10:58.679 --> 00:10:59.679
Hey, Sally.

142
00:10:59.679 --> 00:11:02.259
Hey, I'm that new PA.

143
00:11:02.259 --> 00:11:04.259
Really helped me out of time with this.

144
00:11:04.259 --> 00:11:06.990
Good job on finding him.

145
00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:11.990
Does theater accent make you feel like falling in love again?

146
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:19.370
Um, maybe I would if I hadn't already slept.

147
00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:21.370
Wait, what?

148
00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:24.370
I mean, your PA is a one-night stand.

149
00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:29.860
So, that's your type.

150
00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:38.870
Pretty boy like him.

151
00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:39.870
Raymond?

152
00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:40.870
Don't.

153
00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:43.929
She's with another man.

154
00:11:43.929 --> 00:11:45.929
After everything we shared?

155
00:11:45.929 --> 00:11:46.929
Listen to yourself, man.

156
00:11:46.929 --> 00:11:48.929
You had a one-night stand.

157
00:11:48.929 --> 00:11:49.929
That's it.

158
00:11:49.929 --> 00:11:53.629
You think about the real reason you're a Bryan Industries?

159
00:11:53.629 --> 00:11:54.629
I don't give a shit.

160
00:11:54.629 --> 00:11:57.629
I want to find out everything you can about the man she's with.

161
00:11:57.629 --> 00:12:00.850
The thing is, last thing.

162
00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:02.850
You're acting crazy, man.

163
00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:04.850
I'm worried about you.

164
00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:06.879
I've never seen you like this over a woman.

165
00:12:06.879 --> 00:12:12.950
Yeah, I don't know what's wrong with me.

166
00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:16.970
I want her, Bert.

167
00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:19.450
I'm falling for her, Bert.

168
00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:39.820
Bress! Bress!

169
00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:44.409
Looks like you ran into me.

170
00:12:44.409 --> 00:12:46.409
So, it looks like you owe me a fresh drink.

171
00:12:46.409 --> 00:12:48.409
You skank.

172
00:12:48.409 --> 00:12:51.879
They keep your hands off her.

173
00:12:51.879 --> 00:12:52.879
Throw you!

174
00:12:52.879 --> 00:12:53.909
I'm one of the owners of this bar.

175
00:12:53.909 --> 00:12:56.909
I can have you both kicked out and blacklisted.

176
00:12:56.909 --> 00:13:00.059
What are you doing here with this young man?

177
00:13:00.059 --> 00:13:02.059
Shouldn't you be at home right now,

178
00:13:02.059 --> 00:13:04.059
wearing when your husband will come home tonight?

179
00:13:04.059 --> 00:13:16.330
Security!

180
00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:17.330
Raymond?

181
00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:20.860
That's enough.

182
00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:21.860
Raymond?

183
00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:29.460
I thought you're here.

184
00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:33.419
This cycle right here just poured her drink on me.

185
00:13:33.419 --> 00:13:34.419
You okay?

186
00:13:34.419 --> 00:13:37.460
This is Jane.

187
00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:39.460
An old acquaintance.

188
00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:46.659
It was a misunderstanding.

189
00:13:46.659 --> 00:13:47.659
You know Ray.

190
00:13:47.659 --> 00:13:50.690
Well, let me tell you I'm honey.

191
00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:52.690
Him and I were engaged.

192
00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:54.690
We were so deeply in luck.

193
00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:55.690
Stop this.

194
00:13:55.690 --> 00:13:57.779
We broke up a long time ago.

195
00:13:57.779 --> 00:14:02.460
But, isn't she a bit too old for you?

196
00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:04.460
And definitely not good enough to be with you.

197
00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:06.460
Shut the fuck up Jane.

198
00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:13.289
Come on, let's go.

199
00:14:13.289 --> 00:14:14.289
And you.

200
00:14:14.289 --> 00:14:16.539
Stay the fuck away from her.

201
00:14:16.539 --> 00:14:27.889
You're way out of relief.

202
00:14:27.889 --> 00:14:31.179
Kendall, I'm so sorry about that.

203
00:14:31.179 --> 00:14:35.179
Jane, we broke up a long time ago because she cheated on me.

204
00:14:35.179 --> 00:14:37.179
We haven't talked in a while.

205
00:14:37.179 --> 00:14:41.029
I'm so sorry.

206
00:14:41.029 --> 00:14:45.029
I know how difficult it is dealing with a cheating partner.

207
00:14:45.029 --> 00:14:47.129
Nothing she said was true.

208
00:14:47.129 --> 00:14:49.129
I told you you were stunning the moment I met you.

209
00:14:49.129 --> 00:14:52.129
And I will say it a million more times.

210
00:14:52.129 --> 00:15:11.789
You're the most incredible woman I know.

211
00:15:11.789 --> 00:15:17.149
Hey, where we go?

212
00:15:17.149 --> 00:15:20.269
How could you break up with him?

213
00:15:20.269 --> 00:15:24.379
I have the nerve to come back.

214
00:15:24.379 --> 00:15:25.379
But a terrible mistake.

215
00:15:25.379 --> 00:15:27.379
I've regretted it ever since.

216
00:15:27.379 --> 00:15:28.480
Save it.

217
00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:29.480
Raymond's moved on.

218
00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:31.539
He's in love with that woman.

219
00:15:31.539 --> 00:15:38.159
The one you just had a confrontation with.

220
00:15:39.159 --> 00:15:44.159
Do tell me more about this woman that's managed to capture the heart of the Arab diasclobol?

221
00:15:44.159 --> 00:15:56.409
The heir of diasclobol.

222
00:15:56.409 --> 00:15:57.409
I am so sorry.

223
00:15:57.409 --> 00:16:01.409
I just got caught up in the moment and can we just forget that happened?

224
00:16:01.409 --> 00:16:08.539
I'll cast you tomorrow in the office fight.

225
00:16:08.539 --> 00:16:23.399
Let me at least give you a ride home.

226
00:16:23.399 --> 00:16:24.399
What?

227
00:16:24.399 --> 00:16:25.399
Something in my face?

228
00:16:25.399 --> 00:16:26.399
No.

229
00:16:26.399 --> 00:16:27.399
No.

230
00:16:27.399 --> 00:16:33.909
I'm just...

231
00:16:33.909 --> 00:16:39.620
Sorry.

232
00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:40.620
I'm fine.

233
00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:42.970
Yeah, I'm just heading home.

234
00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:45.610
You go enjoy the rest of your night.

235
00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:46.610
Listen.

236
00:16:46.610 --> 00:17:04.970
I think Raymond might be on to something about you.

237
00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:05.970
No, no.

238
00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:06.970
I couldn't believe it.

239
00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:07.970
It was great.

240
00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:17.299
You work here too?

241
00:17:17.299 --> 00:17:18.299
I'll see you guys later.

242
00:17:18.299 --> 00:17:19.420
Yeah.

243
00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:23.059
So did you hear about Kendall's divorce?

244
00:17:23.059 --> 00:17:25.059
Apparently, Tristan was cheating on her.

245
00:17:25.059 --> 00:17:26.059
Huh?

246
00:17:26.059 --> 00:17:27.059
Well, can you blame him?

247
00:17:27.059 --> 00:17:29.059
If she couldn't keep him satisfied.

248
00:17:29.059 --> 00:17:32.059
I know, she should just quit and become a stay-at-home housewife.

249
00:17:32.059 --> 00:17:34.059
That's the only way she'll have a happy marriage.

250
00:17:34.059 --> 00:17:40.430
Oops.

251
00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:41.430
Sorry.

252
00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:42.430
Are you kidding me?

253
00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:46.059
Didn't see you there.

254
00:17:46.059 --> 00:17:47.059
It's...

255
00:17:47.059 --> 00:17:49.059
Okay, um, accidents happen.

256
00:17:49.059 --> 00:17:51.890
So you're new in town?

257
00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:52.890
Yes.

258
00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:54.890
I'm Miss Bryant's new personal assistant.

259
00:17:54.890 --> 00:17:58.890
I overheard you guys talking about your boss.

260
00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:01.890
Miss Bryant is an amazing person and a great leader.

261
00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:04.269
Show some respect.

262
00:18:04.269 --> 00:18:10.259
Look, getting close to Kendall, it's not a good idea.

263
00:18:10.259 --> 00:18:13.390
Yeah, haven't you seen her unusual relationship with her?

264
00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:15.390
It's not a good idea.

265
00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:18.390
Yeah, haven't you seen her unusual relationship with that intern Elliot?

266
00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:20.390
Seems like something happened between her.

267
00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:21.390
That's none of your business.

268
00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:23.490
She's not like that.

269
00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:42.180
Look, I'm not sure what you're trying to pull here, but if you're not serious about Kendall...

270
00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:44.180
Stay the fuck away from me.

271
00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:48.740
I won't give up on Kendall.

272
00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:49.740
Not without a fight.

273
00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:54.220
Face it, man, I'm younger than you, and I'll go better than you ever will.

274
00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:59.569
I may be less experienced than you, but she'll be my first and only...

275
00:18:59.569 --> 00:19:00.569
Wait.

276
00:19:00.569 --> 00:19:02.569
So you still haven't slept with her?

277
00:19:02.569 --> 00:19:11.819
So she lied about how she spent the night with the other guy when she was actually with me?

278
00:19:11.819 --> 00:19:15.299
Huh, thanks.

279
00:19:15.299 --> 00:19:33.460
Elliot told me he overheard Jane calling you the heir of D.O.'s global.

280
00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:37.859
Are you really a spy, Raymond?

281
00:19:37.859 --> 00:19:45.849
Elliot, you're damn right.

282
00:19:45.849 --> 00:19:46.849
What's going on, Kendall?

283
00:19:46.849 --> 00:19:49.140
You were right about Raymond.

284
00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:52.140
He's probably a spy from D.O.'s global.

285
00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:55.329
I can't believe I fell for his act so easily.

286
00:19:55.329 --> 00:19:56.329
So?

287
00:19:56.329 --> 00:19:57.329
So?

288
00:19:57.329 --> 00:20:00.329
So, I need you to pick up everything you can on him.

289
00:20:00.329 --> 00:20:01.329
You got it.

290
00:20:01.329 --> 00:20:05.329
Oh, and speaking of D.S. global, there's CO's assistant invited you to a meeting.

291
00:20:05.329 --> 00:20:07.329
Smart thinking, Elliot.

292
00:20:07.329 --> 00:20:08.329
Set it up.

293
00:20:08.329 --> 00:20:20.609
The sooner we get to the bottom of this, the better.

294
00:20:20.609 --> 00:20:22.609
Kendall, you won't believe it.

295
00:20:22.609 --> 00:20:24.609
Great. I need to talk to you.

296
00:20:24.609 --> 00:20:27.609
You're right. You're not my one-night stand. I found her.

297
00:20:27.609 --> 00:20:28.609
Uh...

298
00:20:28.609 --> 00:20:29.609
Oh, hold up.

299
00:20:29.609 --> 00:20:30.609
What?

300
00:20:30.609 --> 00:20:31.609
What?
