1
00:00:01,169 --> 00:00:10,259
I mean a lot of people are into that.

2
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:11,609
Oh really?

3
00:00:11,609 --> 00:00:13,609
How do you know that boss?

4
00:00:13,609 --> 00:00:20,350
I remember I'm just a little confused.

5
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:28,539
How can you admit to marrying your one nightstand when your ex, the woman from the bomber, is still trying to win you back?

6
00:00:28,539 --> 00:00:31,339
Jane and I have history.

7
00:00:31,339 --> 00:00:33,729
She was my high school sweetheart.

8
00:00:33,729 --> 00:00:38,689
She must have been there a lot together. Me and a lot of memories.

9
00:00:38,689 --> 00:00:46,520
That's in the past, but as for the woman I saw from that night, I can't stop thinking about her.

10
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:52,960
She made me feel something I've never felt before. She's the one. I know it.
