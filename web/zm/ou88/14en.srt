1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,390
So then you're actually outside?

2
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:11,589
Miss Bryant!

3
00:00:11,589 --> 00:00:20,589
Oh my god, it's such a small world.

4
00:00:20,589 --> 00:00:23,390
I'm so sorry for what happened at the bar.

5
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:27,429
I had no idea you're the famous Kendall Bryant.

6
00:00:27,429 --> 00:00:29,230
It's just under the lights the bar

7
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:33,460
you looked a bit older.

8
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:34,700
Watch it.

9
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,060
It's OK.

10
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,799
At least we can skip the introductions.

11
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:40,759
Oh, you don't have to be like that sweetheart.

12
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:41,640
And you know what?

13
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,200
If we get our companies back together,

14
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,960
it would be the perfect alliance.

15
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,890
I'm sure Miss Bryant would like to see that, right?
