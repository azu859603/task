1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.900
Um, why don't we just discuss the business proposal?

2
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:14.960
Kendall, on behalf of DS Global CEO, I'd like to propose a collaboration on your upcoming hotel venture.

3
00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.960
We believe our resources and expertise could greatly benefit the project.

4
00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:33.590
I appreciate the offer, Jane, but I'm afraid I must decline.

5
00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.590
The hotel was a gift from my late father to my mother.

6
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.590
It's a personal thing, not a business opportunity.

7
00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:48.929
I had a feeling you'd say that, before you make your final decision.

8
00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:53.240
It looks like Mr. Corbin really knows how to have fun.

9
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:59.009
You wouldn't want such a scandal to ruin your company's reputation, would you?

10
00:00:59.009 --> 00:01:04.489
Reconsider our offer and you can ensure the secret stays under wraps.
