1
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:14,900
So that's my story when I'm not pretty depressing, huh?

2
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:16,899
And then there's my marriage to Tristan.

3
00:00:16,899 --> 00:00:21,969
You know, I thought he'd love me, but he only saw me as a stepping stone.

4
00:00:21,969 --> 00:00:25,260
I know the concept of trails and abuse it.

5
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,480
Shattered mainly, I never thought possible.

6
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,670
I'm so sorry, Kendall.

7
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:37,469
You've been through hell and you've faced it with such a strength and grace.

8
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:40,950
I admired more than you can ever think.

9
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:46,119
So what about you, Raymond?

10
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:48,979
What's your feeling really?

11
00:00:48,979 --> 00:00:51,979
Kendall, I need to tell you something.
