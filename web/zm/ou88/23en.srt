1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,459
Kendall, I need to tell you something.

2
00:00:04,459 --> 00:00:28,710
Yeah, I've decided to give it my right to my family fortune and step away from Diaz Global.

3
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:39,079
I'm in love with Kendall, and I'll come clean her tonight.

4
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:41,079
Confirmed, Raymond's identity.

5
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:50,179
Don't listen to a word he says, Kendall. You should know, Raymond is the heir to Diaz Global.

6
00:00:50,179 --> 00:00:51,179
What the hell are you doing here?

7
00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:52,179
He's a spy.

8
00:00:52,179 --> 00:00:55,270
Wasn't that the signal?

9
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:58,270
Time to put the plan to action, now that you've earned her trust.

10
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:01,270
Kendall, I swear to God it's not what you think.

11
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:03,270
I was going to tell you everything about it.

12
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,269
I can't do my doubts about you, but I just said it's trust you.

13
00:01:06,269 --> 00:01:10,269
Look, I opened up to you. I told you things. I had never shared with anyone and it was all just a big lie.

14
00:01:10,269 --> 00:01:11,269
No, but please.

15
00:01:11,269 --> 00:01:12,269
Don't!
