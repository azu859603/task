1
00:00:15,789 --> 00:00:17,149
What's going on?

2
00:00:17,149 --> 00:00:20,750
You drugged me, fucking bastard!

3
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,589
Rise, child, 8-minute.

4
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:25,070
You're just in time for the big show.

5
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:26,269
What are you talking about?

6
00:00:26,269 --> 00:00:28,670
Oh, you know, just a little murder suicide.

7
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:31,469
Heh, you couldn't handle Kendall Brian dumping you

8
00:00:31,469 --> 00:00:34,670
because you're a spy, so you offered her before killing yourself.

9
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:36,270
Classic, huh?

10
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,060
Don't hurt Kendall, please.

11
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:40,100
I'll do anything.

12
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,899
She killed my love, and now she's gonna pay for it.

13
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:48,140
What's going on?

14
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:50,140
Ross, where's Tristan?
