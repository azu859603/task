00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,320
Tristan! You killed him! Don't you dare say his name! Tristan's dead.

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:14,400
I did kill Tristan. You were there with me. All of it was in the reports to Ross.

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:21,300
You took everything from me. You know, I loved him. I actually loved him. I even stepped

4
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:26,500
back so you guys could get married. After the divorce, he lost everything. He's constantly

5
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:32,380
hiding drugs. He's never around me anymore. I don't expect you to know how it feels.

6
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:36,450
You know, if I can't have him, no one else can.

7
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:45,600
Curing, staying. What do you want from me? What, you? To sign all the company shares to me.

8
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,960
Time to pay for all the shit you've done to me.
