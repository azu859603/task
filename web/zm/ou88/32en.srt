1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,390
Miss Bryant, is it true that you abandoned your child?

2
00:00:04,309 --> 00:00:08,949
How can you leave a company when you couldn't even take the possibility for your own baby?

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:14,150
That's enough. Kendall's past has nothing to do with her ability to leave the company.

4
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:19,699
I'm standing by her side and I'll love her no matter what.

5
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:21,609
Period.

6
00:00:21,609 --> 00:00:23,769
Don't be so naive Raymond.

7
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:27,730
How can you trust a woman who kept such a huge secret from you?

8
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:30,730
Especially when you're about to marry her.

9
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:32,729
Raymond, I can't...

10
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:33,729
Raymond, that's not the truth.

11
00:00:33,729 --> 00:00:36,020
No, I don't.

12
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,020
What Miss Jane Shields just said is true.
