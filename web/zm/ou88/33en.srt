1
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:09,060
I know there have been a ton of gossip and rumors about my past.

2
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:16,219
When I was 16 years old, I found myself in a very difficult situation.

3
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:22,079
I was alone and scared and young.

4
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:27,079
And I made the heart-wrenching decision to give my baby up for adoption.

5
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:30,719
It was the hardest thing I've ever had to do in my life.

6
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:39,359
Now that you know my secret, you're so annoying me.

7
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:43,359
Yes, Kendall. I still want to spend the rest of my life with you.

8
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:47,609
Kendall is just saying that to protect me.

9
00:00:47,609 --> 00:00:50,609
For the accusation, it's a old crowd.
