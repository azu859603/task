00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:08.710
That's your pitch. I'm a very straightforward. Lucky you. That is exactly my time.

2
00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:32.740
Oh no, I've got it. Mom, what are you doing here? It's always so good to see you, too.

3
00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:35.060
How's work?

4
00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:42.500
Same boss, still great. I had more time off though. And have you decided I'm the name of the baby?

5
00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:45.299
Yeah, actually

6
00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:50.149
It's Emma.

7
00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:53.270
You can't name her that.

8
00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.950
Emma's your sister's name. That's exactly why I like it.

9
00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:05.189
I know she's not around anymore, but I figure that she would appreciate that I named our baby daughter after her.

10
00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.959
No, that was your grandma's gift for her and her only.

11
00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:13.000
I mean, your father and sister have been gone for decades.

12
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.439
Let's just let them stay in our memory and not try to replace mom.

13
00:01:18.239 --> 00:01:20.239
This is my house. I

14
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:30.120
Can't have you come in here and try to disrespect that. Sure. You'll get your respect when your daughter is old enough to talk, son.

15
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.200
I can't imagine how dad didn't get driven crazy by you.

16
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.069
Don't you ever talk about me and your father like that?

17
00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:47.890
I'm a grown man. I have a family now. You can't just drop by and tell me what to do. You clearly need the help.

18
00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:53.250
Not from an overbearing, old, sad, crazy woman like you.
