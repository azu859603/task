1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,600
Tom, that's too much.

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:08,179
Sorry, Mom, I didn't mean to.

3
00:00:08,179 --> 00:00:11,210
So that's what you think of me, Chris.

4
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:12,609
It's not like that.

5
00:00:12,609 --> 00:00:15,599
Take care of yourself, sweetheart.

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,199
Bob, where are you going?

7
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:18,800
Anywhere but here.

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,800
It's raining outside.

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:36,969
Please, just gotta be kidding me.

10
00:00:36,969 --> 00:00:57,829
What are you here?

11
00:00:57,829 --> 00:00:59,429
What do you want?

12
00:00:59,429 --> 00:01:01,689
Chris, it's me.

13
00:01:01,689 --> 00:01:02,689
What's wrong?

14
00:01:02,689 --> 00:01:03,689
Did someone upset you?

15
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:04,689
Sherry!

16
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:07,189
It's nothing.

17
00:01:07,189 --> 00:01:09,319
It's not like nothing.

18
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,319
You're better.

19
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:11,930
Are you outside?

20
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:15,329
My shitty car broke down in the middle of the woods.

21
00:01:15,329 --> 00:01:16,329
What?

22
00:01:16,329 --> 00:01:18,129
In this weather, in the middle of December?

23
00:01:18,129 --> 00:01:19,129
I'm going to pick you up.

24
00:01:19,129 --> 00:01:20,450
No, no, it's fine.

25
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:22,849
It's no reason for you to freeze out here too.

26
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:23,980
Where are you?

27
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:27,409
It's the more of Lincoln Road, I think.

28
00:01:27,409 --> 00:01:28,409
I'll be right there.

29
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:34,719
Don't move.

30
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:36,319
Go to Lincoln Road now.

31
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:40,120
Yeah, but how are you going to explain your identity?

32
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,120
What about me?

33
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,519
An overdrive as driver?

34
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:43,519
Sit down.

35
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:44,519
I'll drive.

36
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,180
Hey, baby.

37
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,180
You need a ride?
