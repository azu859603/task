00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:23.589
Oh, Chris, you didn't have to, oh, I could help.

2
00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:25.870
I'm almost done.

3
00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:26.870
Have a seat.

4
00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:27.870
I can.

5
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:28.870
Have a seat.

6
00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:29.870
Okay.

7
00:00:29.870 --> 00:01:00.020
Okay.

8
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:08.989
What are you looking at?

9
00:01:08.989 --> 00:01:09.989
A seat.

10
00:01:09.989 --> 00:01:12.719
You're incredible.

11
00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:22.989
This is the best breakfast I've had in years.

12
00:01:22.989 --> 00:01:24.500
Aww.

13
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.730
Flattered.

14
00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.409
Now, you mentioned us going to the auction today, does that still happen?

15
00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:30.409
Yes.

16
00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:35.829
And actually, we should start getting ready soon.

17
00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:37.799
Do I look okay?

18
00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.280
Like a dream.

19
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:50.780
But I do have a small present for you.

20
00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.780
It's beautiful.

21
00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.390
So sweet.

22
00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:17.050
Me.

23
00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.050
Do you think I've ever dressed?

24
00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.050
Not at all.

25
00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.050
This is who you are.

26
00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:26.219
Don't be shy.

27
00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:28.379
Look at this old mummy.

28
00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:29.780
You bought her new bandages.
