1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
1,100 going once.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,160
Why?

3
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:04,160
No, you don't deserve it.

4
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,160
15!

5
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:09,539
Dear, that album stocks with 1,000 at most.

6
00:00:09,539 --> 00:00:13,179
I know, I need it back.

7
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:14,269
20!

8
00:00:14,269 --> 00:00:18,269
1,000 from the lovely lady in the corner.

9
00:00:18,269 --> 00:00:19,269
2,000 going once.

10
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:21,269
What are you waiting for?

11
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:24,269
Don't tell me you're waiting for your ex-husband to save you again.

12
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:27,559
Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot.

13
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:28,559
He is dead.

14
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:29,940
Fine.

15
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:35,909
It's over.

16
00:00:36,909 --> 00:00:38,909
Mia is going to be the next captain.

17
00:00:38,909 --> 00:00:58,780
20,000 going twice.

18
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:00,840
30,000.
