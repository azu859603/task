00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
This is none of your business.

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.000
It is.

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
She is not alone.

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Gross.

5
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.000
32.

6
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Thank you, 32.

7
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
You lie here, 35.

8
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.000
70,000.

9
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.000
70,000.

10
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Are you serious?

11
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
You can't just say any random number.

12
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
You actually have to be able to pay for it.

13
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I can do this all day.

14
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Wing one.

15
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Fair warning, last call.

16
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.250
70,000 dollars.

17
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.339
70,000 dollars.

18
00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:32.340
70,000 dollars.

19
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.340
70,000 dollars.

20
00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.530
70,000 dollars.

21
00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.530
The oven clock is going to be lovely.

22
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.530
Couple in the center of the room.

23
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:40.530
Thank you very much.

24
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:41.530
Everybody please.

25
00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.530
A round of applause will be lovely.

26
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:44.530
Thank you.

27
00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:45.530
It's so much to me.

28
00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:46.530
It's so important.

29
00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.530
Oh, I'll pay you back later.

30
00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:48.530
It's my treat.

31
00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.530
I can't have my wife going home empty handed.

32
00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:57.619
But what's the matter?

33
00:00:57.619 --> 00:01:00.219
Take a closer look.

34
00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:01.219
Take a closer look.
