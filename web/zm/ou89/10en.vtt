00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:05.940
Ma'am, I needed to deliver this to you in person.

2
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.300
It is the most expensive item I've ever sold.

3
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.490
You're very lucky.

4
00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:13.970
Merry Christmas.

5
00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:14.970
Thank you, sir.

6
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:21.510
Is it the one you were looking for?

7
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:22.510
Baby?

8
00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:23.929
You all right?

9
00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:30.059
Breathe.

10
00:00:30.059 --> 00:00:34.700
What happened?

11
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.700
Is something wrong with it?

12
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.039
Yes.

13
00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:41.740
This belonged to you.

14
00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.960
My late husband bought this for me many years ago.

15
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:55.420
My most precious belonging.

16
00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:56.420
Give me one minute.

17
00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.130
Yeah.

18
00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.880
Okay.

19
00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:09.379
Tom, look, look.

20
00:01:09.379 --> 00:01:12.379
It happens not that your dad bought me 20 years ago.

21
00:01:12.379 --> 00:01:13.379
I thought I lost it.

22
00:01:13.379 --> 00:01:15.379
I got a call from my friend at the auction.

23
00:01:15.379 --> 00:01:18.379
$70,000 for this?

24
00:01:18.379 --> 00:01:19.379
Are you losing your mind?

25
00:01:19.379 --> 00:01:20.379
No, Tom.
