1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,209
You promised me that you would never touch climbing gear again.

2
00:00:04,209 --> 00:00:05,209
This is different.

3
00:00:05,209 --> 00:00:07,209
I don't fucking care!

4
00:00:07,209 --> 00:00:08,210
Please don't say that.

5
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:09,210
They're dead!

6
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:14,039
Dad and Emma are fucking dead!

7
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:18,070
Maybe if you wouldn't have fucking supported their stupid hobby,

8
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:21,100
it'd still be around.

9
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,100
It was an accident. You can't blame it all on me.

10
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,100
Is that not enough?

11
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:28,289
What, are you gonna take a new family up there to that death hype?

12
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:31,289
Or are you gonna reign until my daughter's poor and then do the same to her?

13
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:34,289
It's never my intention. Please don't say that.

14
00:00:34,289 --> 00:00:37,289
Look at me.

15
00:00:37,289 --> 00:00:40,289
You are never welcome in my home again.

16
00:00:40,289 --> 00:00:44,380
And if you want to go die, go die alone.

17
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:46,380
No, Tom. Tom, wait!

18
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:54,159
Oh!

19
00:00:54,159 --> 00:01:01,179
Chris! Chris! Chris! Chris! Chris!

20
00:01:01,179 --> 00:01:06,640
Chris! Oh, Chris! Are you okay? What happened?

21
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:12,049
It's fine. Just family quarrel.

22
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:16,780
If this keeps happening, I'm gonna need to have a little talk with your family.

23
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,780
Oh, let me see that here. Come here.

24
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:24,180
Oh, what's your daughter?

25
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,780
Oh, 22.

26
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:31,250
Ever have any difficulties with her?

27
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:36,099
I don't even know where to start.

28
00:01:36,099 --> 00:01:41,780
I have you.

29
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:50,459
What do you say we forget about those damn kids and go have a drink?

30
00:01:50,459 --> 00:01:51,650
How about that?

31
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:58,090
I have a good back.

32
00:01:58,090 --> 00:01:59,090
Everything all right?

33
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:22,069
Yeah, it just feels like this isn't the first time I've been born.

34
00:02:22,069 --> 00:02:25,219
My home is home.

35
00:02:25,219 --> 00:02:28,080
I wouldn't know.

36
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:34,500
Sometimes it's hard to recall memories, early ones, especially it.

37
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,520
They'll just kind of fall apart.

38
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,539
Have you gotten that checked out?

39
00:02:40,539 --> 00:02:42,639
Yeah, Doctor says I'm fine.

40
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:47,120
It's just, I guess the old grain matters are seeing what it used to be.

41
00:02:47,120 --> 00:03:02,050
Did you find yourself a pro?

42
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:07,050
Great question. Jerry, this is my buddy Antoine Heat bones this place.

43
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:10,050
Antoine, this is Jerry, my husband.

44
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:11,050
Your husband?

45
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:13,050
Wow, that's interesting.

46
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:15,050
Uh, beg your pardon?

47
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:21,530
I don't mean to be rude, but, um, I haven't heard Chris say the word husband in, like,

48
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:23,530
what, two decades?

49
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:24,530
Antoine.

50
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:26,530
He was also in my high school gang.

51
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:30,530
And if you can believe it, his mouth was even bigger back then.

52
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:32,530
Well, welcome to my place.

53
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:34,530
And there's only one rule here.

54
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:35,530
Chris makes all the rules.

55
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:37,530
Shut up Antoine.

56
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:39,530
You only say that when you're in trouble.

57
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:43,530
And those two drinks on the house, something must be really wrong.

58
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:48,849
Well, did you guys ever hear this real estate conglomerate called G5?

59
00:03:48,849 --> 00:03:51,169
They want to buy this place.

60
00:03:51,169 --> 00:03:55,169
So, take the money, go to Florida, meet some babes.

61
00:03:55,169 --> 00:03:57,169
We get a new bowling alley.

62
00:03:57,169 --> 00:03:58,169
Win, win.

63
00:03:58,169 --> 00:04:03,259
I thought about it, but they're only offering half the going range.

64
00:04:03,259 --> 00:04:05,259
Oh, hell with them then.

65
00:04:05,259 --> 00:04:07,259
Sorry Antoine, you're stuck with us.

66
00:04:07,259 --> 00:04:10,360
And unless they do something to force me.

67
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,360
Mmm.

68
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,360
Mmm.

69
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,870
Mmm.

70
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:17,209
Who's the boss?

71
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:24,040
Who's the boss?

72
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,040
That would be me.

73
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,709
Whoa.

74
00:04:26,709 --> 00:04:27,709
Could I help you?

75
00:04:27,709 --> 00:04:28,709
I'm Griffin.

76
00:04:28,709 --> 00:04:30,709
Boss of the Griffin's.

77
00:04:30,709 --> 00:04:32,709
Open your register.

78
00:04:32,709 --> 00:04:33,709
We're taking your money.

79
00:04:33,709 --> 00:04:35,709
That's not going to happen to me.

80
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:37,709
You were tired fat ass.

81
00:04:37,709 --> 00:04:38,709
Put that thing down.

82
00:04:38,709 --> 00:04:40,709
Shut your mouth grandma.

83
00:04:40,709 --> 00:04:41,709
Mind your shit.

84
00:04:41,709 --> 00:04:42,709
I'll blow him away.

85
00:04:43,709 --> 00:04:44,709
Robbery is one thing.

86
00:04:44,709 --> 00:04:45,709
Murder.

87
00:04:45,709 --> 00:04:47,709
You can't come back from that.

88
00:04:47,709 --> 00:04:48,709
We talk.

89
00:04:48,709 --> 00:04:49,709
You business old bitch.

90
00:04:49,709 --> 00:04:52,709
You have Jesus Christ in this fucking neighborhood.

91
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:54,709
When did Jesus pack a 45?

92
00:04:54,709 --> 00:04:59,939
I'll shoot you piece of shit.

93
00:04:59,939 --> 00:05:00,939
Nobody tells me what to do.

94
00:05:00,939 --> 00:05:01,939
Young man.

95
00:05:01,939 --> 00:05:03,939
Don't talk to me like a fucking teenager.

96
00:05:03,939 --> 00:05:06,939
This isn't the first time somebody's tried to rob this guy.

97
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:08,939
Look, he may look soft.

98
00:05:08,939 --> 00:05:09,939
He's not a coward.

99
00:05:09,939 --> 00:05:11,939
No means no.

100
00:05:11,939 --> 00:05:18,269
Shut the fuck up.

101
00:05:18,269 --> 00:05:19,269
Wait.

102
00:05:19,269 --> 00:05:21,269
Let's talk business, okay?

103
00:05:21,269 --> 00:05:22,269
Bullying an old man?

104
00:05:22,269 --> 00:05:24,269
That's not how a leader acts, is it?

105
00:05:24,269 --> 00:05:27,389
What are you talking about?

106
00:05:27,389 --> 00:05:28,680
Move on.

107
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,680
Take your business else.

108
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,680
Bullshit.

109
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,680
The fucking talking about.

110
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,680
Griffin.

111
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,680
The world doesn't work the way you think it does.

112
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,680
It's much more complicated.

113
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,889
I know Vlad.

114
00:05:39,889 --> 00:05:40,889
Vladimir Markov.

115
00:05:40,889 --> 00:05:42,889
You know who he is?

116
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:44,889
I doubt he knows who he is.

117
00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:46,889
He runs the other side of town.

118
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:47,889
Like I said,

119
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,889
world's a complicated place.

120
00:05:49,889 --> 00:05:54,889
Now what would happen if Vladimir find out you're messing with some of his friends?

121
00:05:54,889 --> 00:05:57,879
How would that turn out for you?

122
00:05:57,879 --> 00:06:03,100
Don't worry.

123
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,100
I got it better, right?

124
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,579
One that doesn't end with you at the bottom of a river.

125
00:06:08,579 --> 00:06:09,579
What is it?

126
00:06:09,579 --> 00:06:10,579
The block.

127
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:15,579
Between Mulberry Street and Lincoln has a ton of trust fund babies, right?

128
00:06:15,579 --> 00:06:18,579
Deep pockets and lots of addictions.

129
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:20,579
You know what to do.

130
00:06:20,579 --> 00:06:21,579
Thank you, sir.

131
00:06:21,579 --> 00:06:22,579
May we have your name?

132
00:06:22,579 --> 00:06:23,579
Fuck off.

133
00:06:24,579 --> 00:06:25,579
Now.

134
00:06:25,579 --> 00:06:34,860
I think that'll keep busy for a while.

135
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:35,860
So that's your secret?

136
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:36,860
You're one of them?

137
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,860
One of those bastards?

138
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:39,860
No.

139
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:42,860
Well, you just told them to go sell drugs.

140
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:43,860
Are you crazy?

141
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:44,860
Hang on.

142
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:45,860
Wait, wait, wait.

143
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:46,860
Don't be such a judgement so quickly.

144
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,860
Do you know who lives on that block?

145
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:51,860
Devin Jones and Alex Shaw.

146
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,860
The mayor and the chief of police.

147
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:56,180
Thank you.

148
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,180
Two of the most conservative guys in town.

149
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:02,180
Oh, they'll just love this dude slinging drugs outside his window.

150
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,180
Wait, you just did that?

151
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,180
Jesus Christ.

152
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:07,180
You really are a bad boy.

153
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:11,180
And Officer Alex packed to be one of my old friends.

154
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:16,180
So, so you better tell them these crazies are heading towards their neighborhood.

155
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:23,819
Chris, I like this guy.

156
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:24,819
Where'd you find him?

157
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,819
Had a random coffee shop.

158
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:27,819
It's a long story.

159
00:07:27,819 --> 00:07:28,819
I bet it's a good one.

160
00:07:28,819 --> 00:07:29,819
With me?

161
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:30,819
Always.

162
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:34,850
You know, I'm just, I'm just happy I found another good man.

163
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:42,449
You know, um, kind of reminds me of Jerry, his late husband.

164
00:07:42,449 --> 00:07:53,240
He doesn't like it.

165
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,240
No, not his looks.

166
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,240
You know, he's five, how he carries himself.

167
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:04,259
But a Jerry never really died in that accident.

168
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:10,370
But a Jerry never really died in that accident.

169
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:12,500
No!

170
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,959
Jerry.

171
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:19,779
Jerry is dead.

172
00:08:19,779 --> 00:08:21,199
My bad.

173
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:27,100
If he was alive, he would have come looking for me.

174
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:36,740
You okay?

175
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,820
Fine.

176
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:51,240
You, you look different.

177
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,240
I do.

178
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,590
It must be all the excitement.

179
00:08:55,590 --> 00:09:00,820
Well, I am planning to have a Christmas dinner at my place.

180
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:01,820
I want you to come.

181
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:02,820
Meet all my family.

182
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:03,820
Would you come?

183
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:04,820
Of course.

184
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:20,330
It would be my honor.

185
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:24,370
Mom.

186
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:25,370
Please.

187
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:26,370
Come in.

188
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:27,429
Please.

189
00:09:27,429 --> 00:09:28,429
Tom.

190
00:09:28,429 --> 00:09:30,720
I just want to quickly say.

191
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,720
Mom.

192
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,720
I'm so sorry about the other one.

193
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:39,679
It's just Tom's been working on a hard case and you know, we have a daughter on the way and

194
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:40,679
it's just been a lot of pressure.

195
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:43,679
I'm really sorry when I said.

196
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,379
It's okay.

197
00:09:45,379 --> 00:09:47,379
I made a lot of mistakes.

198
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:52,919
And some of them, some of them I can't fix.

199
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:56,919
But I didn't come here to talk about the past.

200
00:09:56,919 --> 00:09:58,919
I can't tell you.

201
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:00,919
I'm, I'm married.

202
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:02,919
You're married?

203
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:04,919
That's wonderful, Mom.

204
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:05,919
He's the sweetest man.

205
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:06,919
I know you're going to love him.

206
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:08,919
And I want you to meet him at Christmas dinner.

207
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:09,919
We would love that.

208
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:11,919
Dad would be so happy.

209
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:17,919
I mean, he was always getting trouble and I'm sure he's out there looking down with a smile.

210
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:20,139
I think someone has your back.

211
00:10:20,139 --> 00:10:21,139
Yeah.

212
00:10:21,139 --> 00:10:25,629
What is it?

213
00:10:25,629 --> 00:10:26,629
Something wrong?

214
00:10:26,629 --> 00:10:29,269
No, it's just Tom.

215
00:10:29,269 --> 00:10:36,460
After all these years, if you ever saw your father again, do you think you'd recognize him?

216
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,460
Yeah, of course I would.

217
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:42,259
I mean, he's in that picture right there behind you.

218
00:10:42,259 --> 00:10:49,029
I mean, I look at him every day.

219
00:10:49,029 --> 00:10:52,029
Anyway, it's getting late and I have to go.

220
00:10:52,029 --> 00:10:54,029
But I will see you guys at Christmas dinner.

221
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:55,029
Yeah, of course.

222
00:10:55,029 --> 00:11:08,230
Looking forward to it.

223
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:10,230
Why, I'm the lady.

224
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:12,809
But this place is cute.

225
00:11:12,809 --> 00:11:13,809
Is it new?

226
00:11:13,809 --> 00:11:14,809
It's just open.

227
00:11:14,809 --> 00:11:15,809
My daughter recommended it.

228
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:19,570
Well, she has great taste.

229
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:22,049
You must have raised her well.

230
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:27,009
For the last 20 years, it's been her and I against the world.

231
00:11:27,009 --> 00:11:28,009
She's my angel.

232
00:11:28,009 --> 00:11:30,740
Can I tell you something?

233
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:31,779
Of course.

234
00:11:31,779 --> 00:11:34,779
Sometimes I wish I had a girl instead of boy.

235
00:11:34,779 --> 00:11:36,779
Boys don't think.

236
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:41,820
Like, it's not with their brains.

237
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:44,559
I'm on John's head.

238
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:48,539
Are you with them?

239
00:11:48,539 --> 00:11:50,750
Emma?

240
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,509
Dad?

241
00:11:53,509 --> 00:11:58,830
Emma.

242
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:00,980
John?

243
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,980
Dad, do not look at it.

244
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,590
Look at me.

245
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,039
Go.

246
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:09,289
Emma, I told you.

247
00:12:09,289 --> 00:12:11,289
Stay away from this alcoholic.

248
00:12:11,289 --> 00:12:13,289
Can you just leave us alone?

249
00:12:13,289 --> 00:12:19,289
Okay, because my life and what I do with it is none of your business.

250
00:12:19,289 --> 00:12:21,289
You're free to date whoever you want.

251
00:12:21,289 --> 00:12:22,289
But not him.

252
00:12:22,289 --> 00:12:23,289
Remember what happened last time?

253
00:12:23,289 --> 00:12:25,289
John nearly burned our house down.

254
00:12:25,289 --> 00:12:27,289
That's my life and my business.

255
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:28,289
Not to mention it.

256
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:29,289
He nearly got you killed.

257
00:12:29,289 --> 00:12:30,289
You know, where do you get off?

258
00:12:30,289 --> 00:12:32,289
Okay, because maybe.

259
00:12:32,289 --> 00:12:38,149
If you knew the first thing about love, ditch us.

260
00:12:38,149 --> 00:12:39,409
20 years ago.

261
00:12:39,409 --> 00:12:43,580
You don't know what you're talking about.

262
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,620
What I'm talking about?

263
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:48,120
Well, Bob didn't ditch us.

264
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:52,120
Then why is the only thing she left this old photo?

265
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,120
Hmm?

266
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,860
Did you teach her this shit?

267
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,379
Get out.

268
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:02,379
I don't even want to fucking see you again.

269
00:13:02,379 --> 00:13:10,909
Then I'm going with him.

270
00:13:10,909 --> 00:13:13,649
Hold on, honey.

271
00:13:13,649 --> 00:13:14,649
Let's talk.

272
00:13:14,649 --> 00:13:18,860
And who the hell are you?

273
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,210
That boy's.

274
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:22,210
Give us a space.

275
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:32,690
You didn't mean to do that, did you?

276
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:33,690
Of course not.

277
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:36,009
But how can I?

278
00:13:36,009 --> 00:13:38,009
You know, he doesn't trust me.

279
00:13:38,009 --> 00:13:39,009
It was strong.

280
00:13:39,009 --> 00:13:43,100
What's that last time your father mentioned?

281
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:50,419
So my dad invited John over for Thanksgiving dinner.

282
00:13:50,419 --> 00:13:51,419
Right.

283
00:13:51,419 --> 00:13:53,419
And John's a shy boy.

284
00:13:53,419 --> 00:13:56,549
He didn't really know what to do.

285
00:13:56,549 --> 00:14:01,549
So his friends started giving him some advice.

286
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:05,649
And that's when everything hit wrong.

287
00:14:05,649 --> 00:14:07,610
Tell me everything.

288
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:15,139
Well John doesn't drink much.

289
00:14:15,139 --> 00:14:20,139
His friends suggested that maybe a little liquor may help him loosen up.

290
00:14:20,139 --> 00:14:22,139
But keyword a little.

291
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:25,139
John got so drunk.

292
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:28,139
And he drove me home.

293
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:34,139
Fashed the car straight into my dad's garden.

294
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:37,139
Dear, I can only imagine how Jerry reacted to that.

295
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:42,419
But whatever you're imagining, it's way, way worse.

296
00:14:42,419 --> 00:14:47,679
I mean, my dad's actually a really respectful man.

297
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:48,679
You know?

298
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:52,679
I mean he didn't even say anything about the car or the garden.

299
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:55,679
He just, he even invited John to come in.

300
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:56,679
It's over up.

301
00:14:56,679 --> 00:15:02,950
But John was like, I mean like blind truck.

302
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:08,460
So he stumbles in and knocks over a candle

303
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:11,460
and sets the curtains on fire.

304
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:14,659
Yeah, it's a nightmare as well.

305
00:15:14,659 --> 00:15:19,649
But you know, like John's not like that.

306
00:15:19,649 --> 00:15:24,649
You know, John is gentle and smart and caring.

307
00:15:24,649 --> 00:15:26,649
Yeah, but he's not a drunk.

308
00:15:26,649 --> 00:15:27,649
Okay?

309
00:15:27,649 --> 00:15:28,649
He was just one mistake.

310
00:15:28,649 --> 00:15:29,649
One time.

311
00:15:29,649 --> 00:15:30,649
My dad won't let it go.

312
00:15:30,649 --> 00:15:31,649
Gotcha girl.

313
00:15:31,649 --> 00:15:35,700
It was just a misunderstanding.

314
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,700
I don't understand.

315
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,700
You know?

316
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:38,700
Who are you?

317
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,700
How do you know my dad?

318
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,100
Baby, you look a bit drunk.

319
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,580
You gonna ride home?

320
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:47,580
Go away.

321
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,580
Is none of your business?

322
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,190
No.

323
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:52,190
Fuckin' you, granny.

324
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:53,190
Go home and fuck yourself.

325
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:55,190
Don't make me repeat myself.

326
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:57,190
Oh my God.

327
00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:00,190
You're coming with me, huh?

328
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:01,190
No.

329
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:04,590
I'm sorry, man.

330
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:05,590
I should have jumped in sooner.

331
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:08,169
I'd like you kid.

332
00:16:08,169 --> 00:16:09,169
Get her home safe.

333
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:10,169
I'll take care of her old man.

334
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:11,169
Thank you very much.

335
00:16:11,169 --> 00:16:13,169
You want me to hear me?

336
00:16:13,169 --> 00:16:14,169
You ready to go home?

337
00:16:14,169 --> 00:16:15,679
Yeah.

338
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:16,679
Oh.

339
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:18,679
Jerry and I are hosting a Christmas dinner.

340
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:19,679
I would love for you to come.

341
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:20,679
Do not be late.

342
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:21,679
Thank you.

343
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:25,659
What a cute boy.

344
00:16:25,659 --> 00:16:32,179
Where is my husband?

345
00:16:32,179 --> 00:16:40,840
There's the old bitch.

346
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:48,950
There's the old bitch.

347
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:50,950
Oh, you've never learned the home, man.

348
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:52,950
Hey, your boy toy beat me at the bar.

349
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:54,950
And now you're gonna pay.

350
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:55,950
With that thing down.

351
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:56,950
Fuck you bitch.

352
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:57,950
Give me your money.

353
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,950
Take off your coat.

354
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:07,299
Where did you get that thing?

355
00:17:07,299 --> 00:17:08,299
I came with my truck.

356
00:17:08,299 --> 00:17:10,299
You know, to fix the car.

357
00:17:10,299 --> 00:17:12,299
I almost forgot your driver.

358
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:13,299
Oh.

359
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:14,299
Fuck.

360
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:16,220
Oh.

361
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:35,609
They know how to get yourself into trouble, don't you?

362
00:17:35,609 --> 00:17:38,609
Maybe I should start carrying a gun in my truck.

363
00:17:38,609 --> 00:17:39,609
Shut up.

364
00:17:39,609 --> 00:17:44,400
Er, John and I'm gonna be okay.

365
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,619
Hmm.

366
00:17:45,619 --> 00:17:49,809
John said you agreed to let him take Emma home.

367
00:17:49,809 --> 00:17:50,809
He's really not a bad kid.

368
00:17:50,809 --> 00:17:52,809
I think he should give him a second chance.

369
00:17:52,809 --> 00:17:54,809
You know he almost got Emma killed?

370
00:17:54,809 --> 00:17:55,869
He was like a monster.

371
00:17:55,869 --> 00:17:58,420
I think that's just an excuse.

372
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,019
Of course.

373
00:18:00,019 --> 00:18:02,019
You would have a problem with John no matter what.

374
00:18:02,019 --> 00:18:05,019
He could be a doctor, a lawyer, a senator.

375
00:18:05,019 --> 00:18:06,019
You'd still hate him.

376
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:11,309
Because what you really can't stand is suddenly taking your daughter away.

377
00:18:11,309 --> 00:18:13,309
You're probably right.

378
00:18:13,309 --> 00:18:16,359
Probably.

379
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:17,359
You are.

380
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:26,619
If John deserves my daughter, then I'll dance if they're wedding.

381
00:18:26,619 --> 00:18:29,539
Can you still dance?

382
00:18:29,539 --> 00:18:35,480
Let me show you.

383
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,480
Hmm.

384
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:47,990
Hmm.

385
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:50,990
Paul, cancel all my plans for Christmas.

386
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:52,990
All of your appointments.

387
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:53,990
That's right.

388
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:56,990
Boss, you're invited to the White House for dinner on Christmas.

389
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:59,089
So how many more reports come up?

390
00:18:59,089 --> 00:19:00,089
Tell me.

391
00:19:00,089 --> 00:19:02,089
What's more important than the President?

392
00:19:02,089 --> 00:19:05,619
Stop!

393
00:19:05,619 --> 00:19:06,619
You're early.

394
00:19:06,619 --> 00:19:08,619
Today's meeting is too important to be late to.

395
00:19:08,619 --> 00:19:12,619
But I am curious what's more important than the President.

396
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:14,619
My wife and I are hosting a Christmas party.

397
00:19:14,619 --> 00:19:15,660
You should come.

398
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:16,660
Oh, thanks, Mr. Smith.

399
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:21,660
But my mother would be furious if I missed her Christmas party.

400
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,980
That's all right.

401
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,980
Say hi to your mother for me, okay?

402
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:28,069
And tell her, I wish I had a son like you.

403
00:19:28,069 --> 00:19:31,220
Really?

404
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,220
I wish the melons were right.

405
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,220
That would be nice.

406
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,220
The table.

407
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,220
Ooh.

408
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,220
This one's right.

409
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,220
Think.

410
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:48,839
Yeah.

411
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:49,839
This one's right.

412
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:52,339
Think.

413
00:19:52,339 --> 00:19:53,339
Yeah.

414
00:19:53,339 --> 00:19:54,339
Do you think we have enough for Christmas now?

415
00:19:54,339 --> 00:19:55,339
Yeah.

416
00:19:55,339 --> 00:19:56,339
Thank you so much for coming with me, sweetheart.

417
00:19:56,339 --> 00:19:57,339
It's the least I could do after the other day.

418
00:19:57,339 --> 00:19:59,339
Tom really went overboard.

419
00:19:59,339 --> 00:20:04,339
If I let every silly thing that boy said bother me, I would have been dead 100 years ago.

420
00:20:04,339 --> 00:20:05,339
Let's go.

421
00:20:05,339 --> 00:20:06,539
What else?

422
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:12,910
Fill the cap.

423
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:13,910
Now, do it.

424
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:15,009
Everybody down.

425
00:20:15,009 --> 00:20:16,009
I went through your hands.

426
00:20:16,009 --> 00:20:18,670
What should we do?

427
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:23,019
The title transfer from party A shall not.

428
00:20:23,019 --> 00:20:24,019
No.

429
00:20:24,019 --> 00:20:25,109
What?

430
00:20:25,109 --> 00:20:32,740
What?

431
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:33,740
Mr. Smith, are you all right?

432
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:34,740
Fine.

433
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,890
Fine.

434
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:38,920
Said a weird feeling about something.

435
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,140
Like a bad feeling?

436
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,500
Not sure.

437
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,859
What should we do?

438
00:20:45,859 --> 00:20:46,859
We're pretty close to the entrance.

439
00:20:46,859 --> 00:20:49,859
Just follow me when he walks away.

440
00:20:49,859 --> 00:20:55,160
It's a good run.

441
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,220
Don't move.
