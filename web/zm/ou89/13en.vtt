00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:03.779
I'll come to you.

2
00:00:03.779 --> 00:00:06.089
Who's there?

3
00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.939
Come out.

4
00:00:08.939 --> 00:00:09.939
Don't make me ask again.

5
00:00:09.939 --> 00:00:13.140
My team is done in appraisal for the property.

6
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:14.140
It looks nice.

7
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.329
And I think...

8
00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:21.850
This is my thing.

9
00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:22.850
Okay.

10
00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.059
Just feels a little bit drier.

11
00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:29.769
Mom, turn down the AC a little.

12
00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:31.960
Yeah, of course.

13
00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.390
Why don't we all just take a break?

14
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.390
I could use the fresh air, too.

15
00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:47.579
Oh, my God.

16
00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.130
Everything all right, Tom?

17
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:50.609
I think something's wrong.

18
00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:51.609
My mom just called in.

19
00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:53.609
She never calls me this way in.

20
00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:55.609
Let alone on a weekday.

21
00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:56.609
My wife's with her.

22
00:00:56.609 --> 00:00:57.609
In.

23
00:00:57.609 --> 00:00:58.609
In.

24
00:00:58.609 --> 00:00:59.609
Calm down.

25
00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.609
I'm sure everything's fine.

26
00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:03.609
Paul, can you check the news?

27
00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:04.609
Sure.

28
00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:05.859
Now.

29
00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:09.859
It seems like a shooting is happening in West Maple Street.

30
00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:10.859
See?

31
00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:11.859
And the live stream.
