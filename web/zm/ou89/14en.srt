1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,560
Even if I'm robbery inside a local store, are you okay?

2
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:19,519
You know what, I'm just broke.

3
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:23,559
Don't shoot.

4
00:00:23,559 --> 00:00:25,179
That bastard.

5
00:00:25,179 --> 00:00:28,899
Oh my God, Mr. Smith, I need to get there as fast as I can.

6
00:00:28,899 --> 00:00:30,940
I'm going with you.

7
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:31,940
Get the car ready.

8
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,990
Missa?

9
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:36,399
This country needs gun control.

10
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,780
Let me get my weapon.

11
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,450
With the gun down.

12
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:42,770
Get underneath, now.

13
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:46,039
Okay, okay.

14
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:46,880
What do you want?

15
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,439
If you want money, you can have it.

16
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:50,500
There are your pockets.

17
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,380
Please, my daughter's about to give birth

18
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:53,820
and please just let us go.

19
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,619
We won't do anything, I promise.

20
00:00:55,619 --> 00:00:57,259
Please, please, please get up whatever you want.

21
00:00:57,259 --> 00:01:00,210
Just don't hurt us.

22
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:02,329
Leave your phone, wallet and purse.

23
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:03,170
And get out.

24
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:04,170
Don't tell anybody what happened here.

25
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:05,609
Yes, thank you so much.

26
00:01:05,609 --> 00:01:07,049
Okay, of course.
