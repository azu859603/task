1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,600
Did you call the cops?

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:03,560
No, no, no. Of course not, I didn't.

3
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:11,939
Why would I?

4
00:00:11,939 --> 00:00:12,939
Why aren't I here?

5
00:00:12,939 --> 00:00:13,980
How could they know?

6
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,580
Um, I don't know.

7
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:18,559
Maybe there's an alarm?

8
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:21,460
Let me see your phone.

9
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:24,059
Please, it's not too late to surrender, right?

10
00:00:24,059 --> 00:00:26,179
You haven't done anything bad yet.

11
00:00:26,179 --> 00:00:28,949
My son, he's a really good lawyer.

12
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:30,789
He could defend you.

13
00:00:30,789 --> 00:00:33,329
They just should kill you.

14
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:35,969
They're going to lock me up because of you.

15
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:37,490
Say goodbye to your daughter and the baby.

16
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:39,229
No!

17
00:00:39,229 --> 00:00:40,829
Don't you fucking dare!
