1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,080
If you shoot us, there won't be an arrest.

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:04,000
There won't be a trial.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,679
They will, police will just tell you where you are.

4
00:00:06,679 --> 00:00:08,080
Well, if you didn't call the fucking cops,

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,080
it'd be halfway out of town by now.

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,359
It isn't too late to change your mind.

7
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:15,919
Think of your family, right?

8
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:17,199
They do think you're a murderer,

9
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,920
and they'd be heartbroken if they knew their son

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,920
was a murderer.

11
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,839
Keep my family out of your mouth.

12
00:00:22,839 --> 00:00:24,719
I won't let those fucking cops catch me.

13
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:26,320
I won't be a jail for the next 20 years,

14
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,920
and then below let you.

15
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:33,039
Do not bear your cursed life with mine, OK?

16
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:35,979
I'm not a failure.

17
00:00:35,979 --> 00:00:41,429
I'm not alone, and I'm not a certified felon like you are.

18
00:00:41,429 --> 00:00:44,030
Oh, God, if my husband was alive,

19
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:46,549
he would shoot you right on the spot.
