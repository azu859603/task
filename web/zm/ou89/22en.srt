Tom, my man

Haven't seen you around the bowling alley lately. I know you really missed you

Me and Lisa are busy. Oh

00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:38,280
Little too busy for his uncle Antoine. We just had a baby. What? Yeah

Remember Antoine's mac and cheese

00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:54,020
Amazing, I'm sure it's great, but mom please there's something that I really need to talk to you

00:00:54,020 --> 00:01:00,340
Just give me a moment to tell you always just a little busy right now. Why don't you um, go watch the football with Antoine
