1
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:02,910
May I come in, darling?

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:05,980
Is this Tom Cruise?

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:09,980
His, uh, I can expect Jerry.

4
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:16,969
You're part of the family now.

5
00:00:16,969 --> 00:00:20,019
Don't let him adapt.

6
00:00:20,019 --> 00:00:21,019
Dad!

7
00:00:21,019 --> 00:00:24,050
I went and dream of it.

8
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:32,740
Follow me, boys and girls.

9
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:35,740
You're sweat early like good, but...

10
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:38,740
Jerry! My old friend.

11
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:39,770
How are you?

12
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:40,770
Very well.

13
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:43,770
Now that we're finally, all we get.

14
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:46,770
This is Antoine, my best friend.

15
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:47,770
Hello.

16
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:51,700
And this is Tom, my son.

17
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,700
I believe some of you already know him.

18
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,909
Great to see you again.

19
00:00:56,909 --> 00:01:00,710
I'm so glad that we're truly a family now.

20
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:04,819
Nice to meet you again, Mr. Smith.

21
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:10,579
I'm afraid there's many things that you have not told my mother.

22
00:01:10,579 --> 00:01:11,579
Tom!

23
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:20,200
Mom, did you know that your new husband is the richest man in the state?

24
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,200
I didn't mean to...

25
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,650
Tom?

26
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:23,650
Come with me.

27
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:47,540
Could we just have one day of peace and quiet one day

28
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:50,540
when you are trying to play some game?

29
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:52,540
I just found out yesterday.

30
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:53,540
I had to say something.

31
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:56,500
Mom, I know you.

32
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,500
Okay?

33
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,500
You wouldn't be with him if you knew about his past.

34
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,620
You would think he's way out of our league.

35
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:07,870
Did you know he's supposed to be having dinner with the President,

36
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:10,870
the President of the United States?

37
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:14,870
I mean, the press is already wondering why he's missing and where he is.

38
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:17,159
If they find out that you two are married,

39
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:23,569
you're going to have journalists sticking their noses in every aspect of your life.

40
00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:26,340
They're going to take away your freedom.

41
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:31,669
Wow, you really are a liar.

42
00:02:31,669 --> 00:02:33,669
Oh, this isn't a joke.

43
00:02:33,669 --> 00:02:36,669
Do you really want to be a fixture in the tabloids because you will?

44
00:02:36,669 --> 00:02:37,669
Tom?

45
00:02:37,669 --> 00:02:38,960
What?

46
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,990
I mean, beyond everything I just said, have you thought about it?

47
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:44,990
Have you thought about why he's keeping this from you?

48
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:46,990
Why he's hiding it?

49
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:49,090
That man doesn't trust you.

50
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:51,219
I do trust your mom.

51
00:02:51,219 --> 00:02:59,199
I trust her with all my heart.

52
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:02,289
It's just that everything happened too fast.

53
00:03:02,289 --> 00:03:05,289
I couldn't find the right time.

54
00:03:05,289 --> 00:03:06,289
Bullshit.

55
00:03:06,289 --> 00:03:08,759
Everything.

56
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:10,759
Mr. Ober driver.

57
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:15,979
Mr. Smith, I've worked for you for many years and I trust you as a boss and a father,

58
00:03:15,979 --> 00:03:18,979
but I can't sit by and let you lie to my mother.

59
00:03:18,979 --> 00:03:20,050
I swear.

60
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:21,050
I just...

61
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:24,939
Tom, they appreciate you telling me.

62
00:03:24,939 --> 00:03:30,580
I should have waited one day just one more day so I couldn't have my Christmas.

63
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:42,550
What's the use of marriage if nothing's ever shared?

64
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,550
You said that before, didn't you?

65
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:46,550
I'm really sorry.

66
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:49,580
I'm just...

67
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:51,580
I never met for any of this to happen.

68
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:55,060
I was trying to find the best moment.

69
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,060
I need some time.

70
00:03:56,060 --> 00:04:06,310
Some space.

71
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,310
God.

72
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:09,020
This is bad.

73
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:12,590
Tom Schitt, you know, brought that up at Christmas.

74
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:16,589
I mean, if someone was lying to my mom, I'd probably do the same thing.

75
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:17,589
Emma.

76
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:18,589
Not the time.

77
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:23,819
I'm sorry, guys.

78
00:04:23,819 --> 00:04:24,819
I ruined Christmas.

79
00:04:24,819 --> 00:04:35,899
Dad, I'm sorry.

80
00:04:35,899 --> 00:04:38,279
I...

81
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:39,279
I was screwed up.

82
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:47,100
Where did that photo come from?

83
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,699
It's a family photo.

84
00:04:49,699 --> 00:04:51,699
When I was younger.

85
00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:56,930
Your family?

86
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:05,110
That's your father, your mother, your sister, and yourself?

87
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:08,110
I don't understand what's the big deal.

88
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:28,899
Don't push up your way.

89
00:05:28,899 --> 00:05:31,899
I've searched for 20 years to find someone like you.

90
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:34,410
You make me feel young.

91
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:39,379
And alive.

92
00:05:39,379 --> 00:05:41,379
You have to understand.

93
00:05:41,379 --> 00:05:44,379
Ever since the tragedy, I've only lived for my daughter.

94
00:05:44,379 --> 00:05:47,980
She's the only thing I have left.

95
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:52,379
Now she has John.

96
00:05:52,379 --> 00:05:53,379
My job is done.

97
00:05:53,379 --> 00:05:56,569
She's safe.

98
00:05:56,569 --> 00:05:57,569
And loved.

99
00:05:57,569 --> 00:06:01,709
But I have no one.

100
00:06:01,709 --> 00:06:06,339
No one except you.

101
00:06:06,339 --> 00:06:09,829
Please.

102
00:06:09,829 --> 00:06:11,860
Please.

103
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:12,860
I don't want to stand.

104
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:21,750
Be about the tragedy that 20 years ago.

105
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:22,750
Where did you get this?

106
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:30,379
This is the last thing that my mother left me.

107
00:06:30,379 --> 00:06:33,379
She died in a landslide 20 years ago.

108
00:06:33,379 --> 00:06:34,379
On the land side, where?

109
00:06:34,379 --> 00:06:35,379
Maple.

110
00:06:35,379 --> 00:06:41,500
So the barren mountain, 40 miles north of Anchorage, Alaska?

111
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,209
Yeah.

112
00:06:43,209 --> 00:06:46,209
It's exactly where Dad said that she...

113
00:06:46,209 --> 00:06:47,209
Dad?

114
00:06:47,209 --> 00:06:49,500
Mr. Smith?

115
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,550
No, no, there's no way.

116
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,550
He looks completely different.

117
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:59,129
The landslide nearly crushed his skull.

118
00:06:59,129 --> 00:07:01,129
The doctors had to give him a whole new face.

119
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:07,930
This is Christ.

120
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:08,930
He's my dad.

121
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:22,259
20 years ago.

122
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:24,259
My family went up to a barren mountain.

123
00:07:24,259 --> 00:07:29,810
Like today's not crazy enough.

124
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:30,970
Jesus.

125
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:34,220
I'm gonna kill whoever is at the door.

126
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,220
Mom.

127
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,220
Mom, wait a second.

128
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,959
Do you remember our family photo on the wall?

129
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:39,959
Yeah, of course.

130
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:40,959
What about it?

131
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:42,959
Oh my gosh, just look at this.

132
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:47,180
Do you recognize that photo?

133
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,180
Why is this photo water damaged?

134
00:07:49,180 --> 00:08:01,569
Huh.

135
00:08:01,569 --> 00:08:17,680
Chris says, what is your book?

136
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,680
This is your Christmas gift.

137
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,100
What are you talking about?

138
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:36,529
This is what you get.

139
00:08:36,529 --> 00:08:57,379
I'm gonna kill all of ya.

140
00:08:57,379 --> 00:08:58,379
Get some rope.

141
00:08:58,379 --> 00:08:59,730
Fuck you all.

142
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:03,860
What the fuck up?

143
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:14,220
That was enough craziness for one day.

144
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,220
Let's get this asshole out of here.

145
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,220
Just wait here.

146
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,220
John and I got this.

147
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:21,220
Big thanks on playing here.

148
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,919
Let's go.

149
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:41,960
Well, looks like someone made the naughty list this year.

150
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,960
What happened to you?

151
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:46,559
Why do you look so different?

152
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:51,580
Why didn't you come back to me?

153
00:09:51,580 --> 00:10:00,039
What's the song about?

154
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:04,750
Is she?

155
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,799
That's Mom.

156
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:09,799
It's Tom.

157
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:11,409
That's right.

158
00:10:11,409 --> 00:10:16,830
I didn't recognize you before.

159
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:17,830
You're my son.

160
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:21,879
Tell me this is real.

161
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:22,879
Please.

162
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:26,610
You're my wife.

163
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:30,590
Chris that I married.

164
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:34,809
Did you hide Fankridge 20 years ago?

165
00:10:34,809 --> 00:10:36,100
Mount Maple.

166
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:40,340
I guess so.

167
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,779
My memory.

168
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:45,039
The accident.

169
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:50,159
I can't remember who I was.

170
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:51,159
My backpack.

171
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:52,159
My ID.

172
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:54,159
All gone.

173
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:58,370
The only thing we have left is...

174
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:03,690
And her.

175
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:07,279
Oh my god.

176
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,279
How did you survive?

177
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,940
Hunter.

178
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:14,169
Found us in the woods.

179
00:11:14,169 --> 00:11:17,230
Injured and cold but alive.

180
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:19,990
I thought...

181
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:21,860
I thought you.

182
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:22,860
And Tom?

183
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:27,320
I thought you were dead.

184
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:32,070
I thought you were dead too.

185
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:47,419
Tom, get in here.

186
00:11:47,419 --> 00:11:48,419
Group hug.

187
00:11:48,419 --> 00:11:49,419
Come on.

188
00:11:49,419 --> 00:12:02,590
I came to this day a million times over but...

189
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:05,590
I never thought it would actually happen for real.

190
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:06,590
It's a...

191
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:11,700
A Christmas miracle.

192
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:23,909
A miracle.

193
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:31,889
Can I give me some?

194
00:12:31,889 --> 00:12:35,879
Darling, are you staying tonight?

195
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:36,879
Of course.

196
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:47,590
I waited over 20 years for this.

197
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:51,779
Thank you all for joining our family here today.

198
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:55,649
It's been a long road.

199
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:58,700
Strange journey.

200
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:02,220
But there is no place I'd rather be.

201
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:08,570
After 20 years apart, fate has given us the best Christmas gift of all.

202
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:11,429
Each other.

203
00:13:11,429 --> 00:13:12,429
Merry Christmas.

204
00:13:12,429 --> 00:13:14,429
Merry Christmas.
