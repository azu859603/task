00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,099
You can stop staring now

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:11,349
What is the youngest top-class lawyer in Manhattan, and he has never tasted feet. I didn't

3
00:00:12,349 --> 00:00:16,170
And no offense, but he's way out of your league

4
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:23,100
The business assistants are in the day and don't get any designs on him because he is a cold demon

5
00:00:23,739 --> 00:00:25,420
Like ruthless

6
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:30,739
Even with girls. Thank you for reminding me. I only want to learn from him

7
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,500
He's not my type. I have someone else in my heart

8
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,399
Good

9
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:49,600
Yes, I am as long as you're not married. You listen to your father. I'm no bargain

10
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:24,930
Your job is to sign this
