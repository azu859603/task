00:00:05.169 --> 00:00:08.060
He would be, I'm not a werewolf.

2
00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:08.859
Flying.

3
00:00:08.859 --> 00:00:10.859
How come the device didn't alarm?

4
00:00:10.859 --> 00:00:14.259
If you're not a werewolf, the device has been broken.

5
00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:15.160
It can't be.

6
00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.230
I'm confident in my technology.

7
00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.530
I came across the werewolf once.

8
00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:23.170
That must be the reason why.

9
00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:24.670
Have you met a werewolf before?

10
00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:25.670
Yes.

11
00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:27.070
Yes, I was attacked by a werewolf.

12
00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.649
That's the reason I took this case.

13
00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:31.309
That's strange.

14
00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:33.109
I met a werewolf too.

15
00:00:33.109 --> 00:00:36.520
Why didn't I ring until you came?

16
00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.189
Show me your wolf!

17
00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:42.600
She's bold, I'll come now.

18
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.600
No, she stood me up.

19
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:51.039
I'm not going to wait any longer.

20
00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:52.240
What happened there?

21
00:00:52.240 --> 00:01:03.049
You really a human?

22
00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:04.049
You're hurt.
