00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:06.950
So, boy, look, don't get me wrong, okay?

2
00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:14.380
My friend likes, guys, I've never broken an agreement.

3
00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:20.149
As long as you remember.

4
00:00:20.149 --> 00:00:27.839
Oh, my God, what happened?

5
00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:32.689
You got mistaken as a werewolf when my client almost killed me.

6
00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:35.030
That's so fucking dangerous.

7
00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.210
Oh, your boss is insane.

8
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:39.909
Why would he let you take that case?

9
00:00:39.909 --> 00:00:41.609
No, you don't badmouthe him.

10
00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:43.310
He's the best boss in the world.

11
00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:56.039
I'm so sorry I got caught up in work and I completely forgot.

12
00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.759
The same time in the same place by tomorrow.

13
00:00:59.759 --> 00:01:03.479
I, um, I got hurt.

14
00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:08.620
Can we postpone our meeting for another week?

15
00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.000
Thank you.

16
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.420
Um, who was that?

17
00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.620
My mate is urging me to cut times.

18
00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:18.219
Good.

19
00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:21.120
You know, you need to break up with him as soon as possible.

20
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.420
So you can please stop thinking about him.

21
00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.439
Do I?

22
00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:28.439
I'll wash up a suit tomorrow.

23
00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.959
Get back to when we meet again.

24
00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:32.459
We'll be over by then.

25
00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:36.849
Who is it?

26
00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:47.170
It's getting late.

27
00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:48.760
Where are you here?

28
00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.859
I'm sorry for hurting you today.

29
00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:52.859
But I've came across some new leads.

30
00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:54.359
Would you like to check them out?
