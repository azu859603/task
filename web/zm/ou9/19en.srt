1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Right, what are you doing?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Why are you here?

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I'm working.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Put him down, please.

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,779
I'm helping Lisa with work.

6
00:00:11,779 --> 00:00:12,779
What are you doing?

7
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:14,330
Are you okay?

8
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:17,329
So you're gonna care for another man right in front of me?

9
00:00:17,329 --> 00:00:19,320
Sorry.

10
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,320
Lisa, I wanted to help you with your work.

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,320
But obviously Brian has a problem with me being here.

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,320
So I'll leave.

13
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,420
Dylan.

14
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:31,850
You better stay away from him.

15
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:32,850
He's dangerous.

16
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:33,850
I told you.

17
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:35,850
He's my college buddy.

18
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:38,039
I'm not a bad person.

19
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:39,039
How do you know that?

20
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,030
I saw the way he looked at you.

21
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:44,609
Like he wanted to devour you.

22
00:00:44,609 --> 00:00:47,280
I'm your husband after all.

23
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,280
It's a fake marriage.

24
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,280
And we don't even look together.

25
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,280
So don't you think you're being a little bit possessive?

26
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,759
So that's so.

27
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:56,179
You can move in with me.

28
00:00:56,179 --> 00:00:58,689
So we can keep an eye on you.
