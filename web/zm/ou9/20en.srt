1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,109
I don't think that's going to be necessary.

2
00:00:03,109 --> 00:00:05,459
You don't get to decide.

3
00:00:05,459 --> 00:00:10,289
Well, get all the meat!

4
00:00:10,289 --> 00:00:12,800
From now on, you'll sleep here.

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,990
I'll be in the guest bedroom.

6
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:15,990
No, I have my own place.

7
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:17,989
Oh, it's in the contract.

8
00:00:17,989 --> 00:00:19,989
You must unconditionally obey me.

9
00:00:19,989 --> 00:00:22,989
And all of their arrangements related to our marriage.

10
00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:26,980
Unfair.

11
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:31,789
So you're going to break the contract?

12
00:00:31,789 --> 00:00:34,719
The common tract has a hefty breach for you.

13
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,719
I can't afford it.

14
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:39,719
I can stay here.

15
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:41,719
But we need ground.
