00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.179
I love it. Thank you.

2
00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:18.660
Everyone, please meet my wife, Lisa Sterling.

3
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.699
From now on, you will be paying her with respect.

4
00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:30.350
My dear, I've been so busy, and you've been going through so much.

5
00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:32.350
So, you're Brian's wife, huh?

6
00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.350
Tep said a secret for quite some time.

7
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.350
Jesse, all of these rumors slender, even sprained,

8
00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.350
not being here this time.

9
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.479
That can't be easily dismissed.

10
00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:46.479
You're a woman, too. As a woman, you should know how hurtful

11
00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:49.479
these rumors and gossip can be.

12
00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:51.700
So, if we know on, watch your mouth.

13
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.700
Because for all of you, too, we don't work at this law firm,

14
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.700
we should be mindful of what we're saying.

15
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.829
We're the face of this firm.

16
00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:16.329
What are you doing here?

17
00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:18.329
I've been looking all over for you.
