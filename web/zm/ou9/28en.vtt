00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.299
Lisa!

2
00:00:02.299 --> 00:00:09.400
I... I was... Jane, why should I face a baby?

3
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.400
It's hair dyed.

4
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.400
Okay, get in love.

5
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.399
You are so silly.

6
00:00:17.399 --> 00:00:19.399
Come on, let's go clean, though.

7
00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:31.699
Vitamin C is what gets hair dye off of face.

8
00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:41.469
Don't get the wrong way, dear.

9
00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:45.659
I'm just... I'm wearing these because I can find my pajamas.

10
00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:47.659
It's fine.

11
00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:48.659
I understand.

12
00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:49.659
Okay, it's not like...

13
00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:57.590
It's like I like you or something.

14
00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:06.540
Um, but you're clearly not sober yet, so...

15
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.769
We get something out of speed there now.

16
00:01:08.769 --> 00:01:10.769
No, no, you don't need to have a drug.

17
00:01:10.769 --> 00:01:11.769
You didn't?
