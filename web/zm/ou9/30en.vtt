00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.569
You! You!

2
00:00:02.569 --> 00:00:03.890
Spriton?

3
00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:07.549
How could that be?

4
00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:10.220
How could he be a terrifying werewolf?

5
00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:15.970
Oh my god, what should I do?

6
00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:21.649
Weird, it beeps and then it doesn't.

7
00:00:21.649 --> 00:00:25.410
Is it still broken?

8
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.850
That's where working.

9
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:37.759
These don't disturb us.

10
00:00:37.759 --> 00:00:39.759
You may try fixing it again.

11
00:00:39.759 --> 00:00:41.679
Weird, I just fixed it.

12
00:00:41.679 --> 00:01:26.459
Spriton really a werewolf thing for me.

13
00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:34.620
I had to tell you I think you should drop Mark's case.

14
00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:35.260
Why?

15
00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.530
Because it's special.

16
00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.739
It's dangerous.

17
00:01:40.739 --> 00:01:42.980
I've told the firm not to take it.

18
00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.260
That's the reason.

19
00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
Or is it because you're a werewolf?

20
00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:53.060
Perhaps you're even connected to the Ellen Street case.
