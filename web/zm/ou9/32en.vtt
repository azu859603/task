David he lied to me. He lied to me, and I hate him.

2
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:08.529
You know, I actually think Brian's been pretty good to you.

3
00:00:08.529 --> 00:00:10.529
What, you're gonna defend the werewolf?

4
00:00:10.529 --> 00:00:12.529
Okay, I think you're overreacting.

5
00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:17.530
Look, not all werewolves are evil. Some of them are good people.

6
00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:21.780
It's just the ones who hurt you are the ones that you hate.

7
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.780
If they're good werewolves, then why is everyone afraid of them?

8
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:29.780
Lisa, did you forget that the man who saved you was also a werewolf?

9
00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.969
Look, ask yourself this.

10
00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:37.420
Has Brian ever hurt you?

11
00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.420
You know, just because he's a werewolf doesn't mean that he's a bad guy.

12
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.799
Yeah.

13
00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:49.770
Maybe you're right.

14
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:56.000
I shouldn't hate him without knowing who he really is.

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.479
David, can I hear you? Can I stay with you until I figure everything out?

16
00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:02.479
Of course, honey.

17
00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:05.760
As long as you need.
